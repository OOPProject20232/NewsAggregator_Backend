The price structure of VVS Finance has been in a fierce battle, with bulls initially holding the upper hand. However, on March 9th, 2024, bears entered the game and caused bulls to lose momentum. As a result, bears took over and established lower lows and highs on the daily chart. The VVS Finance price remains below major resistance levels from the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and is tracking a downward trendline on the daily asset chart. Meanwhile, RSI is at 50.37, declining below by facing resistance from 14-SMA, and MACD is has formed a bearish cross and is at 0.0000000015. At the time of writing, the VVS Finance price has faced an increase of +2.30% since yesterday and was at $0.00000485 at press time. If the VVS Finance price asset drops below the $0.000004300 threshold support, it may continue to fall and reach lower points in the coming sessions. Conversely, should there be a surge in demand for the VVS Finance price asset, it may rebound significantly from its present price level. The next target for the price may be to hit $0.000005800, and beyond this price level, it could stretch up to $0.000006600. Social Dominance And Volume Evaluation Of VVS Finance The sentiment of social dominance can be used to gauge the degree of acceptance of VVS Finance cryptocurrency among users. During the specified time frame, the social dominance chart depicts that VVS Finance displays a downward trend. The social volume of the VVS Finance crypto seems to be declining in recent sessions. It indicates a continuation of the ongoing short-term trend and a fall in the social volume also indicates the decreasing awareness regarding VVS Finance crypto. The VVS Finance price may decrease due to the decline in social dominance, as the number of participants decreased, signaling low demand, possibly leading to a fall in the value of the VVS Finance asset. 30-Day Market Value To Realize Value Shows VVS Finance Price Is Likely To Decline The correlation between the price of VVS Finance and the MVRV rate over the past 30 days is shown in the chart. The MVRV ratio measures the average profit or loss that investors who bought VVS Finance in the past 30 days have experienced. The data indicates a positive relationship between the VVS Finance price and its MVRV rate, showing that they are both moving in sync. When the VVS Finance price rises, the increase in the MVRV ratio shows an increase in the number of participants. In the same way, if the VVS Finance price drops, the ratio will also drop, indicating that more investors are losing. The graph indicates a decrease in MVRV, with the 30-day MVRV ratio for the VVS Finance price falling, leading to a correction in price from the closest supply area. It shows that the VVS Finance price might plummet significantly if additional investors decide to sell, leading to a price fall. Summary VVS Finance\u2019s price structure faced a battle between bulls and bears, with bears gaining momentum on March 9th, 2024. The price remains below major resistance levels, tracking a downward trendline. RSI has declined, MACD formed a bearish cross, and the price saw a 2.30% increase since yesterday.

This move aims to provide users with increased accessibility and attractive incentives for staking their USDe stablecoins within the Ethena ecosystem. 20% Reward Boost For USDe Stakers As part of the integration, Ethena developers have introduced a lucrative reward system for users who lock their USDe stablecoins for at least 7 days through the supported exchange Web3 wallets. From the announcement date, eligible users will receive a 20% reward boost in the form of \u201cEthena sats.\u201d These sats can later be converted to the protocol\u2019s native ENA token at the end of each campaign, providing users with an additional incentive to participate in the staking process. Users must deposit their USDe stablecoins into their exchange wallets to qualify for the rewards, connect to the Ethena decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, and stake their holdings. The protocol has garnered significant attention. At the time of publication, its total value locked was $2.274 Billion, generating an impressive annualized revenue of $178 Million. Ecosystem Rewards Attract Substantial Usage Ethena\u2019s ecosystem rewards have proven to be a major draw for users, as evidenced by the high participation and staking activity levels. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain has reported that the top 10 wallets withdrew 37.5M ENA tokens, valued at $51 Million, and staked them in Ethena during Season 2. Ethena\u2019s Rise to Prominence The protocol experienced a meteoric rise since launching its USDe stablecoin in early 2023. Less than a month after its introduction, on March 8, Ethena became the highest-earning decentralized application in the cryptocurrency space by offering an impressive 67% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDe. Although the current APY has decreased to 24%, the protocol continues to attract a large user base and generate significant revenue. Addressing Concerns and Comparisons The high yields offered by Ethena have raised concerns among some observers, drawing comparisons to the failed Terra stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). However, Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs, has dismissed these comparisons as \u201cknee-jerk reactions\u201d in an interview with Cointelegraph on Feb. 22. Young highlighted that Ethena\u2019s yields are sustainable and natural, sourced from Ethereum\u2019s inflation rewards, ETH stakers\u2019 execution fees, maximal extractable value fees, and trading income from Ethena Labs. In contrast to the now-defunct UST yield protocol Anchor, which relied on venture capital funding to pay out yields, Ethena\u2019s yields are publicly verifiable and generated transparently. The firm opens short derivative positions when it receives long-position collateral assets for minting USDe, with the spread between the two positions being paid out to USDe holders as yield. Conclusion Ethena Labs\u2019 integration with major exchange wallets is a significant step in the protocol\u2019s growth. It aims to attract more users by offering better rewards and a smoother staking experience. The protocol sets itself apart with its sustainable yields and transparent approach. It aims to overcome past scrutiny in the DeFi space. Despite concerns about high yields, Ethena Labs is confident in its rewards system\u2019s authenticity and sustainability. With growing user support, Ethena looks to shape the future of DeFi and provide stablecoin stakers with attractive opportunities. As Ethena expands partnerships and integrations, it faces challenges and opportunities in the cryptocurrency and DeFi landscape.","article_summary":"Ethena Labs, a prominent synthetic stablecoin protocol, has announced its integration with the centralized exchange wallets of Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget as of April 10.

Market analytics platform Lookonchain observed notable transactions, with three major holders clearing a collective 2.03 million UNI tokens, valued at around $20 million, which corresponded to an approximate 17% dip in the token\u2019s market price. In particular, two digital wallets identified as 0x2F8b and 0x3555 moved 1.25 million UNI tokens, acquired from Binance on March 3, 2023, back to the exchange just an hour before the report, a move that could net an estimated $3.5 million upon sale. Similarly, another wallet, tagged 0x4A0B, liquidated 472,691 UNI tokens in exchange for 4.59 million USDC at a conversion rate of $9.71 per token, roughly seven hours earlier, culminating in a gain of $1.67 million. Moreover, a cluster of six wallets resettled 316,430 UNI tokens, worth $3.16 million, to Binance. Additionally, Lookonchain disclosed that the address whitzardflow.eth experienced a significant sell-off, parting with 107,010 UNI tokens, equivalent to $1 million, about an hour before the report. This address had previously collected 262,045 UNI tokens, priced at $3 million, from March 1 to March 13, securing them at an average cost of $11.42 each. UNI tokens were subsequently staked in Aave to secure a stablecoin loan of $1.8 million. However, the subsequent market drop for UNI tokens started a liquidation for whitzardflow.eth, showcasing the disposal of 107,010 UNI tokens to reconcile the debt. According to CoinMarketCap, the UNI token is currently trading at $9.33, after a drop of 14% in the past one day, and holds a market cap of $5,568,739,227.

A Famous Crypto That Could Be The Next Big Thing","author":"Ritika Sharma","article_detailed_content":"Pandoshi is a new cryptocurrency that is quickly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency scene due to its innovative approach and success in earlier funding stages In recent times, Pandoshi has drawn considerable investments, highlighting the market\u2019s faith in its potential and earning a name in the crypto community. The project stands out for its unique attributes and its ambitious vision to transform the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. What Is Pandoshi? While it could be mistaken for just another meme coin, Pandoshi embodies a completely independent and decentralized system. Pandoshi is committed to the principles of decentralization, preserving financial privacy, and giving the community a central role in shaping the project\u2019s direction. Pandoshi features a Layer-2 network that operates on a Proof of Stake protocol, providing a greener solution compared to the usual Proof of Work approach. In its ecosystem, users can access decentralized exchanges (DEX), secure wallets that users have full control over, interactive Metaverse games, educational resources such as Pandoshi University, and prepaid cards that work with cryptocurrencies, all operating without the requirement for Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. Panda Chain PandaChain is a blockchain solution that operates as a PoS (Proof-of-Stake) Layer-2. For the Pandoshi community to achieve true decentralization, it is necessary to have blockchain infrastructure that is cost-effective. PandaChain increases the burn rate, reducing the PAMBO circulating supply. It will serve as the official home for all Pandoshi and community projects, and will considerably reduce transaction fees for everyone within the ecosystem. PandaChain employs a variety of technologies and protocols, including the PolyBFT consensus mechanism, StateSync, and Checkpoints for bridging. Furthermore, it supports ERC standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 for token creation. Not forgetting thatone of its key features is the zkEVM, which enables zero-knowledge proofs on an EVM-compatible chain. PandaChain aims to guarantee minimal fees for every application, game, or service developed on its platform. Its primary transactional objective is to achieve transactions in seconds for mere fractions of a cent. Native Token of Pandoshi PAMBO, Pandoshi\u2019s native token, lies at the heart of its ecosystem. PAMBO was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a deflationary token, designed to increase in value as its rarity grows. It also includes a buy-and-burn system, a feature that prospective buyers often seek. The project has various components that reinforce the token\u2019s value, particularly its decentralized exchange, which charges fees on transactions. The fees collected are then used to buy more PAMBO tokens, contributing to the token\u2019s market value growth. Pandoshiswap PandoshiSwap is a decentralized exchange for cryptocurrencies that allows peer-to-peer trading without a middleman. Unlike Uniswap, PandoshiSwap will not unjustly ban assets and will remain true to the principles of DeFi. Additionally, the platform will never include \u201coptional\u201d KYC codes that could compromise users\u2019 privacy. PandoshiSwap is expected to support various chains and will have an internal bridge that allows for the transfer of assets from one chain to another. Moreover, the platform\u2019s fee structure will be set at 0.3%, with 70% of the fee revenue used to reward liquidity providers and the remaining 30% allocated towards the buy and burn of PAMBO. Now, once PandaChain is launched, PandoshiSwap will become the official DEX of the network. This will end up supporting all ecosystem tokens and those developed by the community for various projects. Pasoshi Wallet A secure wallet is essential in the ecosystem. Pandoshi achieves this by not collecting data. Initially, they support EVM. Later, as their white paper says, they are more likely to integrate non-EVM chains. Pandishi will add a swap, staking, recurring payments, and the ability to execute transactions without owning the native coin. They are also set to include many other new features. Cardoshi: The Virtual Prepaid Card Cardoshi is a new virtual prepaid card solution that allows people around the world to create and load virtual Visa/Mastercard prepaid cards using PAMBO tokens. If the user has PAMBO tokens, they can use the platform to easily create and load virtual prepaid Visa/Mastercard debit cards, and popular cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins, across various blockchains. These virtual cards have a maximum balance of $5000, a daily transaction limit of $2500, and are accepted by a vast number of global merchants. When the users do a card top-up, there is a nominal fee of 2%, which will be used to purchase and subsequently burn PAMBO tokens. This helps to reinforce the deflationary nature of the PAMBO token. The virtual cards will initially be available in the United States, followed by Europe, and then in other parts of the world. Pandoshi\u2019s Presale Pandoshi\u2019s presale is structured across five distinct stages. Currently in its third stage, the token is valued at $0.006. As the project moves into its fourth stage, the cost per token will rise to $0.008 and reach $0.01 in the final stage, representing a critical milestone for both the project and its investors. The project\u2019s roadmap includes plans to broaden social media engagement and enhance its ecosystem further. On X, Pandoshi recently shared the exciting news that they are ahead of schedule and are getting ready for the beta release of the Pandoshi Wallet. This is a significant development that is happening during their presale phase. Initially, the beta version of the wallet will offer support for all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. Also, plans are underway to broaden its compatibility to include non-EVM chains in subsequent updates. The wallet application will be available for both Android and iOS users to reach a broad user base. Conclusion Pandoshi is a community-driven blockchain project that aims to establish a decentralized ecosystem of products, including Network, DEX, Wallet, and more. The project values financial privacy and autonomy, and the users\u2019 interests are always prioritized in every product. Pandoshi is committed to decentralized finance, privacy, and user empowerment.

But for the price to recover, the bulls must stabilize at the lower levels before taking off. On the higher side, the EMAs may act as a dynamic resistance and entry point for the sellers. Bulls need to surpass the EMAs to register a price surge on the charts. Current price action favors the bears, however, the momentum is slow. The HEX price may continue to drop if the bearish pressure increases. HEX Crypto Volume Analysis The volume analysis shows that Hex cryptocurrency received nearly $276.84K in volume in the last 24 hours which is nearly 30% less than the previous day\u2019s volume.

The SAND asset is expressing bearish behavior as active addresses, whale activity, volume with price has declined and has the opportunity to fall further on the daily chart. It performed poorly last month with a 21.33% drop implying a stable downtrend. Since then, the Sandbox crypto has demonstrated a major decline as the price sank from a vital level of around $0.8000 on the chart. SAND crypto is almost at a big fall, as it meets the resistance level and could dive to new lows from the current price. The Sandbox price asset plunged below the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, reliant on the sellers\u2019 surge could deteriorate more. Likewise, the SAND price asset is displaying bearish characteristics as MACD is below the zero line at -0.0110 and the RSI is falling smoothly below the median line at 46.15, implying that the Sandbox asset is losing momentum and can achieve new depths in the coming sessions. At press time, the Sandbox crypto had experienced a 1.31% incline in the last 24 hours to $0.6193. Therefore, if the SAND price fails to stay above the $0.5500 level, it could decline further and reach lower lows. However, if the demand for the crypto remains high, the SAND asset price could bounce back from the current level by surpassing the below trendline. The next goal for Sandbox is to reach $0.7350 and $0.8000. SAND Crypto Price Vs Volume Analysis Moreover, the SAND price noted a significant and continuous fall in the volume inflow in the last few weeks along with the price decline. The average volume has fallen from $625 Million to $50 Million by the first week of April 2024.

Within the last hour, there were 39 transactions, in the past 24 hours, the number of transactions involving different addresses in Sandbox was 585, in the past 7 days was 5123, and in the last 30 days, there were 18.8 K transactions involving unique addresses in the SAND asset. This data indicates that the number of people who are involved in using and trading the SAND is decreasing. As a result, the demand and value for the Sandbox price may also be decreasing due to the decreasing number of active addresses over time. These terms are used to highlight the short-term and long-term trends of SAND crypto\u2019s activity and its adoption.

This creates very few jobs or economic opportunities, she added. Per the ministry\u2019s statement, the legislative amendment would allow the government to prohibit or limit electricity usage for crypto miners. This is because the \u201cunchecked growth\u201d of the sector could make it expensive to supply electricity to homes and businesses. In December 2022, the province has called for a suspension of new electricity connections for cryptocurrency mining for 18 months. That said, around 21 projects were temporarily suspended, which had requested total of 11,700 gigawatt hours of power per year. According to a local report, minister Osborne noted that the province is working with British Colombia Hydro, the provincial power utility, to ensure there is enough electricity for the province\u2019s future. \u201cThat includes regulating electricity service for energy-intensive cryptocurrency miners that create very few local jobs.\u201d In February, a provincial supreme court ruled in favor of BC Hydro\u2019s moratorium on crypto mining projects as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 British Columbia Seeks to Preserve Electricity In December 2022, BC province became the third in Canada to impose restrictions on crypto mining after Quebec and Manitoba. BC noted that it will not approve new mining connections to its power grid for 18 months. Osborne noted at the time that the provision is seeking to preserve electricity. Mainly for \u201celectric vehicles and heat pumps, and for businesses and industries that are undertaking electrification projects that reduce carbon emissions and generate jobs and economic opportunities.\u201d BC is the fourth largest producer of electricity in Canada, having estimated generating capacity of 18 250 megawatts (MW). However, a report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation stated that B.C. is a risk to generating enough power consistently in the future. The report said by 2026 that increasing demand and generation constraints could become an issue.

Crypto exchanges that failed to submit license applications are required to discontinue services by May. Weng recently told the Financial Times that HashKey\u2019s decision to launch a Bermuda-licensed exchange this week was partly due to concerns that Hong Kong\u2019s new regulations might restrict access for international investors. He said they create significant barriers for \u201ca lot of global users\u201d seeking to participate in the Hong Kong market. He further cautioned that issuing an excessive number of licenses could be detrimental to Hong Kong, considering the limited size of its domestic market. China Ties Cast Shadow on Hong Kong\u2019s Crypto Future HashKey currently holds one of only two licenses granted for digital asset exchanges in Hong Kong. The other licensed exchange, OSL, recently completed a sale of nearly 30% of its stake to BGX. While details remain unclear, sources familiar with the deal reportedly described BGX as an unlicensed cryptocurrency group with ties to China. These developments have cast doubt on the long-term sustainability of operating under Hong Kong\u2019s current regulatory framework for crypto exchanges, despite continued interest from new companies seeking to enter one of the world\u2019s most dynamic crypto trading markets. Too Stringent for Global Investors? The current regulations restrict exchange clientele to individuals who pass know-your-customer (KYC) checks. They must also possess funds within a local bank account or accounts held in a limited selection of approved overseas jurisdictions. According to Weng, these regulations require revision in order to include a broader spectrum of international investors. He argued that without such modifications, the market would struggle to sustain even a fraction of the initial 24 applicants, potentially limiting viability to as few as four licensed exchanges.

Shiba Inu remains one of the leading crypto meme coins, second in market cap only to Dogecoin. The Ethereum blockchain-issued meme coin first emerged in 2021 as an alternative to Dogecoin. At its market cap peak above $40 billion in late 2021, it even managed to briefly surpass Dogecoin. While SHIB might be 40% down from recent highs, it\u2019s still 3x above its mid-February levels. Its market cap has recovered to a monstrous $16.2 billion. That suggests the scope for further gains is somewhat limited. Sure, Shiba Inu could still 5x or more this bull market. But many meme coin investors will be targeting higher upside, of 1,000%, or 20x or more. Such investors should search for exciting new meme coins with much lower market caps, and a lot of viral potential. A meme coin called Sponge ($SPONGE) fits this bill perfectly. After the original Sponge token nearly hit a market cap high of $100 million last year, $SPONGE has since relaunched on the Polygon blockchain. Polygon has much lower trading fees and faster transactions than Ethereum, where Sponge was originally issued. And the migration breathed a new lease of life into the meme coin. Exciting New Meme Coin Sponge (SPONGE) has fallen back 50% since its recent highs, offering investors a compelling opportunity to buy the dip / Source: DEXTools $SPONGE hit a market cap of as much as $160 million in March. It\u2019s since fallen back to a market cap of around $80 million, offering investors the chance to buy the dip.

While substantially riskier than the spot markets for major cryptos, on-chain markets offer the possibility of quick gains. Newly launched micro-cap cryptos trading in the on-chain markets routinely post 20-100x gains in as little as one day. That being said, it\u2019s not uncommon for these cryptos to drop 90% or more in one day. In such illiquid markets, a few big buy or sell orders can trigger huge price moves. But on-chain markets carry many more risks beyond their low liquidity and volatility. Indeed, given there is virtually no barrier to a blockchain user launching their own coin, the vast majority of tokens launched each day are scams, pump-and-dumps or rug pulls. In other words, they are a means for scammers to unload their worthless tokens on unsuspecting victims. On-chain micro-cap markets are thus exceedingly risky. It is crucial that traders do their own research before buying any tokens. And even if they feel they understand a token/project well, traders should never invest more than they can afford to lose. Even the most legitimate-looking new projects and tokens can turn out to be scams. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the top crypto gainers today in the Ethereum on-chain markets. Top Crypto Gainers Today RWA-AI (RWA) A just-launched token that claims to sit at the intersection of two major themes in crypto, the tokenization of real-world assets and AI, called RWA-AI (RWA) has pumped hard on Thursday. https://twitter.com/RWA4AI/status/1778405387126865985 Since its launch earlier in the day, its up 6,000%, with a market cap of $688,000. That\u2019s according to DEXScreener, who puts its liquidity at $170,000 and 24-hour trading volumes at $640,000. Go+ Security identifies five concerning aspects to its smart contract however. Traders should be wary that it could be a scam. PondPay (PoP) A shitcoin called PondPay (PoP) is pumping for a second straight day. Today marks a monumental milestone for us. This is the beginning of a new era in the crypto payment world. For the first time ever, you can now access a refund option and send payments with total security, even among anonymous Web3 users, thanks to PondPay. pic.twitter.com/V9TAN05vjO \u2014 PondPay (@pondpay_ai) April 12, 2024 As per DEXScreener, it was last up 567% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $674,000. The token last had liquidity of $358,000 and over $1 million in 24-hour trading volumes. Traders should be careful of this coin. It only has two smart contract issues, as identified by Go+ Security. But there are spelling errors in its bio on DEXScreener. Moreover, of the 8 votes that DEXScreener users have left regarding the coin, 5 are red flags. Clearly there isn\u2019t much trust that this coin has any real utility. Parobot (PARO) A new shitcoin called Parobot (PARO) is up 356% one day after launch as per DEXScreener. The token last had a market cap of $322,000, with $260,000 in locked liquidity and $1.9 million in 24-hour volumes. Traders should be cautious of the token. Go+ Security shows that token transfers are pausable and that there is a 4-5% buy/sell tax. Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy. An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower. A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales. The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price. These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing. While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales\u2014unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision\u2014savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more. With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market. Here are 17 of the presale projects with the highest potential.

(Edited, based on work by Uwe Dedering [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Novosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia. Along with Irkutsk, almost 2,000km to the east, it has become a major hub for Russia\u2019s fast-growing crypto mining industry. However, power providers have complained of a rapid rise in \u201cillegal\u201d crypto mining. By this, they mean crypto miners who use illegal connections to the power network to steal electricity. Novosibirsk police officers said they had completely shut down \u201cthe work\u201d of all four \u201ccrypto farms at once\u201d in simultaneous raids. Crypto Mining Farms Found All Around City, Police Say Police raided facilities near a wastewater treatment plant. They also swooped on a center in a forest on the outskirts of the Leninsky District. Another farm was operating near \u201ca city landfill on the left bank\u201d of the River Ob. One more was found in a \u201cprivate sector\u201d area in the Kalininsky District. All four mining farms \u201cwere equipped with modern power equipment,\u201d energy company officials said. But none of the centers were using \u201clegal connections\u201d to power grids, Rosseti explained. A spokesperson added: \u201cThe operators carried out electricity theft on an industrial scale.\u201d Officials said they had pressed charges, and noted that the operators could face jail time if convicted.

Officials said at the time that the miners had stolen \u201cseveral million rubles\u201d worth of power from the grid.

In 2023, meanwhile, Rosseti and local police shut down 17 \u201cillegal mining farms\u201d in the cities of Krasnoyarsk, Omsk, and Khakassia. Further raids were carried out in the Krasnoyarsk Territory and Khakassia, as well as the Omsk Oblast.

The fate of the industrial mining industry is yet to be determined in Moscow, where miners claim that they want to pay tax on their income.

Traders continue to monitor themes including the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the evolving Fed interest rate outlook, and Bitcoin ETF flows. Bitcoin swung in the $70,000-71,000 area on Thursday, and may be the best crypto to buy now, given its potential to hit $100,000 this year. / Source: TradingView The halving is now just nine days away as nerves are building that Bitcoin could see price turbulence. Meanwhile, fading GBTC outflows means spot Bitcoin ETF demand is returning as a tailwind to the market. That is helping to cushion the BTC price against a recent repricing of Fed rate cut bets. Wednesday\u2019s hot US CPI data, which comes on the heels of strong jobs and activity data a week earlier, suggests that it will be too early for the Fed to cut interest rates this summer. Whilst the timing of US rate cuts are being pushed back, the long-term trajectory remains towards easing. New York Fed President John Williams reiterated his stance that rate cuts make sense later this year. Globally, other major central banks are also easing. The ECB signaled rate cuts to come this summer at its Thursday meeting. Macro thus looks set to remain a long-term tailwind for Bitcoin and the broader market. Indeed, many continue to bet that BTC can hit $100,000 this year. That suggests, for investors looking to get involved in crypto, it could be the best crypto to buy today. It is, after all, the oldest, most time-tested and trusted crypto asset on the market. The 9 Bitcoin ETFs have purchased ~225,000 #Bitcoin since the launch in January.

AI remains a big narrative in the market right now. But it\u2019s still small market cap of currently around $4.1 billion leaves plenty of room for upside. After all, AI companies like Nvidia have valuations to the north of $1 trillion. Helium (HNT) DePIN project Helium (HNT), a network that leverages a decentralized global network of wireless hotspot providers and double up as miners, is pumping on Thursday. As per CoinMarketCap, HNT was last up around 10% in 24 hours and trading close to $6.10. HNT\u2019s market cap was last around $980 million. For believers in the project\u2019s long-term vision, this is still a bargain valuation. Bulls will be hoping Thursday\u2019s strong performance is the start of a push back to 2024 highs around $11.0. NEO (NEO) Neo (NEO), the cryptocurrency of the up-and-coming smart contract blockchain NEO, is pumping on Thursday. According to CoinMarketCap, it was last up 10% in the past 24 hours at $21.87 per token. That rally has lifted its market cap to around $1.54 billion. That\u2019s a very modest market cap still if the blockchain does see some decent real-world adoption. NEO could easily still 5x this bull market, making it a candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains. But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in crypto presales. Presales allow investors the opportunity to buy tokens of upstart crypto projects at early-bord prices. These projects then put these funds to powering the development of their protocols. There is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors. Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform. If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good. The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out. Here is a list of 17 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2024.

In an April 10 Twitter thread reviewing the protocol\u2019s mechanics, Fusaro noted that USDe \u201cmay be the fastest-growing USD-denominated asset in the history of crypto.\u201d Bitwise Examines Ethena (USDe) \u201cUSDe operates v similarly to an ETF,\u201d he wrote.

Those reserves are counterbalanced by equally weighted short perpetual futures exposure, creating a \u201cdelta neutral\u201d portfolio that maintains the same dollar-denominated value over time. But there\u2019s a catch: The reserves generate yield through their staked ETH and futures interest\u2014and that yield is paid out to all holders of USDe. Then, holders can stake their USDe themselves to receive sUSDe and receive even more yield. \u201cAt scale, this interest can be massive.\u201d Fusaro wrote. \u201cIt is a gargantuan total addressable market.\u201d USDe Versus Other Stablecoins By comparison, traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by centralized reserves primarily consisting of cash and U.S. Treasury bills. The T-bills produce a hefty profit, but the companies backing them entirely retain their gains and do not distribute them to stablecoin holders. USDe still carries unique risks like any other asset, however. According to Fusaro, these include exchange counterparty risk, exchange hacking risk, smart contract risk, and the risk that futures funding will go negative. Nevertheless, if the stablecoin experiences any depegs or radical unwinds, Fusaro says it won\u2019t be in the same fashion as the Terra protocol\u2019s TerraUSD stablecoin in May 2022. TerraUSD collapsed in a downward spiral alongside the network\u2019s LUNA token due to internal algorithms that caused the latter token\u2019s supply to hyperinflate. \u201cIs [USDe] going to work? Honestly, I do not know,\u201d wrote Fusaro. \u201cBut the rapid growth and immediate success are wild and the support that they have is obviously significant.\u201d USDe now boasts a $2.36 billion market cap, compared to less than $1 billion exactly one month ago.

Sam Bankman-Fried Formally Files FTX Trial Appeal In the court filing, lawyers for Bankman-Fried formally filed to appeal his 25-year prison sentence following the FTX fraudster\u2019s grueling landmark fraud trial last fall. Meanwhile, in an additional court filing, attorneys for the FTX founder requested that Judge Lewis A. Kaplan keep Bankman-Fried at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to \u201cfacilitate access to his appellate counsel\u201d as he works to overturn his sentence. In addition to SBF\u2019s 25-year prison sentence, Judge Kaplan, who originally suggested that the former \u201cking of crypto\u201d could be placed in a medium-security prison in his home state of California, ordered Bankman-Fried to pay an estimated $11 billion forfeiture. Following his guilty verdict in November 2023, Bankman-Fried vowed to \u201cvigorously\u201d fight the charges brought against him. The Worst Prison In The USA?

Named after Elon Musk\u2019s Shiba Inu dog, Floki is the fifth-largest meme coin by market capitalization. According to CoinMarketCap, the FLOKI market cap was last around $1.84 billion. A surge in risk appetite in the meme coin sector saw FLOKI post explosive price growth in late February/early March. Between February 25 and March 14, FLOKI pumped as much as 800%, reaching an all-time high of $0.000313. But it has since dropped back by around 38%. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have been consolidating since early March. This comes as spot Bitcoin ETF optimism fades, as traders digest the news of the SEC investigating the Ethereum Foundation, Fed rate cut bets are pared, and amid profit-taking ahead of the Bitcoin halving. This loss of momentum in the broader market has caused the meme coin space risk appetite to deflate. As the deflation continues, Floki\u2019s price drop could be about to go from bad to worse, however. Floki Price Prediction \u2013 Is A Sharp Drop Incoming? In the last month, the Floki price has been consolidating within a triangular pennant structure. Floki is currently threatening to break this pennant structure to the downside. If it does, a short-term retest of $0.00016 support would be on the cards. A break below here could be when things could get scary. Floki has no major support levels until $0.00007. So that means losses of potentially as much as 65% from current levels could be on the cards. For investors who bought at the recent high, that could mean losses of as much as 80%. The Floki Inu Price is at risk of seeing a sharp decline in the coming sessions should these key levels break. Source: TradingView Of course, many would consider such a dip a great time to add exposure to the meme coin sector. The last few months have shown that meme coins continue to have huge potential. Floki could yet hit fresh record highs with this bull market far from over. That\u2019s even though near-term price risks are tilted to the downside. High Potential Floki Alternative to Consider \u2013 5thScape Floki could deliver big gains during the ongoing but bumpy crypto bull market. But its upside from here may be limited to as little as 5-10x. And many crypto investors looking to up their risk profile will be looking to lock in bigger gains. One often overlooked crypto investing strategy is to invest in cryptocurrency presales. Web3 projects and protocols often sell their tokens at big discount prices to early investors to raise funds for development. If the project gains traction in the market, these early bird investors are often then able to sell their tokens for big gains. And although presales can be riskier than investing in established cryptocurrencies, historical data indicates they can also yield substantial gains for those who successfully identify promising ones. Projects with strong leadership, clear objectives, and the potential to disrupt the cryptocurrency space may offer a big upside. Which is why the Cryptonews team provides resources and analysis to identify the most compelling presales within the cryptocurrency sector, offering investors a place to start. One such presale they think has a lot of potential right now is 5thScape (5SCAPE). The 5SCAPE project is the world\u2019s first VR/AR mixed-reality platform, with a lot of potential to ride the XR narrative wave. Our presale has surged past stage 3! Join us now and delve into a world of virtual reality with our multi-utility token.

Priced at just $0.00285, a steep discount versus the token\u2019s planned launch price of $0.01, investors who get involved now can lock in paper gains of 250%. The project has already raised a whopping $4.9 million. Given its total token supply of 5.1 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $15 million. 5thScape could easily become a major market leader in its VR/AR niche. There is a good chance that it could one day become a $500 million market cap token. That means investors who get in now could potentially lock in gains in the region of 30x. 5thScape was audited by Coinsult as well, and no major issues were found with its code. Also, the project is fully KYC\u2019d by SolidProof; the team passed the KYC verification process on January 3, 2024.

The $SLOTH ICO has only been going for three weeks and it has already raised an eye-watering $10 million, The news comes after established Solana meme coins like Slerf, DogWifHat and Bonk have followed (and on some days, outpaced) market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum in small market-wide rallies off ahead of Bitcoin\u2018s (BTC) halving next week. Ethereum\u2019s high-functionality smart contracts made it the network of choice for meme coin projects for a long time.

The halving is an event in Bitcoin\u2019s code that slashes BTC mining rewards in half. Since miners control the issuance of new Bitcoin, this drive the price up as the bottlenecked supply struggles to meet the heightened institutional demand resulting from the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US back in January, along with heightened retail and institutional demand from the halving itself. The following month, on May 23, 2024, the SEC must deliver a verdict on a round of spot Ethereum NFTs. Again, given the historical precedent with Bitcoin, the industry sees US spot Ethereum ETF hype as a strong potential price driver across the market, particularly on a chain like Solana which outperforms Ethereum for speed and scale.

Price movements in the last fortnight suggest the token could find support at its present level, although with Bitcoin\u2019s halving dropping in the middle of the month, NEAR Protocol could very well climb another leg higher. The Halving Is Near All crypto fans are looking forward to the Bitcoin halving on April 20, because historically the quadrennial event has led to market-wide bull runs. That\u2019s the date when Bitcoin mining rewards get cut in half, bottlenecking the issuance of new Bitcoin at a time when spot market ETFs have created new institutional demand and driven the asset to exceed its performance during its 2021 bull run. There have only been three halvings since Bitcoin launched in 2009, but a pattern has emerged: halvings have always preceded bull runs. At today\u2019s price of over $70k, the world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency has outdone its seminal 2021 bull run and fans are eager to set a new high watermark this year. They believe the halving will set off a potent mix of industry FOMO and optimism that will attract many investors in the coming months. Some more blockchain savvy than others. A new incentivized crypto learning platform has dropped today that hopes to fill in the gaps in public knowledge while flaunting an innovative new learn-to-earn model that will no doubt tempt copycats. Well, 99Bitcoins is not exactly new. Established in 2013 as BitcoinWithPayPal, the site initially featured high-quality primers on purchasing Bitcoin through PayPal. After landing in hot water with PayPal, the site rebranded. Today, as the team begins a presale for the platform\u2019s native $99BTC token, it brings a long-established community of 700,000 YouTube subscribers, alongside 2 million registered users for its crypto courses. Those who progress through the courses, or actively participate in the community, will earn $99BTC directly in their Ethereum wallet. Holders can redeem tokens for exclusive access to premium content, discounts on partner products and services, and token holder events. Interested in the on-chain future of education?

In an announcement, Chainlink said the application is built using its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) \u2013 the standard for cross-chain interoperability. The firm went on to describe the new Transporter application as a \u201chyper-secure bridging Aapp\u201d \u2014 explaining it is built on Chainlink CCIP to bring \u201cunprecedented security\u201d to users wanting to transfer tokens across blockchains. App Allows Users to Transfer Various Tokens The Transporter app allows users to transfer tokens across a variety of blockchains, starting with Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and WEMIX. \u201cTransporter makes it easier to utilize the security benefits of Chainlink CCIP for the transfer of large token value and critical messages across chains,\u201d said Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink in a press release. \u201cHaving a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years and I\u2019m excited that Transporter is making that more accessible,\u201d said Nazarov. Chainlink said it has also unveiled a new token transfer mechanism for CCIP, which allows native ETH to be transferred cross-chain through WETH token pools. \u201cThis marks the first instance of a lock and unlock mechanism being implemented in CCIP,\u201d said the firm. Transporter Allows Users to Track Assets According to Chainlink, the Transporter application is built to give users complete peace of mind by offering an intuitive UI, and 24/7 global support. The application has a visual tracker that provides real-time visibility into the state of their cross-chain transactions. Transporter allows users to track their assets and messages at every step of the transaction, both on the Transporter app and through the Chainlink CCIP Explorer. No Fees Chainlink said the new application doesn\u2019t charge additional fees, just the regular fees for using CCIP, which cover the gas costs of completing transactions on the destination chain and the fees paid to CCIP service providers.

Inflation refers to the prolonged increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time, usually resulting in a decline in the purchasing power of fiat currency. In March, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) statistics exceeded expectations. Inflation grew by 0.4% month-on-month and 3.5% year-on-year. This was in contrast to the Dow Jones economists\u2019 survey estimates, which predicted a 0.3% month-on-month and 3.4% year-on-year growth. This difference was mainly influenced by increases in the cost of shelter and fuel, as shown in a report released by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics. Interest rate increases are used as a tool to reduce inflation by slowing economic activity, lowering consumer spending and business investment, strengthening the currency, and altering expectations about future inflation. These impacts combine to reduce inflationary pressures in the economy. Therefore, this unexpected increase in inflation has lowered the confidence in the possibility of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in the coming months. According to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool, at the time of writing traders estimate the probability of a June rate decrease at only 20.6%, compared to 45.9% for September. This indicates that market analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to hold interest rates constant in May and June, with the first likely rate cut coming in September. This prolongs the economy\u2019s slowed state, resulting in less volume flowing into assets like Bitcoin and investors decreasing their position. As evidenced by Bitcoin\u2019s price action on April 10th, which fell by 2.5% in response to the unexpected CPI figures. Although, correcting later that day. In the past, the 10-year real interest rate spiked, and Bitcoin\u2019s price fell dramatically in correlation. From December 2017 to January 2018, the 10-year real interest rate surged from 0.573 to 0.873, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. During which, Bitcoin experienced a 28% decline. Grayscale \u2013 Inflation Is In Crypto\u2019s Favour Grayscale\u2019s managing director of research, Zach Pandl argued in favour of the current negative market sentiment, admitting rising inflation to be a \u201cshort-term negative for crypto,\u201d with high inflation \u201cThe [Federal Reserve] is unlikely to cut rates for a while.\u201d Instead, he cited events like the Bitcoin halving, rising economic growth, and growing crypto adoption as factors that will drive Bitcoin\u2019s price, stating: \u201cBitcoin halving and adoption trends like tokenization should create a supportive environment for crypto markets.\u201d Pandle\u2019s opinion, on the other hand, was based on the belief that cryptocurrency will see long-term benefits from increased interest rates. As inflation rates continue to rise and fiat currency becomes devalued, store-of-value assets such as Bitcoin will continue to be a \u201chot commodity as the United States government continues to overspend and keep interest rates high,\u201c Pendl claims. However, this is not without its doubts. Although Bitcoin has consistently proven to be a successful long-term store of value since its launch in 2010, its high volatility makes it an unpredictable investment, with many long periods in the red. Therefore, investors may gravitate toward less volatile assets, such as conventional bonds and term deposits.

Ditobanx, on the other hand, will handle the tokenization and structuring of the transaction, ensuring issuance on the Liquid blockchain\u2014a Bitcoin layer-2 solution. Announced on April 11, HILSV represents the first of its kind in the region, seeking to raise $6.25 million. The tokenized debt issuance will offer a 10% coupon over a five-year period, with a minimum investment threshold of $1,000. The issuance will be facilitated by Inversiones Laguardia S.A. de C.V. The funds raised will be used to develop the 4,484-square-meter hotel complex, which features 80 rooms, five commercial spaces, a swimming pool, restaurants, and various amenities spread across five levels. It\u2019s important to note that while Hilton Hotels is involved as a franchisor, it does not endorse any offering and bears no responsibility, according to the press release. Despite Hilton\u2019s involvement limited to that of a franchisor, the initiative is poised to create significant economic opportunities. The project is expected to generate around 1,000 jobs during construction and up to 5,000 direct and indirect jobs once operational. \u201cThe HILSV token marks the first digital asset tokenization from El Salvador and represents an important step forward in developing its nascent capital market as well as introducing a major new asset class into the market,\u201d Bitfinex Securities CTO Paolo Ardoinio said in a statement.

Laguardia stated that this will in turn enable the development of vital tourism-related infrastructure, ultimately fueling economic growth and benefiting every Salvadoran citizen. Bitfinex Securities Granted First License for Operation in El Salvador In January, Bitfinex Securities made history by becoming the inaugural regulated entity to obtain a license for operation in El Salvador under the nation\u2019s recently enacted Digital Asset Securities Law. This landmark development comes amidst growing anticipation for regulated investment avenues, particularly in the wake of the successful introduction of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Upon receiving the license, the tokenized securities platform wasted no time and immediately began accepting customer applications. Furthermore, it announced the establishment of a robust pipeline comprising potential financial asset issuances slated to debut in the first half of this year. This initiative follows the success of a tokenized bond offering by Alternative via Bitfinex Securities AIFC in Kazakhstan in November, which raised over $5.2 million in USDT on the Liquid Network. To access all Bitfinex Securities issuances, customers must be verified with both its Kazakhstan and El Salvador entities. El Salvador has been at the forefront of crypto adoption, granting Bitcoin legal tender status in 2021 and launching the \u201cAdopting El Salvador Freedom Visa\u201d program in collaboration with stablecoin issuer Tether.

Speaking at a regulatory panel discussion during the Paris Blockchain Week, White acknowledged the imperfections in crypto regulations and emphasized the need for improvement. VARA CEO Advocates for Innovative Solutions to Regulatory Compliance Challenges White acknowledged the high costs associated with regulatory compliance, particularly for smaller crypto entities with limited resources. He emphasized the importance of finding solutions to address this issue. To address these concerns, he stated VARA\u2019s extensive engagement with industry stakeholders, including global players and government officials, to develop regulations that accommodate the diverse needs of the crypto community. White proposed potential solutions, such as larger market participants hosting smaller ones to share compliance burdens. He stressed the importance of fostering innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at structures whereby larger market participants host smaller ones, so the cost of compliance is borne by these larger players,\u201d he explained. This arrangement would allow smaller players to enter the regulated ecosystem without shouldering the same level of compliance costs as larger players. The VARA CEO highlighted VARA\u2019s primary objective, stating, \u201cWhat VAR aims to do is to\u2026 balance innovation with regulation; that is the end goal.\u201d He stated that the crypto ecosystem in Dubai boasts nearly 2,000 web3 or crypto companies and the importance of not disrupting it with regulatory measures. White outlined VARA\u2019s inclusive approach to regulation, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not an exclusive [regulation]\u2026 anybody can be part of it.\u201d White also emphasized the role of regulatory certainty in attracting investment and enabling organizations to grow and scale. He noted that while regulatory frameworks can be challenging to navigate, they ultimately contribute to the industry\u2019s maturity and facilitate long-term planning for businesses. VARA CEO Matthew White Discusses Future of Crypto Regulation in Dubai The Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) was established in March 2022 with the mandate to oversee and cultivate the Web3 ecosystem in Dubai. Less than a year later, in February 2023, VARA unveiled comprehensive regulatory guidelines tailored for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). These guidelines encompass four mandatory rulebooks, along with seven activity-specific rulebooks delineating operational protocols for VASPs, as well as a rulebook for virtual asset issuance. In November of the same year, Matthew White assumed the role of CEO at VARA, succeeding former CEO Henson Orser. VARA announced White\u2019s appointment on November 16 as part of its preparations to transition to full-scale market operations. White\u2019s appointment came amidst a backdrop of tightened regulations in the United Arab Emirates, including penalties for unlicensed virtual asset service providers. During the panel discussion, White discussed the future of regulation in the crypto industry, acknowledging the inevitability of significant regulations in the short to medium term and citing recent high-profile events as driving forces behind major countries\u2019 efforts to intensify regulatory agendas. Despite the imminent regulatory landscape, he expressed optimism about leveraging technology to achieve policy objectives in the long term. White hinted at the possibility of exploring technological solutions through pilot programs at VARA, aligning with the authority\u2019s philosophy. \u201cI do think we can look to technology to achieve the policy objectives that we set out to achieve\u2026 maybe we\u2019ll have a little pilot\u2026 in VARA\u2026 that\u2019s what we set out to do.\u201d The post Dubai\u2019s VARA Aims to Facilitate Smaller Crypto Entities, Acknowledges Imperfections in Regulations appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"Matthew White, CEO of Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), expressed the watchdog's commitment to easing the regulatory burden for smaller cryptocurrency entities.

While some have warned that the halving will result in a dip in the shorter term, it\u2019s likely to be bullish overall, with the wider market benefitting from BTC\u2019s growth. This will include Dogecoin, which later in the year could potentially benefit from its own news. Namely, we may eventually see X follow through with its plans to roll out digital payments on its social network, payments which may include crypto. And if they do include crypto \u2013 and DOGE \u2013 then the Dogecoin price could rally massively.

New Dogecoins for New Market-Beating Rallies Dogecoin is such a well-established alt now that it may not experience any really big rallies this year (unless DOGE payments come to X). As such, traders looking for outsized returns will probably have to search elsewhere, potentially in the area of newer meme tokens and presale coins. One example that is both a meme token and a presale coin is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme token that has raised over $1.7 million in its sale.

Enhancements Across the Board The new Mac release will replace iMacs, updated 14-inch MacBook Pros with 14-inch and low-end 16-inch MacBook Pros, and a refreshed Mac minis. These concessions take place at a moment when the PC business experienced a fall following the soaring demand after the crisis years. The M4 processors by Apple are made for directed and AI features that can complete laborious tasks by themselves, including those that involve document summation, cloud computing is not necessarily needed. Industry giants, including Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, have their versions of AI-enabled chips ready for release in the future. Such a development might signify a major revolution in the hardware consumer arena where AI will start being integrated with separate appliances and machines. Industry context and Apple\u2019s strategy The implementation of M4 chips is related to the more significant sectorial trend in which the primary manufacturers in the industry are all diversifying into AI intelligence capabilities. The consensus will catalyze the PC industry which has gone through a downturn desperately since the Covid-19 crisis. Apple saw Apple\u2019s strategy to supply all Macs with the new AI-oriented chip design as the choice that could keep its competitive position and satisfy the need for more powerful personal computers integrated with AI. The news that M4 chips are being developed arrived earlier at the upcoming developers conference organized by Apple in June when the company is meant to discuss new AI partnerships and larger changes to both its operating systems, Mac OS and iPhone OS. With AI, the company chiefly identifies innovations and nonetheless shows the versatility of AI in creating a great user experience on all of its devices.

This revision is even more relevant as Apple\u2019s sales in their most recent fiscal year, which is from September to now, have been reportedly declining by 27%; they also reported a fall in the number of new Mac laptops and desktops that they sent to customers. The M4, and the AI functions, which are already there to inward this downsizing phenomenon begin to operate. Users can anticipate gadgets that are not only swifter in speed but also intellectually flexible, things that surpass what commonly known computing devices can do.

Jassy, who replaced Bezos in the mid- of 2021, outlined a plan to remain agile in operations while at the same time finding growth opportunities. Jassy emphasized the fact that Amazon is just as concerned about optimizing operational costs as it is about providing customers with outstanding services and remaining financially prudent. Following significant layoffs in 2022 and 2023, Amazon again continues to strengthen it\u2019s operational functions, specifically in the retail business, to reach efficiency and superiority. AI as a strategic focus Jassy stated artificial intelligence to be the focal point of future growth of Amazon, and for that the firm is proceeding in developing \u201cprimitive services\u201d that are the foundation blocks of innovation and propects for new starts. The success of AWS, and Amazon Web Services, as the core of Amazon\u2019s successful diversification, explained the CEO\u2019s convictions to see AI as the next major business area. Jassy highlighted AWS as a connector in AI craftsmanship, and he redefined the role of the cloud computing division as a critical player in the forming of the contemporary AI world. AI is a game changer across industries. Tech giants like AWS aim to be enabling partners who will power the most innovative applications and services. Thus, AWS\u2019 secure and scalable cloud will contribute to the future success of the industry and help to consolidate AWS\u2019s position as a market leader. Strategic partnerships and investments To round up its roster of AI completeness, Amazon recently brought AI luminary Andrew Ng onto its board. Ng\u2019s knowledge and experience will bolster Amazon\u2019s. Amazon has also invested heavily in an AI startup, Anthropic, to enable their scientists and researchers to develop AI solutions in the Amazon ecosystem. Some other recent Amazon forays in the AI space include launching Rufus, an AI-powered tool designed to assist in improving the shopping experience by aiding customers in searching and finding products more easily. Those efforts join a host of other Amazon AI integrations, ranging from workplace-oriented business tasks with \u201cQ,\u201d an AI chatbot, to Bedrock, a generative AI service for AWS customers.

Moreover, Reviewing the tremendous positive outcomes that rose from the recent quarter can make them see much more possibility of expectation due to the remarkable healing of their revenue. If the second and third sectors are to be included, introducing the machine learning component to the functionality of machines in these fields comes accordingly. People\u2019s future existence can be said to be similar to robotics. Therefore, a very fast increase in AI application usage among people will be revealed, and perhaps this can be for more than necessary and subversively. There is one issue we are sure you will be very familiar with, but we see that it is still the most important problem of government aid toward the end of 2023, and everything seems to continue for a long time in 2023-2024. Dell\u2019s efficiency drive: Reducing AI GPU delivery times by 50% An estimation of \u201cDell\u2019s shares \u201d in the best-selling along with Nvidia\u201d could also be considered, which would mean that the chance of getting a profit return from the market will increase indirectly. Liao Renxiang Limited, as a two-year-old brand, therefore had to significantly reduce the stock by 50 % or maybe more because electronic companies in the US have enforced restrictions on the delivery of certain components. This sort of promise and sensibility is apparent from Dell Taiwan Co. and its CEO, whose declaration of reducing computer parts by half to assemble the new AI epicenter server tries to reflect this commitment. So, to sum up, in such a way, the dispute, which fortunately had a curtain fall, pursued the same task as this paradigm, a product that overlapped and today or in the foreseeable future completely replaced the Nvidia technology. Last but not least, depending on the market situation specific to different market segments is also something that needs to be addressed, such as the server market for small and medium-sized enterprises worldwide, where Dell possesses a 24.5% market share as shown in the Economic Daily News in Taiwan, July 2018. The system worked the same way as before, and it shared the same features even though the previous systems took 40 weeks while the new one took 2 months to complete. However, it can buy out non-gaming companies under the same umbrella as Seasons Covers for Gaming range, which is geared towards gaming. After having their wages increase by nearly three to four times more than before, some consumers will crave more novelty than they were aware of when purchasing cassettes, and that`s why market satisfaction can be predicted positively. That world keeps this chain on them, a big puzzle for them as they cannot help it. So, their pals take them to a store with more sweets, but that will still not solve a sweet needs issue. TSMC is a crucial dispatch center in the world semiconductor sector and is the rising star propelling other regional industries. Objectively, various conditions are rampant in the TSMF segment, and one of them, Taiwan Semiconductor, is one of the most used. Fueling competition in the AI chip market Joining the discourse on one of the issues now, the Chinese administration, simultaneously resolving some issues for Dell and some others, creates conditions for Dell and his partners, delivering projects just in time. As the previous examples have shown, these companies have played a critical role in AI promotions: NVIDIA, emphasizing photo-realism, led that trend. Preynatics are no longer consumers; they are now involved in designing and implementing AI solutions\u2014from data centers to product lines (data center and inference solutions for RTX 5000 products, which have dedicated ray-tracing engines and a future market-capturing aim).

The app is developed in partnership with the Howe Innovation Center, which has Universal Design as a core value encompassing both the Perkins School for the Blind and the institute and uses advanced AI technologies to give passengers audio descriptions denoting the outside scenery in real-time. Enhancing accessibility through technology The Honda Audio app through the utilization of a combination of computer vision, generative AI, satellite imaging, geo-targeting, and weather data can narrate the surroundings when the car windows are down. This technology brings the opportunity for an in-depth description of the surroundings, cities, and scenes that deliver the perfect experience of traveling for the visually impaired and the blind passengers in particular. The app consists of elements labeled with heights, temperature, and sounds, which all come as conveyors of life. It would not matter how far the person is away from the outside world since the app has already made a replacement for it, bringing life to the sound itself. As a Senior Manager of Honda, Phil Hruska shared with the audience the company\u2019s desire to apply technology that can enhance the pleasure and freedom of usage of the product for all customers. \u201cThe scenic audio app of Honda will create a continuous robot voice description of the roadside views during the process of driving beautiful cars that catalyzed the widening of visions and boosting of joyful feelings in the heart of blind car passengers,\u201d Hruska said. A literary approach to scenic narratives There is more to the app than just a simple listing of the elements of the setting. It crafts literary stories that have a tone that is more suited to this type of narrative. This strategy focuses on the use of descriptive expressions and the creation of a one-of-a-kind color pallet that brings the surroundings into focus. Through this method, they attempt to create a space where users who cannot witness the escape can still take part in the experience and have a much more vivid sensory journey. Our work with the Howe Innovation Center has been valuable in customizing the app\u2019s features to ensure that visually impaired people have all their needs addressed. Such partnership is a run-up of an initial idea for both Honda and the Perkins School for the Blind to apply technology more inclusively. Future directions and impact The new technology of the Honda Scenic Audio app has been set, in a sense, inspiring the automobile industry in relation to the accessing criteria. Additionally, it indicates AI and similar types of technologies that can be deployed to break the barriers and to create an inclusive environment. As technology becomes more advanced, it may not be the only use of it in the mobility area, further enabling people with visual impairments to turn their world into a more accessible place. The app release is a part of the broad program implemented by Honda under its statement \u201cDreams are Power\u201d where it intends to promote comfortable amenities and freedom by means of innovatory remedies.

He has been working out to build a global coalition of government and tech industry leading figures to boost support for artificial intelligence technology. People familiar with the developments have highlighted Altman\u2019s intention of convincing governments around the globe for taking measures of increasing computer chip production facilities, increasing data centers capacity, and raising energy production to meet AI requirements. Sam Altman on his visit to the UAE In his spree to persuade governments, Altman visited the United Arab Emirates this week and met government officials and deep pocketed investors to discuss ways on how the private sector and governments can work together to facilitate artificial intelligence projects, as these projects are extremely costly and require enormous resources. Before the UAE, Altman has also visited different western countries and talked to various officials on the same subjects. Altman also supposedly met Martina Strong, who is the US ambassador to the UAE. Visiting the UAE is not surprising due to the fact that Dubai has shown excellent improvement in technology advancement over the past years, and there are sufficient reasons to gain attention from Altman, as it now stands near Switzerland in terms of innovation and technology, as Dubai now scores 8.7 out of 10. In terms of technology, it ranks third globally after Switzerland and Singapore, surpassing Hong Kong. On the regulatory side, the UAE is among the first states to introduce regulations regarding virtual assets. Source: Statista UAE is the second largest economy of the Arab world and is continuously diversifying its resources from an oil based economy to tourism and now fintech. During the fourth quarter of previous fiscal year UAE\u2019s economy observed a growth of 8%, and UAE\u2019s economy is expected for a robust improvement according to a report of UAE,s central bank. Later this week, Altman is expected to visit Washington to meet US officials, taking them onboard and likely convincing them for their support. It is not clear what the outcomes may be of these efforts, but Altman seems determined to pursuing his goals. Such efforts have not been seen before from any private company\u2019s head for artificial intelligence advancements, and it shows Sam Altman\u2019s interest in fulfilling the requirements, as it is expected that the current infrastructure and current supply of silicon chips will not be able to keep up with the demands in the near future. As we know, there is already a supply gap in computer chip supply, and it will increase with an increase in demand, so building infrastructure is crucial. What is the need for a Global AI Cabal? Altman is seeking to get funds amounting to billions of dollars from governments and investors alike to build a huge network of silicon chip factories across many countries in order to meet AI demands for semiconductors. But there is an additional layer to Altman\u2019s outreach, as his intentions seem to be more than setting up semiconductor factories. Artificial intelligence is power hungry technology, so he is also interested in energy production initiatives, especially nuclear power, but he is also debating solar options. Altman is a fan of nuclear energy and has supported Oklo, a startup focusing on small modular reactors, and Helion Energy, which is working on fusion technology. Altman has pursued billions of dollars from business giants like Microsoft, Japan\u2019s SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi\u2019s G42, and well as from many others, during the past months-in order to build a number of silicon chip manufacturing factories. But from the overall scenario, it is becoming clear that it is not only about chip factories and supply chains but quite more about energy production, like nuclear installations, and increasing the capacity of giant datacenters and building more of them. But there is a catch, Altman engaging with UAE investor G42 can bring the collaboration under US regulators\u2019 scrutiny because of G42\u2019s ties with Chinese counterparts, which have already brought G42 under investigation. UAE\u2019s G42 has been investing huge cash in AI tech, including supercomputers with Cerebra\u2019s wafer scale GPUs. This project alone is suggested to be a $900 million investment. G42 is said to have trimmed relations with Chinese suppliers to please the US. Altman has been accused of trying to seek $7 trillion for silicon chip manufacturing. Certainly the word \u201ccabal\u201d implies something \u201csinister\u201d but Mr. Altman corrects the misimpression, and denies the claim, calling it internet disinformation. The depth of his targets is still unknown, but sources speculate that his ambitions are practically billions of dollars and may exceed these figures.

Highly qualified coders are expected to have an adoption rate as high as 75%, and this is many times greater than the mere 10% seen at the beginning of 2023. Gartner\u2019s survey of 598 global companies in the third quarter of 2023 revealed a significant trend: 63% of the companies that were undertaking either the trial phase, the phase of adoption, or had completed integration of AI code assistants into their workflows shows how clearly they tend to embrace the technology. Despite initial concerns regarding potential job displacement, analysts highlight a silver lining: improved positive developer experience, greater job satisfaction, and retention among developers. Gartner\u2019s studies indicate that though many organizations consider AI code assistants as tools for accelerating development processes, the tool possesses a large array of benefits that are still unrecognized. One of the approaches to improving the efficiency of the developers would be decreasing context switching, keeping the flow state of the developer, increasing the DX, leveling up the code performance, and minimizing the maintenance, which, as a result, the time-to-market will be improved. Value of AI Code Assistants Major efforts to improve the integrated developer platforms. This week comes with some dramatic AI-empowered code assistants where the major IDEs are introducing the most significant improvements. The release of Gemini for Android Studio and the announcement of Copilot being a part of Visual Studio starting from release 17.10 ensure that Google has achieved two important milestones for AI-assisted development platforms. The upgrades are geared at simplifying the programming workflows and can increase productivity owing to the advanced assistance and training tools. These advancements may end up improving code accuracy, but at the same time, they may put jobs at risk. Balancing efficiency and taking shifting jobs into account Although the use of AI code assistants expedites and simplifies programming as an automated process, it also leads to a problem of people\u2019s job losses. According to the latest information published by the Adecco group, it is possible that there will be fewer vacancies because of generative AI. The fact that companies might benefit from technological advances is not the only concern, and we need to think also about the social and economical impacts on society as a whole, especially when speaking about the unemployment rate and an economy\u2019s general stability. These developments are twofold that is, they not only improve productivity accuracy but, at the same time, also greatly jeopardize job security. Whilst it can have positive influence on the companies, it is advisable to analyze the social and economic implications of technical development, particularly those concerning the unemployment rate and the economic situation as a whole.

Aptos Overview MARKET CAP CIRCULATING SUPPLY ALL-TIME LOW ALL-TIME HIGH POPULARITY $5 billion 398,060,681 $3.09 $19.90 #24 Aptos Price History The Aptos blockchain was developed over the past three years by over 350+ developers across the globe. The team behind Aptos previously built the Diem blockchain, which was deployed in early 2020 to more than a dozen node operators. The mainnet of Aptos was launched in October 2022; its initial total supply of APT at mainnet was 1 billion tokens. After the initial hype, APT would fall to its lowest in December 2022 to $3.09.

Aptos, an innovative layer1 blockchain, is built upon the Move programming language and can be considered the successor to Meta\u2019s now-defunct Diem blockchain project. Centered on scalability, reliability, safety, and upgradeability, Aptos aims to bring ground-breaking concepts to the layer one space, featuring novel consensus mechanisms, performance optimization, system security, and smart contract designs. Aptos offers new and novel innovations in consensus, smart contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. Some of the key features of Aptos include: Native integration of Move: Move is a Rust-based programming language for fast and secure transaction execution. Flexible key management and hybrid custodial options: Aptos aims to provide a safer and more trustworthy user experience. Modular transaction processing: Transaction dissemination, block metadata ordering, transaction execution, batch storage, and ledger certification work in parallel. Atomicity without upfront knowledge of the data: This allows Aptos to increase throughput and decrease latency. Modular architecture: Allowing Aptos to offer frequent and instant upgrades. Innovative scaling solutions: Aptos supports internal sharding of a validator and homogeneous state sharding. How Does the Aptos Blockchain Work? PoS with advanced BFT consensus Aptos is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that employs a sophisticated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism, Light and full node clients Aptos categorizes its clients into two distinct groups \u2014 full node and light clients. Full node clients maintain a complete copy of the Aptos transaction ledger, while light clients store a streamlined version. Both types of clients communicate with validators to inquire about the ledger\u2019s history and current state before submitting transactions to be appended. Move programming language Aptos\u2019 whitepaper states that it employs the Move programming language\u2019s object model to depict the state of its ledger. Move, a relatively new programmable platform for blockchains, smart contracts, and other applications, was initially developed for Facebook (now Meta) for its discontinued crypto/blockchain projects, Libra and Diem. The Aptos team asserts that Move\u2019s advanced smart contract language is ideal for facilitating swift and secure transactions. Move simplifies the auditing and analysis of the blockchain and smart contracts that utilize it. Parallel transaction processing The Aptos blockchain supports parallel transaction processing, which is essential for achieving high scalability and throughput. By optimizing a multi-threaded, in-memory parallel engine using BlockSTM, it can deliver over 160,000 non-trivial Move transactions per second. The underlying infrastructure is designed for complex atomic transactions, ensuring transaction viability protection. Each transaction is fully completed or doesn\u2019t occur at all. This approach enables secure peer-to-peer trustless transactions with no intermediary. Conclusion Since its inception, Aptos has successfully integrated various projects. This is a promising development, as it expands the ecosystem\u2019s reach and potential for growth. With its current trajectory and sub-second transaction times, the Aptos crypto project holds the potential to surpass many of its rivals in the long run, provided it continues on this path. However, it is advised to research and conduct good investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.","article_summary":"Aptos Price Prediction 2024-2033 APTOS is carving its niche in a highly competitive market.

Lucid, another cryptocurrency analyst, has set an even more ambitious target, suggesting ADA could reach $30 next year, a potential increase of over 9,000% from its current price. This prediction hinges on the anticipation of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s total capitalization exceeding $10 trillion, driven by global factors acting as catalysts for growth. $ADA is going to $30!👑 Bitcoin proved to the whole world that a $1 Trillion market cap is attainable! Even Ethereum with all its issues hit $500 billion! With inflation the crypto market as a whole will be worth $10 Trillion within the decade! Cardano is going for the 100x!👻🔱 \u2014 Lucid (@LucidCiC) October 31, 2023 FieryTrading offers an even more optimistic forecast, projecting an increase of over 10,000% within the next two years. This prediction is based on ADA\u2019s consistent upward trajectory within a parallel channel, indicating potential for the price to hit the $35 mark eventually. Despite these long-term bullish predictions, short-term forecasts remain moderately optimistic. Institutional interest in Cardano also seems to be on the rise, as evidenced by data from CoinShares\u2019 latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report. Last week, Cardano-based investment products attracted over $800,000 in inflows, bringing their year-to-date total to $8 million. This institutional backing further solidifies the positive outlook for ADA in the near and extended future. Cardano Price History To understand the Cardano Price Forecast, it is imperative to look at the Cardano price movements historically. Before its launch in 2017, ADA coins were already on sale as far back as 2015, and sales continued till January 2017, after which it was launched. Its first rise in price was in January 2018, when it reached a record high of $1.31 due to the cryptocurrency rally. The price soon dropped to $0.15 by April, and by the end of the year, it was worth $0.04. it was worth only around $0.10 in 2019 and started increasing again in late 2020, finishing the year at $0.19. The crypto rally at the beginning of 2021 had seen the value of Cardano cryptocurrency increase greatly, reaching recordord high of $1.49 by February 27, 2021. But, this was just the start, and ADA prices kept increasing. Later, in May, a price of $2.46 was reached by ADA, and this was an all-time high. Thereafter, it continued to maintain its price within the range of $1.20 \u2013 $2. On September 2, 2021, the Cardano (ADA) price reached a new ATH or all-time high at $3.10 and has been the best-performing coin in the crypto world along with Solana, Algorand, Luna, and Tezos for the past month, experiencing a bullish trend. The Cardano price analysis shows negative signs after a brief bullish turnaround. In the meantime, the bulls have lost control of the Cardano market, which could signal new lows for the cryptocurrency. Analysts are optimistic about the fortunes of the market, and ADA could experience a turnaround in 2024 as expected of the entire cryptocurrency market. Cardano (ADA) has experienced a modest increase in its value, rising by $0.01. This uptick is part of a broader positive trend for ADA, which has seen its price increase by 5.23% over the last week, indicating a strong performance in the short term. Moreover, the past month has been particularly promising for Cardano, as it has registered an 8.16% increase in its price, with an average gain of $0.04 to its value. This steady upward movement suggests growing investor confidence and potential for Cardano in the cryptocurrency market. More on the Cardano (ADA) Ecosystem What is Cardano? Cardano is the habitat for the ADA cryptocurrency, mainly used to send and receive digital funds, making direct transfers fast and possible through cryptography. More than being a cryptocurrency, it is a technological platform that helps run the financial applications individuals and institutions use worldwide. The platform is being constructed in layers that allow for soft fork upgrades. Cardano blockchain also runs decentralized applications and services that any third parties do not control. This is the first blockchain project designed by a global team of engineers and can be implemented on mission-critical systems such as aerospace and banking applications. The Cardano Foundation has also declared the launch of the final version of the Alonzo Testnet, which will feature smart contracts on the platform. The new upgrade is termed Alonzo White, and with this release, investors are attracted to Cardano. Along with this, the coin was also added to the Grayscale Trust, and there are plenty of supporters of Cardano like eToro. Owing to the public\u2019s increased interest in Cardano and smart contracts, the organization behind the currency, Input Output Hong Kong, has spun up the Alonzo Purple testnet. The onboarding process has already been initiated, and the testnet will be made live once done. It was created by Charles Hoskinson, ex-Ethereum Co-Founder, and is considered a third-generation blockchain behind the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was launched back in 2017 to compete with Ethereum. The coin took over the number three spot after Ethereum after blockchain technology company IOHK developers of Cardano ADA announced the date for the Alonzo hard fork on the Cardano mainnet. Alonzo became live on the Cardano network on September 13, 2021, which might lead to a surge in Cardano prices. Projects involving Cardano Cardano has been involved directly or indirectly in several projects since its launch. In April 2019, The company behind the Cardano Blockchain, IOHK, also launched Atala, which is an enterprise blockchain framework designed for the Ethiopian government and other African countries. Later on, in September of the same year, Cardano entered into a partnership with the athletic wear company, New Balance, enabling the company to use the blockchain to detect fake footwear. In 2020, IOHK launched Project Atlas and Project Catalyst. Project Atlas aimed to improve users\u2019 experience on the Cardano platform through service integration and more accessibility to its tools and products. On the other hand, Project Catalyst sought to accelerate community innovation and develop on-chain governance. Recently, Cardano has partnered with Nervos token and the integration of Marlowe on the Cardano blockchain can come in handy for trading ETFs. Cardano accelerating in NFT space Cardano-based NFTs are quite popular nowadays because of the surge in Ethereum gas fees. The rising congestion and gas fees make the Cardano ecosystem most suited for NFT tokens. Recently, we have seen a lot of partnerships between Cardano and NFT artists. DJ Paul Oakenfold, a Grammy winner EDM artist, has teamed up with Cardano to launch his next album as NFTs. The digital asset album will be based on the Cardano blockchain and is named \u201cZombie Lobster.\u201d The plan is to focus on new NFT projects on Cardano; therefore, Starship Universe, an NFT project, deserves special mention. This project is being managed by Alon Shulman, who has partnered with Cardano to release thousands of NFT tokens under this new project. Cardano Compatible Wallets There are available wallets to store your Cardano crypto assets; to do that, you need to have at least one of the following wallets; Binance Coinbase Gemini Kraken Trezor Coinsmart Ledger Nano Cex.io Conclusion Over and over again, the cryptosphere has proven to be quite subject to speculations and market sentiment (whether positive or negative) \u2013 as made evident by BTC\u2019s recovery back up to $42k, and ETH at $2.2k. Cardano is currently in a bullish phase, and the current Cardano price predictions are largely positive. Depending on the developments in the crypto market, we could see significant growth in market capitalization and price in 2024. You may buy Cardano ADA tokens at top-tier crypto markets like Binance, Huobi global, and Bitfinex.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event. What is Bitcoin halving? The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors. Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving. 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I\u2019ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren. 5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that\u2019s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs. Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a \"hodling\" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income? Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment. 5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively. Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving Efficiency is Key: Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem. Strategic Planning: Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols. Adapt and Evaluate: Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards. Collaborative Mining: Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards. Leverage Mining Solutions: Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving. What is the difficulty of mining after halving? The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa. Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include: Mining Altcoins: While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue. Mining Pools and Services: Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects. Hardware Sales and Leasing: Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations. Staking and Masternodes: Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees. Blockchain Development and Consulting: Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting. Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments: Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies. Energy Trading and Grid Services: Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs. Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions: Price Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics. Speculative Activity: Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions. Market Sentiment: Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines. Miner Behavior: The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics. Macro-Economic Factors: External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements. Long-Term Outlook: Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest. While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved. Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition? Efficiency Improvements: One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs. Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing: Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability. Vertical Integration: Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams. Diversification of Revenue Streams: As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments. Hedging Strategies: Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions. Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability. Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions. To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events: November 28, 2012: Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. July 9, 2016: The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. May 20, 2020: The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch \u2014 a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years \u2013 will see Bitcoin\u2019s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. ~94% of the total #bitcoin supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days 👀 Digital scarcity at its finest 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024 Gold Throughout the Ages One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a \u201cfine man\u2019s suit\u201d over time. This principle, known as the \u201cgold-to-decent-suit ratio,\u201d can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga. While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man\u2019s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges. For example, the cost of verification \u2013 or assaying \u2013 gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value. Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous \u201dNixon Shock\u201d in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good. This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. Executive Order 6102 comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited \u201cthe hoarding of gold coin\u201d, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value.

Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals. As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years \u2013 reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024. Source: Glassnode While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a store of value better than gold, it is certainly promising. This \u201cmagic internet money\u201d continues to rapidly gain on gold\u2019s estimated $15.9 trillion market capitalization. Gold\u2019s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals. Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its informational nature, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute. Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s network of nodes and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s rise as a monetary good \u2013 predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable \u2013 has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold\u2019s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement. While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time. Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s time to shine.","article_summary":"For the first time, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is set to surpass gold after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China. Hong Kong\u2019s new ETF has been in the making for several months now, and it\u2019s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it\u2019s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) already passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it\u2019s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market. Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of big players from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media reported that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city. Considering that there are already signs of diminishing ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis report $90 billion worth of transactions in one year? Source Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves many windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: \u201cIf you get scammed, don\u2019t expect our help or sympathy.\" Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions. It\u2019s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it\u2019s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they\u2019ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have invested heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that\u2019s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. Click the image to learn more. Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong\u2019s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin\u2019s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? As far as Hong Kong\u2019s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local banks shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. The South China Morning Post reported on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new \u201cGlobal\u201d initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to \u201covertake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\" A very tall order. And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the Post that \u201cWe have seen their data and we don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be difficult\u201d. He added that most global competitors are either \u201ceasy to use but not compliant\u201d, or \u201ccompliant but hard to use\u201d, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It\u2019s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to offer nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business\u2019 reigning champs won\u2019t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was reportedly mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city\u2019s own existing firms are confident that they\u2019ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? It\u2019s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It\u2019s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.","article_summary":"With Hong Kong asset managers somewhat reluctant to submit applications for the new ETF, a series of multibillion-dollar firms from Mainland China have entered the market.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-04-11T21:00:00Z","type":"article","category":["Bitcoin ETF","Bitcoin Magazine Pro","Markets","Hong Kong"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count. Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. \u201cThe early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for \u2018crypto\u2019 venture\u2019s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,\u201d said Calicott. \u201cWith a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.\u201d In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested. \u201cDue to cyclicality and bitcoin\u2019s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,\u201d Calicott continued. \u201cDespite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.\u201d TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.

Sound Advisory provides financial advisory services and specializes in educating and guiding clients to thrive financially in a bitcoin-powered world. Click here to learn more. One of the simplest and most effective ways to improve your financial situation: Don\u2019t get killed on taxes. Taxes are a major friction in most people\u2019s financial lives, and a little foresight and planning can go a long way. This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. Let\u2019s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies. Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back. The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how: KYC Compliance: All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings. Transaction History: Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions. Reporting to IRS: Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains. Legal Precedents: The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions. Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly. Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season. To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments. Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year. Source: Sound Advisory If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income. Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin\u2014bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. Strategies and Case Studies Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn\u2019t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. When accounting for transactions, it\u2019s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. The IRS allows for \u201cspecific identification\u201d accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item\u2014in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains. Scenario: Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000. With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000). With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000). HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case. These would be short-term capital gains, so let\u2019s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. It\u2019s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly. Tax loss harvesting Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we\u2019ll leave it here for future readers. In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price. Scenario: Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved. Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the tax loss carry forward technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains. If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain\u2019t so bad. Sign me up. I\u2019ll even pay it twice. And \u201ctaxable income\u201d is calculated after the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single). Scenario: Let\u2019s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free). And we\u2019ll assume that they live in one of the nine US states that don\u2019t have an income tax, so let\u2019s call it 0% state tax as well. It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free\u2014valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a strategic sell and immediate rebuy opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies Roth IRA conversions or liquidating assets through installment sales. Gifting We\u2019ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people. Charity When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed. Scenario: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he\u2019d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains. You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to have less bitcoin!\u201d If bitcoin holders are familiar with \u201cspend and replace,\u201d we can consider a similar strategy like \u201cdonate and replace.\u201d You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes. Donor-advised funds For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a \"charitable savings account\": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time. Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications. Friends and family Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you). Scenario: A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their \u201clifetime bucket.\u201d Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. Roth accounts Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability. If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings. If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution. Conclusion The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you. With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort. A note on wash sales The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin. Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended. Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit. It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency. 1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events. 2) These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. CONTACT Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

","author":"Ivan Serrano","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin has shown itself among the best-performing assets in the last decade. In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250\u2014a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset briefly touched $70,000 recently. With this kind of growth, it\u2019s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to \u201cHODL\" until it reaches new price highs. However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC? Bitcoin loans offer a solution that provides access to liquidity without letting go of your holdings. How does a Bitcoin loan work? Here, we delve into the unique mechanics of a Bitcoin loan. We discuss how the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the world of finance beyond trading by providing alternative means to secure loans while retaining access to potentially higher returns in the future. Click the image to learn more. Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments\u2014similar to how a bank operates. Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent\u2014thus becoming overcollateralized loans. How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings. Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: Risks associated with rehypothecation Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties. With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral\u2014or even 100 percent\u2014is at risk. Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on. Annual percentage rate (APR) The annual percentage rate, also known as the APR, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. LTV requirement The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates. Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV) The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. Tax implications Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best.

The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don\u2019t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification. Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.

Or is it the Laser-Eyed Maxis? Or is it both? The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it\u2019s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don\u2019t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn\u2019t have that, you likely didn\u2019t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. That dogma was necessary \u2014 without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn\u2019t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. Click the image above to subscribe! Which Church Do You Go To? The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn\u2019t die \u2014 it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn\u2019t destroy it \u2014 they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther\u2019s famous Theses. What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. The Protestants\u2019 Disgust With Indulgences So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let\u2019s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences \u2014 the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, \u201cAs soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs\u201d. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. \u201cJust follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.\u201d Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they\u2019re undeniable. In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that \u201cthis one simple trick\u201d is enough to guarantee an individual\u2019s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can\u2019t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It\u2019s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. Here\u2019s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn\u2019t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people \u2014 roughly the same size as the Catholic population \u2014 Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther\u2019s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one\u2019s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn\u2019t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. Dissent Breeds Dissent Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn\u2019t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it\u2019s simply a matter of survival. And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single \u201cProtestant\u201d dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as \u201cagainst\u201d the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as \u201cdoing what the Laser Eyes couldn\u2019t\u201d as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around \u201cowning the Laser Eyes\u201d. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? The JPEG People claim they are here to \u201cmake Bitcoin fun again\u201d, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to \u201cown the Laser Eyes\u201d. That doesn\u2019t produce anything of value. That doesn\u2019t actually inspire people with a vision. Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own. So what is the identity of the JPEG People without Laser Eyes to troll? Is there even one there when you take that away?

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it\u2019s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they\u2019ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network. The Liquidity Crunch The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator\u2019s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. For now let\u2019s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they should have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they have processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users\u2019 money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? The Options The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. So now that we understand the problem let\u2019s look at some potential solutions. Throttling You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. The problem with this is you don\u2019t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don\u2019t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. Multiple Operators Both BitVM 1 and BitVM 2 support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator\u2019s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator. It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren\u2019t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. Multiple Linear Operators In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. The Backstop In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users\u2019 funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist. So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users\u2019 funds and make them whole. I don\u2019t think this is that bad. Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users\u2019 funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. Wrapping Up At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users\u2019 funds, to losing operators\u2019 funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I\u2019ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first.","article_summary":"An analysis of the recent criticism of BitVM based two way pegs published by Taproot Wizards.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-04-10T01:40:00Z","type":"article","category":["BitVM","Technical","BitVM 2","Opinion","BitVM Pegs"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"},{"article_title":"The U.S. Needs To Lead in Bitcoin, Says Congressman Patrick McHenry","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington DC today, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) emphasized the importance of the United States taking a leadership role in Bitcoin and not lagging behind in during a fireside chat with Club for Growth President David McIntosh.

One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. I really liked Dhruv\u2019s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows: Version 1: The Commonly Held View The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you\u2019d describe this is \u201c6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.\u201d Version 2: Dhruv\u2019s View ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term \u201creleased\u201d to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term \u201cunlocked\u201d for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv\u2019s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv\u2019s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. Why is Dhruv\u2019s framing important? By framing mining as buying coins rather than creating coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? If miners are creating bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an \"inefficiency of scale\" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *purchasing* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don\u2019t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. Layer zero is what I\u2019d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin that already exist to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn\u2019t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a \u201ctwo sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.\u201d The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price collectively for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers \u201cwins the auction\u201d using Dhruv\u2019s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES. The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, \u201cEach of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says \u2018what were the most recent bids in time?\u2019 and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.\u201d The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users and the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero? What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says \u201cit\u2019s computations for bitcoin.\u201d Layer 0 is a \u201cmarket between two aggregates.\u201d It\u2019s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two \u201cparticipants\u201d in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work. The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think \u201chow wasteful,\" think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv\u2019s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. There are some who believe that transaction costs won\u2019t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future.

This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything? If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. Verifying Things Yourself When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network\u2019s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network Most people likely don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s bitcoin payments, if you aren\u2019t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. The Supply Cap The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not the, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. Keeping Your Bitcoin Private Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else\u2019s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. Why This is All Important While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits. Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don\u2019t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else\u2019s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network. Once you have your keys safely secured, it is absolutely important that you take this next step.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin\u2019s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it\u2019s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador\u2019s government uses Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, multiple defenses of Lightning\u2019s long-term viability as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network grew to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users\u2019 money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to question if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly quit the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes both the protocol\u2019s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, \u201ceveryone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people\u201d to Lightning, a \u201cmicroscopic\u201d amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, \u201calmost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it\u201d amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning\u2019s future prospects has emerged, as the network\u2019s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high. Source Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued optimism and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay secured $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes. This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase finalized a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange\u2019s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark\u2019s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to \u201cinscribe\u201d unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to inscribe discontinued video games. Download the full 20-page research report prepared by Tuur Demeester (Founder, Adamant Research) for Unchained. This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, claimed that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a \u201cvulnerability\u201d in Bitcoin, one that is being \u201cexploited... to spam the blockchain.\" The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been linked to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to \u201cfix\u201d this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals\u2019 continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance quoted their \u201congoing efforts to streamline product offerings\u201d as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning\u2019s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin\u2019s usability, while Ordinals\u2019 critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it\u2019s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr\u2019s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly rejected by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even endorsed Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a \u201crenaissance\u201d in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin\u2019s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain\u2019s flexibility and superiority over its competitors. Praise like this from such an important source could truly be groundbreaking. Events like this serve, more than anything, to prove once again that Bitcoin\u2019s spirit is not merely posed to disrupt established industries and build a more rational order on the wreckage. Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin\u2019s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It\u2019s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.","article_summary":"The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a \u201cdead end\u201d as capacity drops.

Harvest Fund manages over $230 billion in total assets, while Southern Fund oversees over $280 billion. Approval of Bitcoin ETF products from such influential institutions could significantly validate Bitcoin in the eyes of both Chinese regulators and investors. The news is also a testament to the evolving landscape of Bitcoin in China. Despite its previous crackdown on Bitcoin trading and mining, the country is now witnessing a shift. While the mainland remains cautious, Hong Kong has adopted a more open approach, attracting the attention of Chinese funds. By leveraging Hong Kong subsidiaries, major funds can gain exposure to Bitcoin in a compliant manner. The location provides a legal loophole for Chinese companies to participate in the burgeoning Bitcoin asset class. Industry insiders are buzzing with anticipation as they predict a significant milestone in Bitcoin. Hong Kong's first Bitcoin ETFs could potentially launch as early as Q2 this year.

The halving (also known as the \u201cHalvening\u201d) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the \u201cblock subsidy\u201d) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain. The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin\u2019s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. . WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING? The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 19, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period \u2014 or epoch \u2014 will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE Determine the block interval: While it\u2019s true that Bitcoin\u2019s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments. Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you\u2019re running one. Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin\u2019s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height. Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving. Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected. Current block height: can be found here. Block time: can be found here. Current date: xx/xx/xxxx Blocks per epoch: 210,000 Next halving block height: 210,000 times next halving number Calculation: (((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it\u2019s important to keep running the calculation. HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS As of March 2024, there have been three Bitcoin halvings: On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. On July 9, 2016, the second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. On May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. BITCOIN HALVING 2012 The 2012 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s first halving. Halving: Date: November 28, 2012 Halving number: 01 Block height: 210,000 Block reward: 25 Mined supply: 10,500,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 5,250,000 Percentage of mined supply: 25% BITCOIN HALVING 2016 The 2016 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s second halving.

Below, we provide a succinct overview of anticipated halving dates from 2024 to 2060, offering valuable insights into these upcoming milestones. Epoch Number Block height Halving Year Estimated Halving Date 04 (of 32) 840,000 2024 April 20, 2024 05 (of 32) 1,050,000 2028 2028 06 (of 32) 1,260,000 2032 2032 07 (of 32) 1,470,000 2036 2036 08 (of 32) 1,680,000 2040 2040 09 (of 32) 1,890,000 2044 2044 10 (of 32) 2,100,000 2048 2048 11 (of 32) 2,310,000 2052 2052 12 (of 32) 2,520,000 2056 2056 (cont\u2026) HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BITCOIN HALVING Halving events have consistently preceded significant increases in bitcoin\u2019s price, making them a focal point for market analysts. Price Appreciation Historically, bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced significant upswings following halving events due to the combination of reduced supply and increased demand. These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events. After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800. After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000. Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years. Challenges for Miners Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network\u2019s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin\u2019s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. FAQs: Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin\u2019s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it\u2019s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling. Is Bitcoin halving bullish? The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it\u2019s wise to remember that bitcoin\u2019s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak? A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. Should you buy bitcoin before the halving? Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it\u2019s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles.","article_summary":"As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway.

Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history. Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead. On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1 EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. As such, it\u2019s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners\u2019 interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it\u2019s the quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it\u2019s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody. Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there\u2019s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don\u2019t pay your taxes. For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again. However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on why FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR\u2019s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that \u201cwithout his New Deal, we would all have been lost.\u201d2 On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and \u201caccustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.\u201d3 All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is how FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. This is because, despite the fact that FDR\u2019s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America\u2019s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), \u201crule by personal decree\u201d4, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher. This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans\u2019 rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency \u201cNow, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes\u201d - Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses I\u2019m not sure anyone\u2019s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole not been Machiavellian enough, but in this case the historical record is clear. Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), \u2018disregarding the laws for good objects\u2019 has been practically a job requirement of the oval office. Carl Schmitt said that \u201cSovereign is he who decides on the exception.\u201d Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit \u2018extra-constitutional\u2019 exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt\u2019s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice. In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp. The phrase is \u201cnational emergency\u201d. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you\u2019re an American adult, it\u2019s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the \u2018anti-terrorism\u2019 provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19. In fact, it\u2019s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the \u2018national emergency\u2019 has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 National Emergencies Act. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.5 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States To give you a sense of the temporal nature of these \u2018emergencies\u2019, there are still in effect: 9 from the Obama administration, 10 from Bush II, 5 from Clinton, and even one from Jimmy Carter in 1979! This is what Milton Friedman was talking about when he said \u201cNothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.\u201d This is also the story of Executive Order 6102, for it too sprouted from an official national emergency. You can read this in order itself, where FDR states in the preamble: \u201cI, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist\u2026\u201d Executive Order 6102, 5 April 1933 But still, the story goes deeper. It\u2019s not just enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case in 1933. So what was FDR\u2019s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold? The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first. The Beginning: Principled Piracy In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia. About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the Rapid, to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the Jefferson, who claimed the ship\u2019s goods as a prize. Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the Jefferson. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.6 Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. \u201cBut\u201d, (I hear you interject), \u201cBy what definition could an \u2018American with gold\u2019 be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn\u2019t even a war in 1933!\u201d Fantastic points, and you\u2019re right to make them. To preface the answer, let\u2019s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major \u2018philosophies\u2019 that you might subscribe to. Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn\u2019t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these \u2018philosophies\u2019 help judges decide the \u2018right\u2019 way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that\u2019s another story). If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A \u2018Living Constitution\u2019 approach: where you basically say, \u2018to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today\u2019. The third approach is more or less how the law around \u2018national emergencies\u2019 has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate \u2018natural selection\u2019 evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast. So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. Now let\u2019s fill in the gaps and show how that happened. 1917: National Emergencies Go Up There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five. One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the Espionage Act, was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today. This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under. 1917 was also the first time the phrase \u201cnational emergency\u201d passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America\u2019s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.7 Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin\u2019 violation. This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since The Rapid, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle. The solution was the Trading with the Enemy Act, which brought the principle of The Rapid into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to \u201cdefine, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.\u201d8 In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.9 Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, \u201cperhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.\u201d10 This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives. For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.11 Source: New York Herald on March 28, 1918, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ This was all authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story. That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in \u201cforeign exchange\u201d, or by any foreign country.12 You might sense now that we\u2019re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness. But we\u2019re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President\u2019s power in 1917 was still limited to \u201cduring the time of war.\u201d13 It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it. Great Depression: FDR\u2019s Opportunity That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis. Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank\u2019s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would \u201cno longer take responsibility\u201d for the bank\u2019s \u201cdeficient reserves\u201d.14 What was going on? Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a \u2018gold standard\u2019 was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.15 The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country. However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government\u2019s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. Meanwhile, \u201call of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.\u201d16 FDR\u2019s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. He called out the \u201cunscrupulous money changers\u201d, and the \u201cfalsity of material wealth\u201d, and demanded that \u201cthere must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\u201d17 Now, if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a \u201cbroad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.\u201d18 It was all downhill from there. Two days after FDR\u2019s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a \u2018Bank Holiday\u2019 from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the \u201choarding\u201d.19 Stopping the run wasn\u2019t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting \u201cthe names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.\u201d20 On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate \u201cany transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.\u201d21 Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the Trading with the Enemy Act restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR\u2019s inaugural address, the Emergency Banking Act (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality. Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce \u201cduring time of war\u201d, or crucially, \u201cduring any other period of national emergency declared by the President.\u201d FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: \u201cHOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty\u201d22 This brings us to the end of the story. From The Rapid, to the Trading with the Enemy Act, to the Emergency Banking Act, to Executive Order 6102. The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn\u2019t. Conclusion: Could It Happen Again? Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin? Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes. The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn\u2019t control; Government wasn\u2019t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff. The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024. This isn\u2019t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either. The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. What does the next national emergency look like? A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities23 trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? We don\u2019t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate. In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of Alice in Wonderland\u2019s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff. Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a chance at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation. So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins. And see you in hell, FDR.

Advances in agriculture meant that people and their property were often geographically stationary, making them sitting ducks for \u201cspecialists in violence\u201d, the predecessors to modern governments, who back then, were both the plunderers and protectors against plunder. The stirrup, contoured saddle, spur, and curb bit had a combined similar disrupting effect, shifting power away from heavy cavalry to a single armed knight. The Gunpowder Revolution disrupted the feudal order of the day, reinforced in those days by the Catholic Church. Rees-Mogg and Davidson write, \u201cthe Church tended to make religious virtues of its own economic interests, while militating against the development of manufacturing and independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal system.\u201d The printing press disrupted the Church even further: causing it to lose its monopoly on biblical narrative. The result was a major loss in its influence and power, which gave way to the modern nation state. Rees-Mogg and Davidson argue that the microprocessor would inevitably disrupt the nation state in the same way that the printing press disrupted Christendom a few hundred years ago. The internet itself (a globally-interconnected community) and public key cryptography (which protects both communications and property of Bitcoin) are made possible by microprocessors. The present and future One major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the currency front. Since Bitcoin\u2019s 2009 inception, we have been able to transact permissionlessly, borderlessly, and (often) anonymously. Nation states have long been jealous of any challenge to their monopoly on money, and they will spend vast sums of money to ensure that there are no serious monetary rivals. Bitcoin serves as an alternative to that trap, which is why it is under attack by the likes of politicians and the crumbling legacy media. But to transact on Bitcoin, you need miners. No doubt, regulators in the United States and Europe observed as China outlawed Bitcoin mining in 2021, which only resulted in the majority of the hashing power moving from that country to the United States. So while they would probably wish to ban it in the United States and Europe outright, they know that they would only lose both regulatory control and tax revenue from Bitcoin miners by doing so. Thus, for now, not even Elizabeth Warren \u2013 the most Bitcoin-hostile legislator in Washington \u2013 proposes to outright ban Bitcoin. Instead, she proposes to expand know-your-customer (KYC) rules to essentially all parties within the Bitcoin ecosystem as well as discourage self-custody and privacy-enhancing technologies. Bitcoin does have an important weak point of centralization (for now): the hardware. The University of Cambridge produces industry reports on Bitcoin mining and communicates that, hardware-wise, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin miners report to use an \u201cASIC\u201d chip for mining Bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 hashing algorithm produced by Singapore-based company Bitmain, with competitors MicroBT and Canaan trailing behind. Regardless of where Bitmain produces its ASIC chips, the ideal scenario for Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization would be that production of ASIC miners (and the mining itself for that matter) would be dispersed around the world so that no specific region could have a definitive advantage, taking the majority control of the hashing power. A reasonable compromise would be one in which ASIC miners were produced, at scale and in high quality, by at least more manufacturers than there are now, especially across countries that are not politically aligned with one another so that collusion between them would be increasingly unlikely. A second major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) front. I once attended a conference in which Peter Thiel participated as a speaker. He said something very close to the following (quoted from my memory): \u201cBitcoin is a technology that, on net, favors the individual. AI is a technology that, on net, favors the state.\u201d It is the latter technology and its favoring the state that emphasizes the importance of getting it into the hands of as many participants as possible if we are to build a truly decentralized world. One risk to AI\u2019s decentralization is one that Bitcoin has in common: a potential future scenario in which hardware is monitored and must be registered by law. In the case of Bitcoin, that would mean miners must register their ASIC chips. In the case of AI, it could mean that even you or I would need to register graphics processing units (GPUs) above a certain capacity (or, in the case of software, that matrices must be registered). Guillaume Verdon, the name behind the now doxed alias @BasedBeffJesos, highlighted this risk in a podcast with Lex Fridman, arguing that this could \u201c[stop] the open source ecosystem from thriving\u2026 by executive order, claiming that open source LLMs are dual-use technologies and should be government-controlled.\u201d Although executive orders could not kill Bitcoin (but could discourage some people from using it), similar reporting requirements for miners would likely, to some degree, impact Bitcoin\u2019s open source ecosystem. A third major battleground worth highlighting is 3D printers, assemblers, and other tools in the \u201cmaker\u201d arsenal. This \u201cmaker\u201d movement hints at a future solution to the problem of centralization tendencies for Bitcoin and AI. Imagine a world with 3D printers and accompanying tools in most people\u2019s homes. If you could print your own high-quality ASIC Bitcoin miners and GPUs for running large language models (LLMs), decentralization is light-years ahead. We can ignore for a moment the futuristic scenario in which 3D printers and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools are used to produce hardware for Bitcoin and AI applications. Even at present, at least one government is looking at the 3D printer with the same skeptical eye that the Catholic Church had for the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries. New York State\u2019s Assembly Bill A8132, if passed into law, would require criminal background checks, with fingerprints sent to the FBI, in order to purchase 3D printers \u201ccapable of creating firearms.\u201d It is reasonable to expect that various governments, fearing loss of their own centralized power, will continue to push registration and \u201cKYC\u201d requirements to maintain control of real-space tools that facilitate decentralization in cyberspace. Note: The Soviet Union had similar controls on seemingly harmless products such as books, photocopiers, fax machines \u2013 all of which facilitated the spread of information, and thus, threatened the regime. There were similar efforts to control the sale of fabric that could be used to build hot air balloons in East Germany, to stop people from escaping to West Germany. (See the 1982 American film Night Crossing and the 2018 German film Balloon that both document a real escape). Localized manufacturing, whether at home or in a so-called community fabrication laboratory or \u201cfab lab\u201d, is likely to come under increased hostility by various governments as 3D printers and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools are able to produce even more sophisticated electronics. But, for now at least, fab labs are growing exponentially in number, with well over 2,000 of them spread around the world so far, and even receive various levels of support by governments. These fab labs, by the way, don\u2019t account for the many more personalized labs in people\u2019s homes. Neil Gershenfeld at MIT\u2019s Center for Bits and Atoms tries to understand what the world looks like when almost anybody can make almost anything and when machines can make other machines, even machines more sophisticated than themselves, and often with locally-sourced materials. Gershenfeld argues in a podcast appearance that localized manufacturing doesn\u2019t scale and that production is generally for personal use, not commercial sale. But when many thousands of people around the world learn how to locally produce their own 3D-printed and home-assembled Bitcoin miner and then combine their individual hashing power with others in a mining pool and coordinate with one another over the Tor network\u2026 then the world starts to look much more decentralized. Conclusion Bitcoin, AI, and 3D printers share a common theme of decentralization and disruptive potential for the nation state. As both Bitcoin\u2019s ASIC mining chips and GPUs used to run LLMs exist in real-space where nation states are most dominant, governments may become increasingly hostile towards such hardware: requiring criminal background checks, KYC, etc. Interestingly, 3D printers, assemblers, and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools could be used now or in the future for localized manufacturing (whether at home or in so-called \u201cfab labs\u201d), enabling a much more decentralized world. Meanwhile, on the policy front, criminal background checks and registration requirements for 3D printers and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools such as those proposed in New York\u2019s Assembly Bill A8132 deserve a skeptical eye and strong political pushback.

It is a brazen attempt to assert foreign influence across Latin America and threatens to reshape the very fabric of the region and the day to day lives of its people. At its core is a serpentine set of contractual obligations, held at the municipal level, cast throughout Central and South America, upheld by an intelligence-linked satellite company, and controlled by a private sector consortium of green-washed financiers aiming to turn the region\u2019s forests into equity and carbon credits. At the same time, it obliges local governments to spend \u201cconservation\u201d funds on projects that further financialize nature and aid the construction of an inter-continental \u201csmart\u201d grid. One of its key ambitions appears to be further entrenching the debt load of the region through the multi-lateral development banks and the dollarization of the continent from the subnational level up through carbon markets upheld by a digital ledger. What seems like a technological marvel aimed at progress and connectivity harbors a darker agenda \u2014 one that intertwines planetary surveillance, financial predation, geopolitical maneuvering, and the domination of a resource-rich continent buried in debt. This grand design, known by the acronym GREEN+ and conceived by stalwarts of the digital dollar and debt schemes of the private sector, has quietly taken root through a web of political entanglements at the local level. Even a key figure in the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal plays a role. Astonishingly, every capital city of Latin America has eagerly signed on, apparently unaware of the strings attached to these seemingly benign partnerships, while a majority of municipalities in the region have also made commitments with these same groups that will push them to join GREEN+, potentially in a matter of weeks. The (hopefully) well-meaning regional governments have unwittingly paved the way for a sweeping surveillance apparatus tied to American intelligence that threatens to erode privacy and civil liberties under the guise of progress and combating the climate crisis. Upon further observation, GREEN+'s connections reveal a disturbing narrative of financial interests melding with geopolitical ambitions. The backers of the satellite company share ties with former members of the highest offices of US financial policy and regulation alongside the key architects and profiteers of private capital creation, aiming to consolidate control over monetary flows in Latin America within the redistribution of distressed government debt from the public to the private sector. As this two-part series will show, this concerted effort is not merely about surveillance \u2013 it's a calculated move towards further dollarization, tightening the grip of corporate and technological monopolies over the economic landscape of the Americas. The scheme's proponents also speak of how it will significantly advance the \"economic\" and \"regional\" integration of the Americas, invoking visions of unity while obscuring the true nature of their agenda for economic domination and stronger regional governance. Their model, eerily reminiscent of the EU's transition from a free trade union to a bureaucratic behemoth yoked to the US through the Eurodollar, sets the stage for unelected entities to enforce policies through programmable money, enabled by smart contracts on blockchains and designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. What materializes before us is not just a technological evolution but a quiet banker coup \u2014 one that lays the groundwork for land grabs and invasive surveillance under the guise of progress and conservation. It's a narrative that echoes throughout history, where intelligence-linked figures and predatory financial interests converge to prey upon the Global South, leaving a trail of economic exploitation and geopolitical manipulation in their wake. What masquerades as progress for individuals and the environment at large may very well be the harbinger of a new era of subjugation and control. GREEN+ The GREEN+ Program In 2022, several groups came together to launch the GREEN+ (Government Reduction of Emissions for Environmental Net + Gain) Jurisdictional Programme, the \u201cfirst program that will monitor by satellite all subnational protected areas of the planet\u201d and \u2013 through contracts with numerous local and state governments \u2013 propel and deepen the economic integration of the Americas through the quiet imposition of a continent-wide, blockchain-based carbon market. GREEN+ has been piloted in a handful of Latin American cities since its founding and is due to launch globally in just a few weeks time. Most of the GREEN+ agreements with \u201csubnational\u201d governments have remained focused on Latin America. Per the program, the subnational agreements have established the \u201crules and requirements to enable accounting and crediting with GREEN+ policies and measures and/or nested projects, implemented as GHG mitigation activities,\u201d with GREEN+ being described as \u201cthe planet's new subnational government advisory mechanism.\u201d Key to the program are the services provided by GREEN+ founding member Satellogic, an Argentina-founded company closely aligned with Peter Thiel\u2019s Palantir and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX that specializes in sub-meter resolution satellite surveillance. Satellogic, a contractor to the US government and whose founders were also previously contactors for the US\u2019 DHS, NSA and DARPA, will provide surveillance data of the entire world\u2019s \u201cprotected areas\u201d to GREEN+\u2019s governing coalition, composed of the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network, The Energy Coalition and other \u201crespected stakeholders.\u201d According to the press release that details Satellogic\u2019s alliance with GREEN+, the satellite surveillance data \u201cwill enable individuals, organizations, and global markets to accurately monitor the compliance of signatory jurisdictions to avoid deforestation.\u201d However, other information in the press release reveals that forests will actually be monitored for the purpose of generating \u201ccredible\u201d carbon credits to be traded on exchanges by GREEN+ on behalf of subnational governments. The press release also states that the GREEN+ alliance with Satellogic will \u201cadvance the future measurement of energy emissions in the most populated areas of the planet,\u201d i.e. the surveillance of carbon emissions from space. Satellogic launched some GREEN+-affiliated satellites in 2022 as part of its pilot and is due to launch the remainder this April during Miami Climate Week. Satellogic\u2019s past and upcoming launches of GREEN+ satellites were/will be conducted in collaboration with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, also a contractor to the US military and US intelligence agencies. Satellogic and GREEN+ Though framed as a way to develop economic incentives to mitigate climate change, the program is based on California\u2019s controversial and grift-prone cap and trade program and has been created (and is being implemented by) individuals and companies that are seeking to covertly dollarize Latin America and/or have deep ties to US intelligence. Its ultimate ambitions go far beyond carbon markets and seek to use satellite surveillance to enforce carbon emission levels in both urban and rural areas. It also seeks to impose a new financial system centered around energy, commodity, and natural resource \u201ccredits\u201d that are underpinned by extensive and invasive surveillance, underscored by the motto: \u201cEarth observation is preservation.\u201d The alliance that created GREEN+ includes the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network (GFN), Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s Catalytic Finance Foundation (CFF, formerly R20) and The Energy Coalition (TEC); the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas; the global insurance giant Lockton; the satellite company Satellogic; the \u201cgreen\u201d blockchain company EcoRegistry; the dominant carbon credit certifier in Latin America, Cercarbono; and Rootstock (RSK), the bitcoin side-chain protocol responsible for \u201csmart BTC.\u201d Several members of the alliance, though how many is unclear, now operate as part of a consortium linked to a company called Global Carbon Parks, which is discussed in greater detail later in this article and now manages major aspects of GREEN+. The NGOs (i.e. CC35, GFN, CFF and TEC) involved in founding GREEN+ are those who actually govern the GREEN+ program from California. As previously mentioned, the program takes carbon in \u201ceffectively conserved protected areas of a sub-national jurisdiction\u201d, i.e. a city, county, province, or state/region, and converts them into carbon credits. Per the program, \u201cthese credits are traded on the [carbon] offset market, and income is deposited in a trust fund\u201d that is controlled by GREEN+ and is known as the GREEN+ Trust. That trust is run by unspecified individuals who work for Lockton, Isolas and Rootstock. Alejandro Guerrero, head of Lockton\u2019s Argentina & Uruguay branch, is the only publicly acknowledged member of the trust. Another website tied to the GREEN+ initiative describes the initial process as follows: Public and private agreements between [a subnational] government and custodians are signed with zero upfront cost. Custodians trade the carbon units that are produced by the subnational governments (the public sector) signing contracts with the private sector in voluntary carbon markets. Those contracts signed by the subnational governments become smart contracts and carbon credits are then tokenized for traceability. The GREEN+ Trust holds government funds in escrow. Subsequently, \u201ca partial release of trust funds is made periodically during the crediting period of the jurisdictional initiative.\u201d From this \u201cpartial release,\u201d \u201ca percentage operational fee\u201d is deducted (the percentage is undisclosed in the program\u2019s documents) and paid to the GREEN+ program while a separate (and also undisclosed) fee is also deducted \u201cfor the operation of the GREEN+ Trust.\u201d Disbursements of what remains are made annually over a ten year period and, per graphs produced by GREEN+, those payments remain the same, fixed value even if the value of the carbon credits of the protected areas grows. From GREEN+ Between 40% and 60% of the funds actually received by subnational governments can be used to \u201cdesign and execute projects\u201d aimed at conservation, while the rest \u201cis allocated for new jurisdictional decarbonisation initiatives\u201d that can produce additional or \u201cconsequential\u201d carbon credits. These \u201cconsequential\u201d credits are then \u201coffered as a preferred option to the investors who initially purchased the conservation credits at a 50% discounted price calculated at the current market price.\u201d However, later in the same document, the program says that \u201cthe amount required for the initial implementation\u201d of conservation projects \u201cmay not exceed 20% of the funds allocated [from the GREEN+ Trust] to the jurisdictional initiative.\u201d Clearly, the amount of funds actually being generated for conservation-related projects is minimal and, even in the best case scenario, is less than half of the capital generated by the carbon credits themselves. However, as we shall see, these \u201cconservation\u201d projects must be done in conjunction with approved partners of Global Carbon Parks, which \u2013 like the organization itself \u2013 are tied to predatory financial interests and oligarchs with questionable motives. Of the funds that governments actually receive as part of GREEN+, half are officially meant to go toward conservation-related projects while the other half are meant to go toward decarbonization-related projects. However, on the Global Carbon Parks-GREEN+ website, it notes that the decarbonization projects must be conducted alongside Community Electricity, which forms part of Global Carbon Parks and is closely connected to the GREEN+ alliance member The Energy Coalition (TEC). As will be discussed later, TEC and Community Electricity are together attempting to build an inter-continental \u201csmart\u201d grid in the Americas and are also involved in efforts to develop \u201csmart\u201d cities and suburbs. As for GREEN+\u2019s conservation projects, the website states that \u201c50% of the resources received by the capital [city as part of GREEN+] must be used for social and environmental impact in protected urban areas with partners such as Cities4Forests.\u201d Cities4Forests was founded by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a World Economic Forum affiliate and contractor to suspected CIA front USAID that is focused on resource \u201csustainability.\u201d WRI is funded by the US and several European governments, billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg as well as Google, Meta/Facebook, the Soros family\u2019s Open Societies Foundations, the UN, Walmart, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, among others. WRI\u2019s Cities4Forests shares many of the same funding sources, such as the governments of the UK, Germany, Denmark and the US as well as the World Bank and the Caterpillar Foundation. Other funders include the Wall Street giant Citi Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Notably, the Rockefeller Foundation and the IDB recently teamed up to create the Intrinsic Exchange Group, which has spearheaded the financialization of nature via the creation of Natural Asset Corporations (NACs). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, NACs create corporations that take control of natural assets that were previously part of the \u201ccommons,\" such as forests, rivers and lakes, and then sell shares of those assets to Wall Street asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and other financial institutions in order to generate profit under the guise of \u201cconserving\u201d the asset they target. From GREEN+ Unsurprisingly, most of Cities4Forests\u2019 projects, such as those that would be built with GREEN+ funds, are similar to NACs in that they focus on using natural assets and \u201cnatural capital\u201d to produce new financial and insurance products. Examples of Cities4Forests \u201cconservation\u201d projects include the development of a Forest Resilience Bond and the India Forum for Nature-based Solutions. One of the India-based forum\u2019s \u201ccore partners\u201d is the Nature Conservancy, which has been run by Wall Street bankers for years and has pioneered the modern iteration of the controversial \u201cdebt for conservation\u201d swap among other \u201cnature-based solutions.\u201d The funders of Cities4Forest and its creator the WRI are also deeply affiliated with groups like the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and UN-backed climate finance initiatives that openly seek to use debt imperialism to herd the global economy, with a focus on emerging markets, into a new system of global financial governance. Thus, the \u201cconservation\u201d and \u201cdecarbonization\u201d efforts that subnational governments must enact as part of their contractual agreements with GREEN+ will go towards projects tied to either the smart grid/smart city developer Community Electricity or a \u201cconservation\u201d organization backed by Western oligarchs, multi-national corporations and banks that seeks to financialize and monetize nature under the guise of conserving it. CC35 and the Subnational Pivot CC35, or Ciudades Capitales de las Americas frente al Cambio Climático (American Capital Cities Facing Climate Change), is the most visible organization behind the GREEN+ program and one of the members of its governance committee. CC35\u2019s goal is the economic integration of the Americas (North, South and Central) through coordinated climate change policies, specifically the creation of an Inter-American carbon market, with GREEN+ being the means of implementing that market. The group focuses on \u201csubnational\u201d governments, namely capital cities of the Americas, thereby circumventing national governments with respect to Climate Change-related policy. Regarding GREEN+, Sebastián Navarro, the secretary general of CC35, stated of the program that: \u201cWe will be relentless from the governance of the GREEN+ program with those who want to continue playing with the future of humanity,\u201d adding that their \u201crelentless\u201d approach would be greatly aided by Satellogic\u2019s satellite surveillance capabilities, which would also \u201cgenerate unprecedented credibility among investors of the carbon credits produced by conservation.\u201d Navarro\u2019s promise to be \u201crelentless\u201d in governing a satellite surveillance regime of American forests for the purpose of producing \u201chigh-credibility\u201d carbon markets. Sebastián Navarro of CC35 While framed as an initiative \u201cborn out of Latin America,\u201d CC35 is registered in Miami; Florida (Coral Gables, specifically) and has long been funded and partnered with US-based interests. For instance, CC35\u2019s first partners were R20 (Regions of Climate Action, now the Catalytic Finance Foundation), a group created by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in partnership with the UN, and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. From there, CC35 partnered with UN and UN-linked organizations as well as Pegasus Capital Advisors, which also finances CC35 and Schwarzenegger\u2019s R20/Catalytic Finance Foundation. R20/Catalytic Finance, like CC35, focuses its attention on \u201csubnational\u201d governments. Pegasus Capital is the firm created by Craig Cogut, a key figure in the \u201cjunk bond\u201d financial scandal at the now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel\u2019s junk bond department, led by Michael Milken, engaged in blatantly illegal activity and used junk bonds to help fuel the takeovers of major corporations by the era\u2019s infamous \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d before the bank\u2019s collapse. Specifically, Cogut was the lawyer who advised the Milken-run and scandal-ridden junk bond department on the legality of transactions, including those that saw Milken become a convicted felon. Following Drexel\u2019s collapse, Cogut teamed up with a group of Drexel alumni led by Leon Black \u2013 now best known for his close association with the deceased sex trafficker and \"financial adviser\" Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 to co-found Apollo Advisers (now Apollo Global Management) in 1990. Cogut left Apollo to found Pegasus in 1996 and Pegasus has since became a key player in several UN-supported \u201cgreen\u201d finance initiatives. Cogut is also financially entangled with Satellogic\u2019s co-founder, Emiliano Kargieman, as will be discussed later. Cogut subsequently became a board member of Arizona State University\u2019s Global Institute of Sustainability, which was created by Michael Crow (and who served on the board alongside Cogut). Crow is chairman of the board of trustees In-Q-tel, the CIA\u2019s venture capital arm. Cogut also served on the board of ASU\u2019S McCain Institute, named for the late Senator John McCain, which has links to Ashton Kutcher\u2019s CIA-linked charity Thorn. Current board members of the McCain Institute include both Crow and former CIA director David Petraeus on its board, as well as Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who co-created the Council for Inclusive Capital with the Vatican. Cogut was also on the board of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), part of the Clinton family philanthropies, and CHAI was largely shaped and influenced by notorious sex trafficker and \u201cfinancial advisor for billionaires\u201d Jeffrey Epstein, having been the chief reason for former president Bill Clinton\u2019s flights on Epstein\u2019s plane in the early 2000s. Notably, Cogut is not the only Drexel alum to be involved in \u201cgreen finance.\u201d The field of \u201cgreen finance\u201d itself was essentially invented by Richard Sandor, who made millions at Drexel during the 1980s, pioneering \u201cinnovative\u201d products like the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), which would later contribute to the 2008 financial crisis. Sandor had previously been deemed the \u201cfather of financial futures\u201d and is also credited with helping create derivatives. After Drexel\u2019s collapse, Sandor moved on to pioneering carbon emissions trading and carbon markets with the vision of creating \u201can all-electronic exchange for carbon trading,\u201d a vision that has since taken shape. Craig Cogut of Pegasus Capital CC35 has long been led by Sebastián Navarro. Under his leadership, CC35 helped broker the creation of the Subnational Climate Fund, which is backed by Cogut\u2019s Pegasus Capital along with BNP Paribas, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bloomberg Philanthropies and the governments of Germany, the UK, Australia and the Netherlands. That fund focuses on financing infrastructure projects in the Global South at the subnational (e.g. city, state) level, again bypassing national governments. Indeed, the main modus operandi of CC35 is brokering contracts between small, subnational governments and \u201cgreen\u201d finance entities that are tied to centers of US/European political or financial power. Navarro is listed as a director of CC35 as are two prominent, right-leaning Latin American politicians: Felipe Alessandri Vergara, mayor of the Chilean capital Santiago from 2016 to 2021, and Nasry Asfura Zablah, former mayor of the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa and former Honduran presidential candidate. Alessandri is a well-known figure in Chilean center-right politics and an ally of the recently deceased former Chilean president Sebastián Piñera. Alessandri is controversial within the Chilean right for his covert support of initiatives generally favored by the left and publicly shunned by his party while serving as Santiago\u2019s mayor, such as climate finance/regional economic integration (via CC35) and his financing of initiatives related to illegal immigration. Alessandri\u2019s successor and supposed political nemesis, Irací Hassler of Chile\u2019s Communist Party, has since taken over for Alessandri as CC35\u2019s Vice President for South America. As for Nasry Asfura, he was the subject of a Honduran political scandal due to his appearance in the Pandora Papers and his alleged involvement in suspicious offshore finance activities. He was also indicted on money laundering and fund embezzlement, but charges were dropped under Asfura\u2019s successor Jorge Aldana, who is now president of CC35. The current vice president of CC35 for Central America is Mario Durán, the mayor of San Salvador and a close ally of El Salvador\u2019s president Nayib Bukele as well as a member of Bukele\u2019s Nuevas Ideas party. Durán is poised to take over the leadership of CC35 per a recent announcement from the group. In 2021, Durán signed a contract with CC35 regarding education about the use of Bitcoin in all metropolitan region municipalities in El Salvador, and is the only mention of CC35 promoting the use of Bitcoin. As will be noted again later on, the CC35-led GREEN+ initiative is partnered with Rootstock, which created and develops a Bitcoin sidechain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presumably, the goal is to run GREEN+\u2019s digital carbon market on the same blockchain. While it may seem odd to an American audience that \u201cregional integration\u201d efforts under the guise of climate change would be led largely by right-leaning politicians, it is important to point out that such integration efforts have historically been led by both left and right factions in Latin America, who compete for dominance over the region. For instance, right-leaning efforts at economically and/or politically integrating the Americas include Mercosur (the Southern Common Market, now championed by the \u201canti-globalist\u201d Javier Milei) and Prosur (Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America, launched by Chile\u2019s center-right Piñera). Left-leaning efforts include ALADI (Latin American Integration Association) and UNASUR (Union of South American Nations). All of these efforts have failed due to geopolitical disagreements mainly centered around whether to grant membership to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and others with governments estranged from the so-called \u201cWashington consensus\u201d or, more recently, efforts to forge closer ties to Russia and/or China. Given that several important Latin American countries can suddenly change what side of the \u201cconsensus\u201d they are on depending on presidential election results, such as recently happened in Brazil and Argentina, these regional integration efforts have failed to gain significant traction over the last several decades. Nevertheless, the end goal of economic integration begetting political integration remains the same. Thus, as CC35 shows, the push to regionally integrate Latin America has now, very quietly, pivoted away from engagement at the national level to the subnational level. Aurelio Peccei at the 3rd Annual WWF Congress in 1973 The Club of Rome\u2019s Global Footprint While CC35 is the most visible face of GREEN+\u2019s governing body, it is actually chaired by a group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN). The GFN exists to promote \u201cthe Ecological Footprint, which tracks how much nature we use and how much we have, as an accounting tool\u201d for green finance initiatives and originated the concept of \u201cecological debt\u201d based on that metric. Elsewhere, the GFN calls for \u201cone-planet prosperity\u201d and emphasizes climate finance, a field dominated by predatory Wall Street banks and billionaires, as an economic imperative. They work with governments at both the national and subnational level and establish the carbon emissions limits for localities, states and countries that programs like GREEN+ seek to enforce with satellite surveillance and binding contractual obligations. The GFN is intimately connected to the Club of Rome. For instance, GFN\u2019s founder and a member of its board, Mathis Wackernagel, who also co-created the Ecological Footprint concept, is a member of the Club of Rome. Wackernagel\u2019s former mentor and the other developer of the Ecological Footprint, William Rees, was a member of the Club of Rome until 2018. Heiko Specking, a GFN board member, is also affiliated with the Club of Rome as is another GFN board member, Lewis Akenji. The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 by the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King. Its earliest success was the 1972 report and later book \u201cThe Limits to Growth,\" which was based on an MIT study and claimed that \u201cif the world\u2019s consumption patterns and population growth continued at the same high rates of the time, the earth would strike its limits within a century.\u201d The book was heavily promoted by the earliest annual meetings of the World Economic Forum, particularly in 1973. Peccei, who spent a large part of his life living in Argentina, had previously been a member of ADELA, the Atlantic Community Development Group for Latin America. ADELA was composed of powerful Western companies that pooled money to invest in Latin American companies of their choosing, essentially \u201cking-making\u201d the titans of the Latin American corporate world. ADELA\u2019s backers included Bank of America, IBM, Fiat (where Peccei was an executive), and the Rockefeller family\u2019s Standard Oil. The group was part of the Rockefeller-dominated network in Latin America, which also included the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), which has been linked to the 1973 CIA-backed military coup in Chile through the Chilean Rockefeller associate Agustín Edwards, and Deltec, best known today as a main bank for the failed crypto exchange FTX and its close relationship with the stablecoin Tether. Modern iterations of this network include Endeavor and the Council of the Americas (CoA), which will be discussed in the second part of this series. Notably, it was Peccei\u2019s speech at an ADELA conference that spurred his partnership with Alexander King and led to the Club of Rome\u2019s formation. At the time he got involved with Peccei and made the Club of Rome, King was head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD was originally established as the OEEC to help administer the post-WWII, US-developed Marshall Plan and was later expanded to become a global organization in 1961. The US remains the OECD\u2019s main funder by a significant margin. The group has long claimed to promote \u201csustainable economic growth\u201d and \u201cconsistently improving standard of living in its member countries,\u201d but \u2013 in practice \u2013 it routinely favors neoliberal policies that enrich Western-based multi-national corporations. It is closely partnered with entities like the IMF, the World Bank and the broader multi-lateral development banking system that has used debt slavery sold as \u201ceconomic development\u201d to privatize state-owned assets and sell them off to privileged corporate interests. That system has also been considered by the US military to be part of its arsenal of \u201cfinancial weapons\u201d used to protect US interests abroad. The Club of Rome was criticized for many decades for embracing neo-Malthusian thought (i.e. eugenics and specifically population control measures in the developing world) as well as for promoting greater global governance. Some of its members have championed the imposition of a \u201cbenevolent\u201d global dictatorship. Criticisms of the Club of Rome have been voiced by academia as well as independent and mainstream media. The group\u2019s attempt to rebrand as an environmental group in order to gain popular support for those same policies was discussed in their 1991 book \u201cThe First Global Revolution,\u201d which states: \u201cIn searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.\u201d The Global Footprint Network\u2019s methods, products and ideology are very much aligned with the neo-Malthusian \u201cLimits to Growth\u201d view of the Club of Rome as well as the efforts to incorporate nature into financial markets via so-called \u201cnature-based solutions.\u201d Indeed, the GFN\u2019s ecological footprint metric is promoted by groups like the World Economic Forum and the World Wildlife Fund (where Peccei served on the board and which has long been tied to European oligarch and corporate interests). GFN also provides the statistical means of imposing Limits to Growth-style models that control both population levels and industrialization levels on governments by developing \u201cecological budgets\u201d that, as evidenced by GREEN+, are now interfacing directly with carbon markets. Building a \u201cGREEN\u201d Power Monopoly The other member of the GREEN+ governing committee that will control the program as well as Satellogic\u2019s surveillance data is The Energy Coalition (TEC). Notably, it was TEC\u2019s executive director Craig Perkins who said that GREEN+ would also enable the surveillance of carbon emissions of populated areas, presumably via satellite. TEC was founded by John Phillips, who ran Phillips Energy \u2013 an oil and gas company, in 1975. Since 1979, it has been closely partnered with local California governments via its Community Energy Partnership program. Currently, TEC is partnered with, and some of its key initiatives are financed by, major California gas companies, referred to by TEC as California\u2019s \u201cinvestor-owned utilities.\u201d These include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, SDGE and SoCalGas. With the backing of these major oil and gas companies, TEC assures us it is \u201ccreating the building blocks for a new energy economy.\u201d One of its main partners in doing so is Community Electricity, which claims to be \u201cbuilding the NASDAQ of the clean energy field.\u201d TEC and Community Electricity, which is backed by Google, have co-designed \u201ca master plan\u201d financed by the California Energy Commission \u201cto implement the largest and first-of-its-kind decarbonization by electrification protocols using DERs [distributed energy resources], carbon emissions management, blockchain, AI and IoT [internet of things] all connected under one plug-and-play platform.\u201d Community Electric designs, funds and develops this technology for GluHomes (formerly GluEnergy), its parent company which shares the same founder as Community Electricity \u2013 Felipe Cano. The program is being piloted in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as well as in disadvantaged communities in Colombia. The goal, per Cano, is to \u201cbring the Americas together\u201d through an inter-continental, \u201cclean\u201d smart grid. Helena Donoso, Samuel Garcia, Felipe Cano, Santiago F. Maldonado, and Sebastian Navarro The blockchain involved in these efforts is RSK, the smart contract-oriented sidechain that runs on top of the Bitcoin network. As previously mentioned, RSK is a founding member of GREEN+. The initiative involving TEC, Community Electricity, California\u2019s government, and RSK also seeks \u201cto digitize carbon credit reporting\u201d and to \u201ccreate opportunities for businesses to redeem credits.\u201d The Community Electricity/TEC program also uses the RSK blockchain to record a person\u2019s energy usage \u201cwith the help of RIF, an identity product [i.e. digital identity] developed by RSK Labs.\u201d The Community Electricity system requires a digital ID tied to a digital wallet that \u201cis embedded to store daily profits derived from surplus energy sales\u201d that allow electricity consumers to trade energy credits and become what the company calls \u201cprosumers,\u201d with the goal of creating \u201can energy social network.\u201d The Community Electricity hardware produced with GluHomes also \u201cutilize[s] AI and machine learning to transform any home intro a smart micro electricity generation utility.\u201d The group is partnering with real estate developers to develop smart homes connected to their energy-related technology, with a focus on social housing and affordable housing, i.e. housing for lower income families. The goal is to connect together retro-fitted existing homes, new smart homes, a neighborhood co-op of electric vehicles and a reward-payment system called GluPay, which is partnered with Mastercard and Contigo, which designs products \u201cfor the unbanked, immigrants, homeless and disadvantaged population,\u201d with a focus on remittance payments. Contigo is currently in talks with El Salvador\u2019s government to have the company\u2019s \u201cPayments Wallet tied into the Salvadoran financial inclusion products.\u201d Contigo is run by Raul Hinojosa, an academic at UCLA who wrote a book entitled \u201cConvergence and Divergence between NAFTA, Chile, and MERCOSUR: Overcoming Dilemmas of North and South American Economic Integration,\u201d which focuses on \u201cthe impact of a potential Free Trade of the Americas Agreement.\u201d The creator of Community Electricity and GluHomes, Felipe Cano has also spent most of his career attempting to economically integrate large swathes of the world. For instance, in 1998, his vision was \u201cto unify both European and US stock exchanges under one platform and protocol, the create the smart grid of the equity market and stock trading in a bilateral, single network.\u201d This vision led him to create ECN Access, which \u201cwas the first tech hub in Europe to route the first block of institutional order flows from a European Bank directly to the NASDAQ electronic exchange without intermediaries,\u201d creating what Cano calls \u201cthe first smart grid every built.\u201d He then sought to \u201ccreate a digital market for the energy sector,\u201d which has since culminated in his creation of Community Electricity and GluHomes. Cano is an adviser to TEC and is also a senior partner at Silverbear Capital, where he focuses on investments related to smart cities. According to his bio at Silverbear, Cano is also CEO of \u201cOlidata Smart Cities LLC, a market-maker platform which uses nano-grids and microgrids as the underlying strategy to deploy the Internet of Things Protocol of the future.\u201d Cano was also, until recently, the president of Global Carbon Parks, which is a consortium of companies, the only known members of which all happen to be companies that founded GREEN+, with the one exception being Cano\u2019s Community Electricity. Global Carbon Parks, unsurprisingly, is now one of the main implementers of the GREEN+ program. Global Carbon Parks is also partnered with Aclima, a start-up backed by Microsoft and the foundation of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Global Carbon Park\u2019s stated mission is to \u201ctransform protected areas into natural equity\u201d via public-private partnerships, essentially admitting that the GREEN+ program it now helps manage is about financializing protected natural assets and resources. Felipe Cano - GluHomes Inc Global Carbon Parks \u201ctransforms\u201d these forests into \u201cnatural equity\u201d by measuring, certifying and trading carbon credits in conjunction with the carbon credit certification Cercarbono (discussed later in this article). Their partnership with Satellogic, which goes beyond but also includes the GREEN+ program, uses satellite surveillance \u201cto ensure the integrity of the preserved area\u201d which contains the carbon represented by the carbon credits. The company also promotes their integration with The Energy Coalition and Community Electricity to develop \u201cadvanced electricity communities\u201d that develop \u201crenewable energy credits,\" which the company claims will \u201ccontribute to local wealth creation.\u201d The company is partnered with a financial firm, which does the actual trading of carbon credits for both Global Carbon Parks and presumably GREEN+. However, Global Carbon Parks declines to reveal their identity, merely stating that \u201cThey are a financial firm that integrates technical, economic, and environmental solutions.\u201d In summary, the governance of the GREEN+ program and the group with control over its satellite surveillance data; are tied to or funded by groups that have long used debt as a form of control over the Global South in particular; seek to control the population size and the degree of industrialization in countries; are tied to globalist efforts to economically and politically integrate the Americas; are building a Bitcoin blockchain-based smart grid that surveils and limits energy usage and links energy usage to currency; and are integrating and tokenizing the natural world, including endangered or protected areas, into the financial system under the guise of conservation. Through CC35\u2019s Alcades por el Clima (Mayors for the Climate) initiative, over 15,000 local governments in Latin America have signed agreements with CC35 related to carbon emission trading schemes and limits, led by Brazil (5,564 local governments), Argentina (2,457 local governments), and Mexico (2,481 local governments). Presumably, those carbon neutrality/trading agreements will allow CC35 to push those municipalities into the GREEN+ program, if they aren\u2019t already planning to participate directly (many are). In other words, the vast majority of Latin America, unbeknownst to the vast majority of its populace, is already contractually yoked to one of the main organizations behind the GREEN+ program \u2013 run by interests tied to foreign banks, corporations and even intelligence services. The program is set to launch continent-wide in a matter of weeks. As this article and subsequent article will show, what has transpired is a brazen attempt to conduct a silent coup of the continent\u2019s natural resources, energy production, local governments and economy. The GREEN+ Trust and the Bitcoin Carbon Market The GREEN+ Trust, which is to hold and handle the profits from the carbon credits produced and then disburse them to governments if certain conditions are met, is to be managed by individuals \u201cselected from the members institutions of the [GREEN+] Executive Board\u201d as well as from Isolas, Lockton and Rootstock (RSK). According to GREEN+, the Trust is not only responsible for fund custody, but also \u201cthe regulation of smart contracts, in coordination with the certification standard [Cercarbono] and the monitoring of mitigation initiatives [conducted by Satellogic].\u201d The only known member of the Trust, as previously mentioned, is Alejandro Guerrero, the head of Lockton\u2019s branch in Argentina and Uruguay. Lockton, a founding member of GREEN+ and also of Global Carbon Parks, is the world\u2019s largest, privately held insurance brokerage firm that also provides risk management services, employee benefits and retirement services. They are owned by the Lockton family and the company \u2013 and the family behind it \u2013 are rather secretive. However, the company has been overt about the opportunities they see in the type of carbon market that initiatives like GREEN+ will create. In a 2023 article, Lockton\u2019s head of Digital Integration and Special Projects, David Briscoe, wrote that making carbon credits \u201ca stable and trusted currency\u201d would \u201crequire the support of the insurance market.\u201d This is because, as Briscoe notes, \u201cvoluntary\u201d carbon markets come with risks, particularly because \u201cof the financial values involved.\u201d Per Briscoe, these risks include \u201cnon- or under-delivery of forward purchased carbon removal credits,\" \u201cstart-ups involved in the voluntary carbon market may face insolvency risks,\u201d and \u201cfraud and negligence.\u201d Indeed, mismanagement and fraud has been a major driver of why carbon markets have failed to catch on despite relentless promotion and the adoption of ESG and climate change plans by many of the most powerful names in finance and industry. Instead of addressing the rampant fraud in carbon credits directly, it appears that the high probability of fraud and insolvency has been seen as an opportunity to create a new market for the insurance industry, with carbon credit insurance being framed as the only \u201cfeasible\u201d means of de-risking the fraud-prone world of carbon markets, which have been criticized by environmental groups and have been shown to have a negligible impact on climate. Lockton offers a variety of products related to carbon credits and so do its competitors, with the first such insurance having been issued by the UK-based insurance company Howden in 2022. That product was designed to \u201cincrease confidence in the Voluntary Carbon Market\u201d and was \u201cincubated\u201d in collaboration with \u201cthe Insurance Task Force of the Sustainable Markets Initiative; an initiative led by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales [now King Charles].\u201d Industry publications have openly posited that carbon credits are likely to be \u201cthe next $1 billion insurance market.\u201d Some companies, like Kita and Oka, were created specifically to insure carbon credits. Presumably, Lockton\u2019s involvement with GREEN+ means that Lockton will be insuring the mass of carbon credits to be produced by the program, which plans to harvest carbon credits from all of the world\u2019s \u201csubnational protected areas.\u201d In addition, Lockton\u2019s role as the carbon credits insurer means it will be involved in ensuring that those cities/regions that are to become part of GREEN+ comply with the program\u2019s stipulations in order to receive funds from the trust. RootstockLabs (RSK) Another member of the GREEN+ Trust is RSK, or Rootstock. RSK is a federated sidechain built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows smart contract functionality akin to the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the same programming language known as Solidity. In effect, this means that any smart contract that can be designed and authored on Ethereum, such as identity systems, dollar-pegged stablecoins, or tokenized carbon credits, can be \u201ctrivially\u201d ported to Bitcoin. The concept of Bitcoin sidechains was first introduced in October 2014 by a group of Bitcoin developers mainly employed by Blockstream, whose November 2014 seed round was led by Reid Hoffman, that gives \u201cbitcoins and other ledger assets\u201d the ability to be \u201ctransferred between multiple blockchains\u201d giving new functionality to \u201cassets they already own\u201d without compromising any of the security innate to Bitcoin's blockchain. RSK works by allowing users to deposit funds sent using traditional bitcoin transactions into a wallet controlled by a federation (in this case, a known group of Rootstock-selected key signers) that issues a 1:1 token called Smart Bitcoin, represented by RBTC, which fuels the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine), a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). RBTC is \u201cthe native currency\u201d of Rootstock, and is used to pay for the fees required to complete and settle the smart contracts or transactions that take place on the RSK sidechain. RSK was launched in 2015 by RSK Labs, which was acquired by RIF Labs before becoming IOV (\u201cinternet of value\u201d) Labs. IOV labs, as of last week, has rebranded once again to become RootstockLabs. It was co-founded by Sergio Lerner, who became the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s bitcoin core security auditor the same year he conceived of RSK, and Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar. Gutierrez is the current chairman of RootstockLabs, while Lerner is its chief scientist and they are the president and vice president, respectively, of the IOV Foundation, which enables \u201cinterventions that contribute to sustainable development,\" specifically the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on emerging markets and territories. A major goal of the SDGs is to create a new global financial governance system. That system has been described in recent years by top UN climate finance official, central banker, and ex-Goldman Sachs executive Mark Carney, as relying largely on programmable, surveillable digital currencies (namely central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs) and a global carbon market. According to RootstockLabs and its affiliated foundation, the group\u2019s mission is to harness \u201cthe power of digital technology, blockchain, and collaboration\u201d to \u201cbreak down barriers and create a more equitable society.\u201d They also state that Rootstock Labs was created with the intent of creating \u201ca new open financial ecosystem,\u201d while RIF Labs states it (along with RootstockLabs) is \u201ccreating a global financial system that works for everyone.\u201d Wences Casares - July 2018 Diego Gutierrez is a long-time associate of Wenceslao (Wences) Casares, an Argentine tech entrepreneur sometimes referred to as the \u201cPeter Thiel of Latin America.\u201d Gutierrez worked with Casares at Argentina\u2019s first Internet service provider, which Casares had launched, and then helped create the Casares-founded Argentinian online brokerage firm Patagon that was later sold to Spanish banking giant Santander. Casares, like Gutierrez, is a long-time promoter and early adopter of Bitcoin and is allegedly responsible for pitching the promise of Bitcoin to elites, like Bill Gates and LinkedIn/PayPal\u2019s Reid Hoffman. Hoffman once referred to Casares as Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d in terms of Silicon Valley\u2019s interest in Bitcoin. Forbes has even referred to Casares as \u201ccrypto royalty who ran with the original gang of Bitcoin OGs.\u201d Casares subsequently became a board member of PayPal and also part of Facebook\u2019s failed stablecoin project Libra/Diem. He is also a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. Casares was formerly a partner at NXTP Ventures, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Latin America, and he is credited with introducing the firm\u2019s founders to crypto. NXTP subsequently became a major investor in Gutierrez\u2019s RSK as well as another Gutierrez-founded company, Koibanx, a Latin America-focused asset tokenization company that \u2013 per its CEO \u2013 is at the \u201cforefront of redefining Latin America\u2019s financial system.\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s Koibanx has been instrumental in developing Bitcoin products and services sponsored by El Salvador\u2019s government as well as enabling the role of Algorand as an intermediary in El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin ecosystem. Algorand is also a major investor in Koibanx and is currently run by Staci Warden, who aided the cronyist privatization of Russia while at Harvard, oversaw J.P. Morgan\u2019s division of emerging market government debt and led crypto-related initiatives and \u201cglobal market development\u201d for the Institute of the mastermind of the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal, Michael Milken. Gutierrez\u2019s Koibanx has also launched a blockchain-based digital ID in Colombia with over 12 million users and is partnered with Nigeria\u2019s government on a crypto initiative where Nigerians can exchange their intellectual property (IP) for a \u201cstable token\u201d considered \u201cequivalent to the Naira,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s currency that has been completely taken over by the government\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. Both of those projects have also been conducted jointly with Algorand. Algorand is a member alongside PayPal and Amazon of the Digital Monetary Institute, which works with central banks, major commercial banks, and Big Tech firms to \u201cexamine the distribution and use cases of both retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies, tokenised assets, deposits and capital markets, cross-border payments and domestic interoperability.\u201d The DMI also focuses on \u201ccrypto assets and stablecoins.\u201d NXTP is also an investor in Ripio, an Argentina-based crypto firm partnered with the World Economic Forum. Rootstock co-founder Sergio Lerner sits on the board of Ripio\u2019s P2P lending subsidiary, the Ripio Credit Network (RCN). Ripio is backed by Tim Draper, who is on the board of the Netanyahu family-founded crypto company Bancor, Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, and Argentina\u2019s richest man Marcos Galperín. Galperín also sits on the board of GREEN+ partner and intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Galperín is intimately connected to the \u201cemerging market\u201d entrepreneurial network known as Endeavor, the board of which is chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr. and includes Reid Hoffman. Both the Bronfman family and Hoffman have considerable ties to sex trafficker and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein. Wences Casares was previously on Endeavor\u2019s board and still maintains ties with the group. Ripio is also an Endeavor-backed company. Marcos Galperin at the World Economic Forum Galperín\u2019s company, Mercado Libre, is considered the first Endeavor success story, and Galperín sits on the board of Endeavor\u2019s Argentina branch alongside controversial Argentinian oligarchs, like former George Soros protégé Eduardo Elzstain. Galperín\u2019s Mercado Libre is deeply interconnected with PayPal as well as Paxos, the stablecoin issuer creating PayPal\u2019s stablecoin, PYUSD. Mercado Libre\u2019s Mercado Pago subsidiary, Ripio and Brazil\u2019s Mercado Bitcoin (another Endeavor/Mercado Libre-connected company) collectively dominate crypto use in South America, especially its biggest markets \u2013 Argentina and Brazil. Diego Gutierrez\u2019s RSK and Wences Casares\u2019 Xapo, a crypto-focused bank founded in 2014 with a long-standing interest in Bitcoin and stablecoin providers, share a common tie in Joey Garcia, who is on the board of both companies. Garcia is also listed as being Xapo\u2019s Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer. Garcia is a lawyer for and head of the fintech team at the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas, which is also part of the GREEN+ group and manages the GREEN+ Trust alongside RSK and Lockton. Both Xapo and RSK\u2019s parent, Rootstock Labs, are based in Gibraltar \u2013 a UK overseas territory, where Garcia helped develop and lobby for crypto regulations with hopes of having that regulatory regime influence coming regulations in the US and Europe. Garcia is also connected to UN initiatives on digital currencies, with a focus on regulation and law enforcement. The involvement of this network in GREEN+ speaks to an effort to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain in the creation of a new global financial system centered around digital currencies and carbon markets. As carbon markets have developed, it has become clear that the carbon market which central and commercial bankers wish to build (with UN backing) will be blockchain-based and that carbon credits will be tokenized and traded on digital exchanges, such as the Goldman Sachs and Blackstone-backed Xpansiv, which is partnered with GREEN+ members Cercarbono and EcoRegistry. There are efforts to make Bitcoin the blockchain on which these markets (or at least key parts of them) will run, hence the relatively recent effort to create a more \u201csustainable\u201d and \u201cnet zero\u201d Bitcoin. RSK is clearly part of this effort, as evidenced by their involvement in GREEN+, where they are managing the smart contracts of GREEN+ carbon credits, as well as their partnership with the California Energy Commission and GREEN+ member The Energy Coalition on creating \u201can experimental market for carbon credit trading\u201d on top of Bitcoin. The importance of RSK within the maturation of the carbon credit market in the blockchain era is two-fold; the direct and immediate interoperability between tokenized assets representing green finance instruments and bitcoin, and the leveraging of the most distributed and most secure blockchain in the world, Bitcoin, as a universal ledger for the execution and settlement of otherwise impossible smart contracts. Rootstock allows Bitcoin the protocol to become the enabling and enforcing environment for all aspects of climate capitalism \u2013 green bond authoring and settlement, parametric insurance clauses, the tokenization of carbon emission offsets, and the issuance of dollar stablecoins that denominate the entire system and globalize the US Treasury market. Diego Gutierrez of RootstockLabs As recently mentioned, Diego Gutierrez of RSK was a very early adopter and promoter of Bitcoin and today runs Bitcoin Argentina while also being a co-founder of Latin America\u2019s largest and oldest Bitcoin conference. In an interview with Argentinian outlet La Voz early last year, Gutierrez stated that, in order for Bitcoin to become part of the global financial system that is emerging, there would have to be a \u201ctrade off\u201d that would mean stripping Bitcoin of its \u201cethos\u201d and \u201cpart of its disruptive potential.\u201d In other words, in Gutierrez\u2019s view, Bitcoin must cease to be a threat to central and commercial banks as it integrates into the system those banks have designed and uphold and will become their tool. There is perhaps no greater evidence of this than the recent pivot of BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink on Bitcoin and its promise as a \u201ctechnology for asset storage\u201d and the wild success of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. Gutierrez also tellingly stated in the same interview that there would soon be a move away from fiat and fiat-backed stablecoins to commodity-backed stablecoins that would make the companies and entities that control those commodities (which would include carbon in this emerging financial paradigm) more powerful than central banks and eliminate the need for central banks entirely. Wences Casares, Gutierrez's close associate, created his bank Xapo to help \u201csolve the disjointed nature of our world economy\u201d and to act as \u201cthe bridge between bitcoin, US dollars and stablecoins.\u201d As a consequence, Xapo has been a key player in efforts to dollarize bitcoin and has developed close relationships with Circle (USDC), Tether (USDT) and Lightspark, whose founder David Marcus invested in Xapo while head of PayPal. Marcus also previously worked for Facebook and co-created Facebook\u2019s Libra/Diem stablecoin project, where Casares was on the board and which was allied with Xapo. Xapo\u2019s initial advisory board was composed of former longtime head of Citibank John Reed, Visa founder Dee Hock and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. Summers is best known for his close association with Jeffrey Epstein and his role in repealing key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act at Citi\u2019s behest, which is widely believed to have provoked the 2008 financial crisis. While on Xapo\u2019s board, Summers became a leading voice behind the effort to \u201cput a price on carbon\u201d and implement carbon taxes and carbon markets. In 2015, together with these men, Xapo claimed, they would build \u201cthe global bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d The GREEN+ Registry Working closely with the GREEN+ Trust is the carbon credit certification standard chosen by GREEN+, Cercarbono. In addition to certifying the carbon credits produced by the program, Cercarbono also has a role in choosing which initiatives participating jurisdictions can implement with funds received and are also involved in fund custody alongside the GREEN+ Trust. Cercarbono was launched in 2016, shortly after Colombia \u2013 where Cercarbono was formed \u2013 passed a law establishing a carbon tax. Cercarbono\u2019s founders created the company because the law created a \u201cneed for a national certifying entity that would provide solutions to the climate problem.\u201d Further Colombian legislation in 2017 spurred the company to expand into carbon markets. It has since become a leading voluntary carbon credit certifier in Latin America. In 2018, Cercarbono formed a partnership with EcoRegistry, a blockchain registry that is also part of GREEN+ and \u201cdevelops services and platforms for reporting, monitoring and registering environmental assets and carbon units.\u201d The program says the company also \u201caddresses the issuance, monitoring and cancellation of the carbon credits generated by the jurisdictions in close coordination with the certification standard and the Trust Fund.\u201d EcoRegistry provides a unique serial number to each carbon credit issued and allows for close monitoring of that credit on-chain. As a consequence, it works closely with the lead of GREEN+\u2019s monitoring unit, the intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic. EcoRegistry is also a part of the Climate Action Data Trust, or CAD Trust. The CAD Trust was discussed in previous reporting from Bitcoin Magazine and Unlimited Hangout and is an effort led by the World Bank and funded by Google (among others) in an effort to construct what they refer to as \u201cclimate wallets.\u201d IETA, discussed below, is also a member of the CAD Trust. Tokenized, Inc. The World Bank has been exploring tokenization and digital ledger technology in order to create \u201ca modular and interoperable end-to-end digital ecosystem for the carbon market.\u201d Through the Digital for Climate (D4C) working group, the World Bank aims to build \u201cthe next generation of climate markets\u201d by directing governments to create National Carbon Registries reliant on blockchain technology. The data produced by these registries will be \u201clink[ed], aggregat[ed] and harmoniz[ed]\u201d by the CAD Trust. D4C itself leverages the Chia blockchain, developed by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen. Part of the D4C\u2019s \u201cClimate Tokenization Suite\u201d includes the aforementioned Climate Wallet to facilitate the exchange of carbon credit tokens, requiring an active connection to a Climate Action Data Trust node to function. EcoRegistry is also part of the Climate Chain Coalition, whose other members include disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann\u2019s new venture Flowcarbon, the Cardano Foundation, the Google-backed oracle service Chainlink, and the Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), which seeks to \u201cencourage [bitcoin] miners to utilize environmentally friendly energy sources using tokenization.\u201d The SBP aims to turn \u201csustainability into an investable asset\u201d when they create what they refer to as a Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate (SBC), a verified \u201con-chain environmental asset\u201d representing \u201cbitcoin mined using clean energy.\u201d The SBP website further specifies the incentivized opportunity for additional revenue streams for Bitcoin miners, stating that \u201cunlike carbon credits or RECs which are retired,\" each individual SBC is a tokenized asset which \u201cpermanently represents the sustainability of one bitcoin.\u201d Due to an upcoming 50% reduction in the rate of bitcoin issued per block \u2013 referred to as a \u201chalving\u201d \u2013 alternative sources of income for miners can be the difference between thriving and barely surviving in such an unforgiving market. While initially issued alongside the mining of every new bitcoin, the SBC itself can later be sold to other investors. Depending on future regulations of energy in relation to Bitcoin mining operations in the United States, non-mining businesses might look to purchase these certificates from miners as a means to offset the carbon footprint of their bitcoin holdings. In effect, the SBP aims to incentivize carbon neutrality for Bitcoin miners while simultaneously allowing investors to meet ESG goals while holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, the latter exemplified in their partnership with Bitcoin custodian BitGo. Their website explains that they \u201cbelieve Bitcoin has a unique potential to expedite the clean energy transition\u201d and due to being \u201cthe world\u2019s first commodity derived from a network,\u201d every bitcoin mined is \u201cfully fungible in both price and also carbon footprint\u201d \u2013 culminating in a \u201csustainability opportunity unlike any other industry.\" If a large company with a large carbon output due in large part to the sheer energy demands of being a multi-national company \u2013 traveling employees, large scale data centers, and simply offices that require electricity \u2013 was holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, they could purchase large amounts of SBCs to source yield on the appreciating certificate token while also generating accounting opportunities to reach metric-based ESG goals faster. The co-founder of SBP, Matthew Twomey, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, OSL and Deutsche Bank, while Head of Climate Strategy Elliot David previously held positions at the US Department of Energy, as well as worked with the Clinton Foundation within their Clinton Climate Initiative on their Island Energy Program. Listed among the SBP Advisors are Natasha Barrientos (S&P Global and the United Nations), Dr. Julia Nesheiwat (the Atlantic Council), Emma Todd (World Economic Forum) and Kelvin Chang (Coinbase and Microsoft). Cercarbono and EcoRegistry share several noteworthy partners and affiliations. For example, both are members of Asocarbono, an alliance of different companies and actors running or supporting Colombian carbon markets, that has written about the issue of \u201ccarbon rights\u201d within voluntary carbon markets. According to the UN, \u201ccarbon rights\u201d \u201ccomprises two fundamental concepts: 1) the property rights to sequester and store carbon, contained in land, trees, soil, etc. and 2) the right to benefits that arise from the transfer of these property rights (i.e. through emissions trading schemes).\u201d The issue itself portends the possibility that those who purchase carbon credits will obtain the \u201cproperty rights\u201d of the carbon sequestered in trees and other natural elements found in the area tied to those carbon credits, opening the door to land grabs through carbon markets. Notably, there is no clear definition of carbon rights and it is unclear, due to the fact that their contracts with jurisdictions/governments are not publicly available, how GREEN+ views the issue of carbon rights in relation to property rights. Source: AirCarbon. Note: Prices on October 7, 2022. EcoRegistry and Cercarbono are also both partnered with AirCarbon Exchange (ACX), \u201cthe world's first fully digital carbon exchange,\u201d established in 2019 with the Singapore Sustainable Energy Association \u2013 subsidized by the Singapore government's Enterprise Singapore \u2013 and backed by the UN. ACX was founded by CEO Thomas McMahon, an over 30 year veteran of the commodities and derivatives industry, having spent over 20 years at the New York Mercantile Exchange before establishing himself in Singapore, where ACX is based. ACX is Singapore's first international carbon credit exchange, chosen by McMahon \u201cdue to demand for carbon credits from the airline industry.\u201d The exchange uses distributed ledger technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain, to trade six different tokenized carbon credits, boasting settlement for \u201cas low as $3 per 1,000 CO2 tonnes.\u201d While ACX began mainly by focusing on the airline industry, the exchange now has over 160 clients ranging from financial institutions to project developers. Between January and August 2021, over 5.7 million CO2 tonnes were traded on the exchange. Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, acquired a 20% stake in the company, with the intent to build a carbon exchange in the UAE. ACX is also partnered with IETA (more on them below), as well as the Carbon Business Council, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). It can be assumed that ACX will be the exchange on which GREEN+ carbon credits will be traded due to its partnerships with GREEN+\u2019s credit certifier and registry. Both Cercarbono and EcoRegistry were also recently integrated into Xpansiv, which \u201coperates the leading multi-registry, multi-asset environmental portfolio management system and market data service\u201d as well as CBL, the \u201clargest spot exchange for environmental commodities, including carbon credits and renewable energy certificates.\u201d Xpansiv is backed by Blackstone, which poured $400 million into the company, with other investors including British Petroleum (BP) Ventures, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Xpansiv\u2019s CBL has partnered extensively with CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group, which is one of the world\u2019s main derivatives exchanges, and together they have produced several futures contracts on carbon markets. Cercarbono and EcoRegistry also both share an affiliation with the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA. Founded in 1999 under the auspices of the UN, IETA \u201cis dedicated to the establishment of linked trading systems to ensure efficient and competitive GHG [greenhouse gas] markets.\u201d Its inaugural members included the titans of the oil and manufacturing industries. Current members include AngloAmerican mining, Saudi Aramco, Bank of America, Bayer/Monsanto, Cargill, Chevron, Citi Group, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, PetroChina and the Mossad-linked commodities company Glencore. Another company that is a member of IETA is StoneX, which is partnered with the aforementioned exchange ACX and is sponsoring the launch of GREEN+ satellites in Miami later this month. IETA is also part of the aforementioned Climate Action Data Trust, along with EcoRegistry, the World Bank and others. IETA is also notably behind the ICROA accreditation program, which Cercarbono and most other carbon credit certification standards of note have received. These include the world\u2019s leading carbon credit certifier Verra, which was recently embroiled in a major scandal when it was revealed that 90% of their most common category of carbon credits were \u201cworthless\u201d despite being ICROA (and IETA) approved. Satellogic Satellogic - Observation Is Preservation As the digital carbon credit industry grows into a multi-trillion dollar market upheld by smart contracts on a distributed ledger, so too does the need for participants to access metric-specific data to insure the eventual pay outs of green bonds. For example, the company Atos, best known for its Olympic Games IT partnership since 1989, raised $916 million in sustainability-linked bonds at the end of 2021. According to a press release in November 2021, the bonds were issued with \u201can eight-year maturity and one percent coupon,\u201d with a clause that the annual interest rate paid during the \u201clast three years will be unchanged if the company reduces its annual GreenHouse Gas CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 & 3) by 50 percent in 2025 compared to 2019.\u201d While these particular bonds were not authored using a blockchain, there remains the now-sudden economic incentive \u2013 a one percent coupon on nearly $1 billion \u2013 to deliver verifiable real world data to the participants, the state of which determines the eventual payout. These bonds were issued with BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan acting as Global Coordinators and with Joint Bookrunners such as HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Banco Santander, Bank of America Securities, and Wells Fargo Securities, among others, with Rothschild & Co \u201cacting as financial advisor to Atos SE.\u201d An article from Data Center Dynamics on the raise makes note of the common trend of \u201csustainability-linked financing\u201d among data center and communication firms, referencing how NTT, Aligned, Airtrunk, KPN, Baidu, and Nabiax all raised \u201cfunds or converted existing debt to include interest rates tied to sustainability and ESG goals\u201d within the last year. Atos and techUK When the eventual payout of billions of dollars in cleverly-authored green bonds comes down to accurate measurements of carbon molecule density over a vast land mass, such as a South American rainforest, the market for reliable data service providers has quite literally left the atmosphere. As the debt instruments of the private sector evolve alongside the proliferation of blockchain technology, the data that makes these smart contracts execute to eventually settle the issued bond no longer goes to a human arbitrator, but rather a consciousness-free protocol that reduces a pair of potential outcomes to a single output. In the case of a sustainability-linked green bond, if the carbon emissions of a business are not empirically reduced beyond a relative metric at a certain time \u2013 both data points of which are determined at the issuance of the smart contract and thus willingly agreed-upon by both parties \u2013 the coupon on the bond is not paid out. With the carbon credit market presenting itself as one of the preferred debt instruments of the modern era, the aforementioned Satellogic \u2013 an intelligence-linked company focused on privatizing the data from satellite surveillance with an advisory board full of key players in the digital debt system \u2013 finds itself ready to act as a crucial pillar of the encroaching new financial system. Emiliano Kargieman of Satellogic Satellogic was co-founded in 2010 by Emiliano Kargieman, its current CEO, and Gerardo Richarte, its current CTO, after spending \u201csome time\u201d at the NASA Ames Campus in Mountain View, CA. According to press releases on their website, Satellogic is \u201cthe first vertically integrated geospatial company\u201d that is building \u201cthe first scalable, fully automated EO [Earth Observation] platform\u201d with capabilities to \u201cremap the entire planet at both high-frequency and high-resolution\u201d in order to generate \u201caccessible and affordable solutions for customers.\u201d Their listed mission is \u201cto democratize access to geospatial data through its information platform of high-resolution images and analytics\u201d to help solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems\u201d of which they list \u201cclimate change, energy supply, and food security.\u201d Other Satellogic documentation reveals that by \u201cdemocratize,\" they mean expand satellite surveillance from the public sector (i.e. governments and security agencies) into the private sector. Due to their \u201cpatented Earth imaging technology,\u201d Satellogic \u201cunlocks the power of EO\u201d to deliver \u201chigh-quality, planetary insights\u201d at \u201cthe lowest cost in the industry.\u201d Both Kargieman and Richarte previously worked for Core Security Technologies, which Kargieman co-founded, with clients such as Apple, Cisco, Homeland Security, NSA, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and DARPA. In 1998, Core Security was recognized as an \"Endeavor Entrepreneur\" by the Endeavor Foundation and in 2002, Morgan Stanley invested $1.5 million into Core Security, with the bank gaining a seat on the board. The company was also funded by Bank of America in its Series A. Kargieman later founded Aconcagua Ventures in a joint venture with Craig Cogut\u2019s Pegasus Capital, and served as a Member of the Special Projects Group at the World Bank. As previously noted, Cogut\u2019s Pegasus Capital is also a main funder of CC35. Another Core Security Technologies employee that migrated to Satellogic with Kargeiman and Richarte is Aviv Cohen, a former Israeli intelligence officer who is now Satellogic\u2019s head of \u201cspecial projects.\u201d Satellogic's seed round raise was funded by Ariel Arrieta and NXTP Ventures, Starlight Ventures \u2013 which Kargieman advises \u2013 and Santiago Pinto Escalier of Endeavor. As stated earlier in this article, NXTP is a funder of GREEN+ member Rootstock as well as the tokenization firm created by Rootstock\u2019s co-founder, Koibanx. Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns a significant stake in Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, invested in Satellogic\u2019s Series A as did Endeavor Catalyst, which is run by LinkedIn/PayPal\u2019s Reid Hoffman, and Valor Capital. Valor Capital, whose partners include figures tied to US military and intelligence activities in Latin America as well as CBDC development on the continent, invested in Satellogic\u2019s Series B, again joined by Tencent, with the Inter-American Development Bank (mentioned more than once in this article) joining in the company\u2019s Series C funding round. In July 2021, Satellogic went public with a $1.1 billion valuation through a \u201cmerger with Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s CF Acquisition Corp. V,\u201d with J.P. Morgan serving as the \u201cexclusive financial advisor to Satellogic,\u201d with a \u201cconcurrent PIPE offering of $100 million led by SoftBank\u2019s SBLA Advisers Corp\u201d alongside Cantor Fitzgerald and \u201cother top-tier institutional investors,\u201d including former US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin's Liberty Strategic Capital. Mnuchin\u2019s recently created venture capital firm, along with Softbank, are major investors in Cybereason, a controversial company tied to Israeli intelligence that previously simulated the hacking of US critical infrastructure in order to cancel a US presidential election and spur the declaration of martial law. Mnuchin\u2019s firm also includes Trump\u2019s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and previously attempted to recruit former Mossad director Yossi Cohen, who instead went on to join Softbank. Joseph Dunford, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump who is now senior managing director of Mnuchin\u2019s firm, is on the advisory board of Cybereason while Mnuchin is on its board of directors. Both Mnuchin and Dunford simultaneously sit on the board of Satellogic and Mnuchin is Satellogic\u2019s chairman. Satellogic Board of Directors Satellogic\u2019s board also includes Howard Lutnick, longtime head of Cantor Fitzgerald (as well as Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s neighbor and a major Clinton donor); Marcos Galperin, the founder and CEO of MercadoLibre who is closely associated with Endeavor, a Satellogic funder; Former Facebook and Twitter lawyer turned venture capitalist Ted Wang; Tom Killalea, former Chief Information Security Officer and Vice President of Security for Amazon who is also on the board of Capital One; and Miguel Gutiérrez, a Partner and a Co\u2010Chief Investment Officer at The Rohatyn Group. Gutiérrez previously worked with Nicholas Rohatyn at J.P. Morgan, where Rohatyn positioned the bank to become a leader in taking ownership of distressed government debt in the 1980s and 1990s, with a focus on Latin America. Gutiérrez was involved with J.P. Morgan\u2019s debt markets in Argentina, before becoming its head of Latin America Emerging Markets and later head of Global Emerging Market Sales. The press release about Satellogic\u2019s SPAC paints a clear picture of the hefty value proposition behind the public offering, which boasts that Satellogic is the \u201cproven leader in Earth Observation\u201d with \u201c17 commercial satellites\u201d currently in orbit, more than \u201cthe next four Earth Observation companies combined.\u201d The satellite company's vertical product stack offers \u201cenhanced analytics capabilities\u201d with \u201ccommercial, sustainability, and government applications\u201d by providing a \u201clive catalog\u201d daily of \u201cevery square meter of Earth,\u201d providing \u201cvital information to power the conversation around global challenges\u201d such as \u201cclimate change, water and energy use, and food supply.\u201d In the SPAC press release, Cantor\u2019s Howard Lutnick stated that \u201cSatellogic is uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry. Its technology, data, and analytics have vast use cases across countless industries.\u201d Kargieman echoed these remarks: \u201cWe think this is a winner takes most or winner takes all market. This is a supply limited market \u2013 governments just can\u2019t get enough data today; there\u2019s not enough satellites out there.\u201d This is also true for the private sector. Satellogic showed CNBC a then-current investor deck which exemplified the true economic potential of dominating \u201cthe Earth Observation industry.\u201d Kargieman noted that the company had completed \u201ca pilot program\u201d with \u201ca major oil and gas corporation,\u201d in which the company required surveillance data for \u201cabout 1,800 miles of pipeline every other week.\u201d Doing this visual audit with airplanes \u201ccost about $750 per mile,\u201d whereas Satellogic \u201cdemonstrated similar detection capabilities\u201d for less than $60 per mile. While Satellogic failed to clear $0 of revenue in 2020, the company was expecting to see that \u201ctick up\u201d due to new contracts that began generating revenue in the spring of 2021. According to an investor slide deck, the company had a backlog of about $38 million in signed contracts around when they went public, but was predicting \u201c$800 million in opportunities over the next two years.\u201d In their full year 2022 financial results update, Satellogic CEO Kargieman tallied \u201c34 satellites in orbit\u201d making \u201cthe largest commercial fleet of sub-meter resolution satellites\u201d and thus \u201cwell positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Earth Observation data and satellites.\u201d Kargieman claimed their revenue grew \u201c42% year-over-year\u201d due in large part to their \u201cAsset Monitoring\u201d and \u201cConstellation-as-a-Service\u201d businesses. Satellogic's new Space Systems, or satellite sales business, \u201ccreates a satellite purchase program that aims to lower the financial barrier to Earth Observation spacecraft ownership\u201d according to CFO Rick Dunn. \u201cSpace Systems is designed to offer governments asset ownership to enhance national geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) with global tasking autonomy... Going forward, revenue will be driven by our continued growth in Asset Monitoring.\u201d Luciano Giesso, Sales Director for Satellogic has stated that Latin America is \u201can area of focus for us.\u201d He explained a current trend of Latin America being \u201cincreasingly focused on space technologies\u201d in order to \u201ccreate new infrastructures\u201d that \u201cunlock the benefits of satellite data\u201d throughout multiple industries. The press release states Satellogic's position is informed by their view that \u201ccountries unequipped with their own satellites\u201d are thus \u201climited in their ability\u201d to meaningfully \u201ccapture data about their policy implementation and infrastructure.\u201d Satellogic\u2019s Dedicated Satellite Constellation Program is specifically marketed as a product for \u201cstrategic national interests\u201d allowing \u201cgovernments of all sizes\u201d to create \u201cunique earth-observation programs\u201d to \u201csupport key decisions and manage policy impact, measure investment and socio-economic progress, and foster collaboration, data and information sharing, and innovation.\u201d The stated mission of Satellogic is to privatize and monopolize Earth Observation in the form of satellite surveillance sold as a service to both the public and private sectors. Palantir, a private sector intelligence firm led by PayPal founder Peter Thiel and created with CIA funds to replace a controversial DARPA mass surveillance and data-mining program, committed to a five year strategic partnership wth Satellogic. Satellogic's partnership with Palantir enables its \u201cgovernment and commercial customers\u201d, which include the CIA and J.P. Morgan, access to Satellogic\u2019s Aleph platform APIs to feed raw satellite imagery to Palantir\u2019s MetaConstellation and Edge AI. This partnership builds on a previous collaboration between Satellogic and Palantir to \u201cfield unique AI capabilities to the orbital edge,\u201d including \u201clive upgrades to the satellite\u2019s onboard AI\u201d that enables \u201can ultra-low-latency maritime use-case.\u201d Palantir and Satellogic customers, which include the Pentagon's Space Systems Command, Space Force, SpaceX, the government of India, and others, will soon have access to the Edge AI platform running on Satellogic satellites \u201cto offer customers tailored AI insights\u201d which is expected to increase Satellogic\u2019s business of \u201cdata products, streamline pipeline management, and further scale customer delivery required for weekly and daily world remaps.\u201d Palantir \u201cThe holistic capabilities of Palantir\u2019s Foundry will be instrumental in helping Satellogic realize our mission to improve life on Earth through geospatial data,\u201d commented Matthew Tirman, President of Satellogic North America. Tirman later made note that within this agreement, Satellogic will provide \u201cPalantir\u2019s US government customers\u201d with access to \u201chigh-resolution satellite imagery\u201d which will \u201cdrive analytical insights across a range of mission-oriented use cases.\u201d Other notable private-public sector partnerships of Satellogic include the Endeavor-funded SkyLoom, which in late 2021 partnered with Honeywell to \u201cproduce laser crosslinks\u201d for both commercial and military satellites, including for the Pentagon\u2019s Space Development Agency, as well as with CIA contractor Amazon Web Services, to facilitate the \u201c50 gigabytes of data per day\u201d per satellite, which \u201cbeams to Earth with the help of the Amazon.com Inc. unit\u2019s AWS Ground Station service.\u201d While it is surely a profitable venture, what Satellogic truly enables is venture capital access to high resolution data of every single square meter on Earth. Space surveillance as a service allows the operators themselves to fill up on up-to-date information of the world's industry, energy use, transportation, commodity storage, and asset consumption \u2013 information that could influence a firm's decision while playing in the private markets. It could also be used by the public-private partnership engineering global technocratic policies that seek to limit consumption, industrialization and energy use by the public and enforce them via space. Outside of this metric-driven advantage, the aforementioned transition to a universal ledger upholding and settling the majority of financial (including purely speculative) activity will require obscene amounts of data. If the private sector's so-called commodity-backed, Real World Asset tokens are to take off in any meaningful way, highly reliable satellite imagery will be needed to uphold billions of dollars of value. Any push towards smart contract-derived money representing tangible objects will demand exactly the data Satellogic intends to not only supply but sell as a service \u2013 to any firm, or government. Blockchain - The New Enabling Environment The idea of green finance, in which private firms utilize data and physical elements from the real world to create novel economic instruments such as bonds based on carbon emissions, necessitates government-upheld agreements and eventual court-based litigation as the ability to find consensus, thus acting as the enabling environment, for the settlement of large values of securities between the public and private sector. Regulation and contractual agreements between governments and their commercial sector partners require not just the literal letter of the law, but vetted insurance brokers, data firms, legislative bureaucrats, and various other accredited lawyers to dictate the grounds in which business can be legally conducted. The private-public partnership has become continually blurred by the relaxing of regulation restricting how corporations can influence current and aspiring politicians via campaign fundraising. In turn, this group of purchased public sector employees must repay the corporations responsible for their successful attempts at gaining office, leading to the push for further dissolution of certain laws that prevented their donors from gaining footholds within a once-regulated market. No longer is the public sector primarily beholden to their constituents, but rather their corporate donors. This ongoing dynamic has led to a runaway feedback of legal corruption and conspiracy between these ostensibly delineated sectors. The net result of the public-private partnerships that upholds the CC35, Green+ and Satellogic collaborations is due to the calculated focus on regional governments, thus finding their enabling environment through pacts and treaties at the subnational level. Steve Mnuchin Once larger regulatory \u201cfish are fried,\u201d the fight for further interoperability of digital assets (such as dollar instruments) moves down to the regional governments of the Global South. For example, the regulation allowing US banks to custody digital assets and stablecoins was put forth by former OneWest official and Coinbase VP Brian Brooks while he served as comptroller of the currency under Mnuchin in the Trump administration. Once world governments, local and national, are forced onboard the universal ledger, the enabling environment will trend towards the ledger itself \u2013 a product of the private sector \u2013 and further out of the hands of the public sector. This capturing of the commons by the private sector via a revolving door of public-then-private operators has been done before, such as during the Plaza Accord, the creation of Brady Bonds, the dissolution of Glass-Steagall, the demolition of Enron, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 fiscal response. The intended future of blockchain \u2013 now that US regulators have embraced Bitcoin as an asset and universal ledger \u2013 is to serve as the new enabling environment, complete with its very own digital dollar instruments, most likely backed by US government debt. There are very few people in the world more responsible for the digitization of the dollar than Steve Mnuchin and Howie Lutnick \u2013 the former's VC firm now consists of several members from his stint at the Treasury, while the latter's firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds the securities for Tether, the world's largest dollar-denominated stablecoin that recently crossed $100 billion issued \u2013 and here they are partnering with the richest man in Argentina and the founder of the largest online marketplace (as well as crypto marketplace) in Latin America, Marcos Galperin. The network of firms associated with Galperin's MercadoLibre \u2013 Xapo, Paxos, Circle, Visa, among others \u2013 is rife with board members and venture capital from the \u201cPayPal Mafia,\u201d as well as the Argentine advisor group Endeavor. These powerful organizations, successors to groups like ADELA that spurred the creation of the Club of Rome and chose the winners of Latin America\u2019s corporate landscape, have made it clear that they foresee this fundamental market transition. They have quietly positioned themselves to dominate the main pillars of the new financial system in Latin America and the world at large: regulated banking services, global marketplaces, payment processing, digital asset infrastructure, and capital creation monopolies. As we will see, this financial system is not about \u201cinclusion\u201d or \u201csustainability\u201d as professed, but about using and deepening Latin America\u2019s debt burden to force policy changes while enforcing foreign control over the region\u2019s economic activity and governance, all under the watchful \u201ceyes\u201d of US intelligence-linked satellites.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. With Bitcoin\u2019s next halving set to take place this month, miners are using record profits to adapt their business models for chaotic opportunities. The halving is almost upon us. As the whole world of Bitcoin waits with bated breath for mining rewards to be cut in half, the potential for new revenue streams has left us wondering how the space will react to new market conditions. Halvings in the past have generally been associated with prosperity for Bitcoin, but they\u2019ve also been known to shake up previously-held assumptions in a big way. We\u2019re already seeing a few examples of these market changes; just to name one, the larger miners have been modernizing their equipment to ensure maximally efficient hardware. This has led to a fire sale of outdated equipment from these companies, with many thousands of mining rigs finding their way to aspiring miners in Africa and Latin America. The cheap hydroelectricity from Ethiopia has already been attracting international capital to become a new mining hub, and a large portion of these rigs are going there for pennies on the dollar. In other words, miners are expecting to see less output in the immediate future, but this has nevertheless incentivized the creation of new mining companies worldwide and net growth for the industry. This is just one illustration of the sorts of unexpected opportunities that will take the digital asset space by storm, and it\u2019s up to Bitcoiners to seize on them. For miners as a whole, opportunities are certainly plentiful. March 2024 saw the highest ever monthly revenues for the collective mining industry, just topping $2 billion. This is particularly noteworthy because less than half of this revenue has come from transaction fees, a far cry from the situation in December where transaction fees outpaced mining rewards. In December, the price of Bitcoin was far lower, and the blockchain was plagued with congestion. Not only did this congestion suppress the demand for buying Bitcoin, but it also raised the demand for miners to process the blockchain. Simply resolving transactions on already-mined Bitcoin made up a larger share of profits than mining and selling new ones, and this enterprise became a lifeline for many smaller firms. Now, however, it seems like the money is flowing all around. Bitcoin ETFs are gobbling up Bitcoin at extreme rates\u2014more than 6x the actual output of miners. The bonanza has even brought venture capital interest squarely back into focus, further increasing the frenzy. In the first three months of 2024, major exchanges collectively saw their reserves of Bitcoin drop by nearly $10 billion, revealing the immense demand for newly-mined coins. With market conditions like this, it\u2019s no wonder that miner profits have hit an all-time record. Source However, although this period of intense sales has certainly created an opportunity for the miners, there are also perils associated with the halving. These companies are in a mad dash to secure as much revenue as possible pre-halving, and the race is so desperate for one simple reason: trendlines may give encouraging data, but there\u2019s no actual guarantee that Bitcoin\u2019s price will climb accordingly after its supply is cut down. Halving hype and the runaway success of ETFs have brought Bitcoin\u2019s price to its highest levels, but this record has been followed by volatility. Bitcoin has hovered around its great benchmark ever since passing it without continuing to rally in a bombastic spike. If Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to behave in unexpected ways, it will eventually wreak havoc on smaller firms and promote industry consolidation. Additionally, a particularly interesting development has emerged in the secondary Bitcoin markets. Since the rapacious demand of ETF issuers and other financial institutions has completely outpaced supply, some long-term holders (LTHs) have been awakening to fears of a generalized liquidity crisis. Whales previously content to hold Bitcoin for years at a time have changed their behavior, evidently deciding that now is the time to finally realize massive profits. March 2024 has seen long-term holders begin selling their assets at unprecedented rates, raking in a disproportionate amount of profit in relation to other Bitcoin sellers. Obviously, a resource like this cannot last forever, but it\u2019s an important reminder to some of the miners: just because you\u2019re having trouble making ends meet post-halving, it doesn\u2019t mean the industry is. Adapt, or the space will find new ways to leave you behind. Source Nevertheless, miners big and small have not taken on the challenge of the halving lying down. These runaway profits have enabled businesses to invest in a wide variety of preparation strategies, sometimes even dramatically shaking up their business models. For example, the American firm Arkon Energy has previously operated more as an infrastructure company, viewing itself as a provider for a client base of independent miners. As it announced a major purchase of state-of-the-art mining equipment on April 2nd, it joined an industry-wide trend of preparing for the halving with maximally efficient machines. Rather than offering this equipment to its previous clientele, however, Arkon has stated its intention to pivot and simply mine Bitcoin themselves. This simple shift represents a dramatic change in their overall business model, and they plan to follow through by \u201caiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world\u201d. Leading miner Hut 8, on the other hand, has initiated a business model pivot of its own, but in a slightly different direction. A Q1 earnings call in late March saw CEO Asher Genoot acknowledge that 70% of the company\u2019s revenue came from asset mining, but that plans were expected to change somewhat as the halving approaches. Hut 8 is still focusing on upgrading its hardware and exploiting energy resources at new sites, like many other mining companies, but it\u2019s also investing in a new direction. This new direction is not in a different asset, as its mining operations are focused on Bitcoin, but rather in developing high-performance computing and AI operations. Genoot claimed that these new operations were \u201csub-scale today\u2026 But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow.\" He added that \u201cYou\u2019ll see us continuing to be creative in how we maximize the value of every machine,\u201d stressing the need to maintain an eager and disciplined attitude toward the existing mining operations. These are just a couple of the different new strategies that miners are taking to anticipate the halving. Companies have been preparing for months now, and there is still time to make additional new plans. At the time of writing, the halving is in less than three weeks, and the countdown to this event reveals the optimistic and celebratory attitude of Bitcoiners everywhere. No matter what happens when the long-awaited day finally gets here, a few constants seem very reliable. There will be an immense demand for the world\u2019s leading digital asset, and the Bitcoin community will have the same innovative spirit as always. Whether Bitcoin jumps right away or behaves unpredictably, it\u2019s certain that someone will wind up a big winner. For us Bitcoiners, that means there\u2019s plenty to look forward to.","article_summary":"Halving hype and ETF inflows have left Bitcoin miners with all-time profit margins.

GDA, which was founded in 2013 and operates 19 mining facilities across North America, Europe and Central Asia, has entered into a strategic hosting arrangement with Lonestar Dream, developer of immersion cooling systems for bitcoin mining devices, to run the Tarbush operation. \u201cThis hosting agreement is an important milestone for us as we continue expansion in the West Texas region,\u201d said Andrey Kim, CEO of GDA in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. This is the 6th new site in Texas into which GDA has expanded in recent years. The state\u2019s abundance of renewable energy and its flexible power grid have prompted the company to continue expanding in Texas. Tarbush is located within the ERCOT West Hub, which is well-suited for wind and solar energy production. As of Q1 2023, ERCOT, which stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, was the top region for renewable energy generation output across the US, according to S&P Global. And PBS recently acknowledged that Texas, a state once well known for its oil production, is quickly becoming a leader in renewable energy. According to ERCOT, renewable resources like wind and solar normally meet approximately 40% of the energy demand in Texas. During some periods, though, they can meet as much as 75% of the demand. Wind, solar, and a tiny bit of hydro met 75% of power demand in ERCOT today a little after 2:00, a new record. Add in nuclear and the Texas grid was more than 80% emissions-free for most of the afternoon. And again, prices were $0.

Approved earlier this year by the SEC, US spot bitcoin ETFs have rapidly gained traction among investors. Their volumes last month exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. NEW: #Bitcoin ETFs saw a record volume of $111 BILLION in March. That's TRIPLE the inflows from February 🤯 pic.twitter.com/Ol1PaS8vC9 \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 3, 2024 According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, March trading volume was around triple that of February and January. The massive rise indicates spot bitcoin ETFs are meeting strong demand from institutional and retail investors. He stated, \"I can't imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.\" BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack, capturing 50% of the total volume. Grayscale's GBTC took second place with 20%, while Fidelity's FBTC followed at 17%. Balchunas declared IBIT the \"$GLD of bitcoin,\" referring to the mammoth SPDR Gold ETF. He said its March victory makes IBIT the undisputed leader among bitcoin ETFs. The surge in trading activity aligns with Bitcoin's climb to new all-time highs in March. However, it also suggests spot ETFs are altering market dynamics and driving new demand. Critics initially argued bitcoin markets would shrug off the new products. Yet flows into funds like IBIT and FBTC have been overwhelmingly positive. Demand is vastly outpacing bitcoin mined. ETFs bought around 66,000 BTC in March, while miners only produced 28,500. This supply-demand imbalance seems poised to grow as more investors get exposure through ETFs and newly mined coins get cut in half in two weeks during the bitcoin halving event. With strong inflows, assets under management, and trading activity, these new regulated instruments have firmly established themselves within Bitcoin markets. If March was any indication, their rise is only just beginning.","article_summary":"Spot bitcoin ETFs saw record trading volume of $111 billion in March, nearly triple February's total, indicating strong demand for the new products.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/111-billion-bitcoin-etfs-record-inflows-march","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-04-03T17:59:54Z","type":"article","category":["Business"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/111-billion-bitcoin-etfs-record-inflows-march","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU2NDEwNjkxMjY3/wall-street-blockchain-alliance-launches-educational-platform-for-financial-markets.jpg"},{"article_title":"US Government Preparing to Sell 30,000 Silk Road Bitcoin, On-Chain Data Shows","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Today, the US government sent a transaction that appears to indicate it may be on the verge of liquidating the remaining Bitcoin it confiscated from the online marketplace Silk Road. According to on-chain data, a 0.001 BTC test transaction, part of a larger stash of approximately 30,174 BTC worth $2 billion linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace, were moved by the US government. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, received the transaction from these Silk Road-related funds.

It appears the purpose of this transaction is to sell the coins, as it has previously done in the past.

Youssef and the global team at NoOnes are on a mission to end financial apartheid and to unite the financially disenfranchised around the world. In the process, they\u2019re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: What is the primary mission of NoOnes? Ray Youssef: It's the world's first peer-to-peer distributed nation. I see myself as a chief advocate, not just CEO \u2014 someone that is representing the people. We want to onboard a billion citizens in the next six years. By citizens, I mean engaged customers. They're not just using it once every two weeks. They have to be deeply engaged for this to be victorious. That means a billion daily engaged people. It's an amazing number when you consider Binance has 120 million users and about 2-3% of them are probably monthly active. We're trying to get a hundred times that. Corva: How many people are currently using it? Youssef: We have about 400,000 active users, which is pretty amazing. My old company had like a quarter million active [users]. The goal here is not just to get empty signups. The goal here is to make people active. Corva: You\u2019ve talked about how apps like NoOnes and Bitcoin can help end \u201cfinancial apartheid.\u201d Could you define this term? Youssef: Financial apartheid is the most evil form of apartheid. It's invisible chains that have basically kept the vast majority of the world poor for over a hundred years, and people aren't even aware [of it]. It manifests in so many different ways. Broken overregulation [is one form of it]. Africa is the most overregulated region of the world. M-Pesa is the top mobile wallet in Kenya. 98.8% of Kenyans have an M-Pesa wallet. M-Pesa is so big it\u2019s expanded beyond Kenya to Ghana, South African and other African countries, but you still can't send money from an M-Pesa wallet in Kenya to an M-Pesa wallet in Ghana or South Africa. You are trapped in the economy where your passport was issued. You can't access liquidity in other countries, and they can't access liquidity in your country. The problem gets even worse when you consider commerce between companies. Pan-European trade is at 69%. In Asia, I think it\u2019s 59%. Latin America drops down to 30%. And Africa, officially it's at 13%. But guess what? The real number is less than 1%. Because in that 13%, they count all these American and Western corporations that just have local names. Intracontinental African trade is at less than 1%. If that doesn't scream financial apartheid, what does? Corva: Speaking of Africa, let's discuss what's happening in Nigeria. The government took two Binance executives hostage. In response, Binance has stopped supporting the Naira and has shut down its P2P trading platform in Nigeria. NoOnes is currently enabling Binance P2P traders to transfer their P2P trading profiles from Binance to NoOnes. How is this going? Youssef: Traders are very happy to have their feedback imported over. It's very important. Reputation is huge in this business, especially if you're an OTC trader. [So,] we made a special landing page for all the peer-to-peer refugees. They're very happy to come over and be able to talk to the CEO directly in a Telegram and WhatsApp channel. That goes a long way. Binance is being torn apart by the US government right now. Why did they go for this guy (Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance\u2019s former CEO) so hard? Were they angry he was front-running his own users? No. They didn't care about that at all. What they really cared about is that CZ and Binance allowed all of us plebs \u2014 all of us peasants out there \u2014 to have financial access through peer-to-peer trading. The fact that there's 120 million people on the same internal money transmission network and that CZ has all these off ramps to local money all over the world set them off. Remember the guy they came after before CZ? Ross. Corva: Ross Ulbricht? Youssef: Yes, sir. Peer-to-peer is the enemy, and it always has been. They've had Ross in jail for over 11 years. He just put up a website like Amazon or eBay where anyone could trade anyone with anything. [Sure,] some people sold some weed on there. For that, they made up this story about [his involvement in a murder conspiracy]. This is all garbage. This is a sweet, innocent kid. And they put him in jail for two life sentences. Corva: And Sam Bankman-Fried only got 25 years. Youssef: The only reason Sam Bankman-Fried got any time at all was because some rich people lost some money. This is the only reason that Madoff got any time at all. too. If he was robbing poor people, no one would give a damn. But Ross Ulbricht, man, they hit him with everything because they could. They wanted to send a message: \u201cHey, if you try to make global free marketplaces \u2014 real commerce \u2014 happen, we're going to destroy you. You don\u2019t touch that.\u201d And guess what? They\u2019ve done that to bitcoin, [too]. They said, \u201cHey, we\u2019ll let bitcoin exist as a store of value. If you get in good with us, we\u2019re going to give you an ETF ticker. We\u2019re going to get our pension funds in there. We\u2019re going to let the price go up high. You\u2019ll be just a little bit better off than everyone else. But you gotta give up this whole medium of exchange [thing].\u201d We gave up literally the best thing in the world, a free system of real commerce for a store of value for just another get rich quick pump and dump. It\u2019s actually beginning to dawn on all of us: Oh, my goodness. Roger Ver was right. Corva: I was actually just watching an interview with him on The Bitcoin Takeover. He made some interesting points that are in line with what you\u2019re saying. Youssef: I mean, yeah, I was pissing all over Roger with all the other clowns before, too, but the dude is right. We have lost the ethos. We have lost the foundational base for what we're doing. And should they actually manage to keep bitcoin out of the picture as this medium of exchange and just keep it as a store of value, eventually we'll lose everything. If it wasn't for what's happening in the Global South, it's empty. And quite frankly, the Global South has moved over mostly to USDT on Tron. The only nation still [using] bitcoin primarily for a medium exchange is Nigeria. But the truth is, USDT on Tron is way cheaper. It doesn't have volatility. It makes a lot more sense. So, how are we going to compete with that? Corva: That\u2019s a good question. Going back to Nigeria for a moment. NoOnes has team members on the ground who are promoting the platform in the wake of Binance P2P shutting down. Do you ever worry about their safety? How do you deal with the fact that they could easily be targeted? Youssef: Number one, I\u2019d try to get them out of the country. And if we can't do that, then I\u2019d ask them to keep as low of a profile as possible. We also keep something in the bank to represent them legally. I don't want anyone to go to jail for anything I do. I'm not going to play with other people's freedom or safety. But throughout this whole process, everyone's been pooping all over the Nigerian government. They're like, \u201cThese people are dumb,\u201d and that's not helpful. There are some very smart people in the Nigerian government that know exactly what's going on, but they can't tell their own people exactly what's going on because their own people wouldn't be able to handle it or help them. Every time I talk about this on Bloomberg or CNN Africa, I say, \u201cThe governments are not the problem. There is external pressure being applied to them that we're not aware of.\u201d And this is always the case in every one of these situations, whether it's Zimbabwe or Venezuela. I invite the government to talk anytime. Peer-to-peer is not a problem but the solution to actually correcting Nigeria's capital control imbalance. If you go to peer-to-peer traders and say, \u201cWe need you to help us get more American dollars into the government here to stabilize the price of the Naira, they're like, 'Okay, [let\u2019s] do it for Nigeria.'\u201d [However,] they're not going to lose money doing it. They want to make some money doing it. But if they have the choice between doing the right thing to help everyone across a long-term timeline and making a little bit less profit, they'll take that. Believe me, these people are not stupid. They know what's good for the country is good for them, and that should be leveraged. Corva: Speaking of people not being stupid, the team at NoOnes focuses heavily on education. How challenging is educating people on the ground? Youssef: I posted a video on my Twitter of one of our workshops. There were over a thousand people there. That's how much hunger there is for this. Seriously, Education is THE way and #noOnes is absolutely blowing up now !#Bitcoin to the first billion, self custody and p2p. pic.twitter.com/lEGaNlXGSE \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) March 27, 2024 Everyone needs bullish education. What I mean by bullish education is not the one, two, threes, or even how the blockchain works. No one really cares. It's how to make money. People want to change their lives. You can move money around the world to leverage arbitrage. You can start real simple and put up an offer to buy bitcoin cheap on NoOnes and then take it and sell it on another exchange, a local exchange, whether you're in South Africa or Malawi or wherever at 10% plus. That's what some people are doing. One guy I just talked to last week was making $2,000 a month \u2014 just buying bitcoin cheaply and selling it for 9-10% of what he bought it for. He [told me], \u201cThis is how I\u2019m paying my way through college.\u201d He spends just five hours a week doing these trades. There's another dude in South Africa, and he identified a problem. Nigerian workers want to send money back home to mama. They can't do it because they don't have a South African bank account. So he tells them, \u201cDeposit your cash into my South African bank account.\u201d He just takes that cash, buys bitcoin with it, sells that Bitcoin to someone in Nigeria on the NoOnes marketplace and says, \u201cSend a bank transfer to this guy\u2019s mother\u2019s bank account.\u201d He did two peer-to-peer transactions and turned [South African] Rand into a Nigerian bank transfer, and the people on the ground are super happy they didn't have to do it themselves. They just put money in the bank, gave him his mom's bank account number. He did all the work. He's banking and making profit. He started his own remittance corridor. He's basically Western Union for the very specific corridor of South Africa to Nigeria. Corva: These are incredible stories. When I think about NoOnes, I think about people around the world gaining access to bitcoin, not necessarily becoming entrepreneurs using the platform. It\u2019s great to hear that P2P bitcoin trading enables this. Youssef: Absolutely. We are in the middle right now of the peer-to-peer revolution. It started with the internet. We got all these mobile devices and all these startups that disrupted everything except finance. Then, we got peer-to-peer electronic cash. Now, we're fighting for the soul of it as a [medium] of exchange. Peer-to-peer marketplaces are the last step. That's what they put Ross Ulbricht in jail for. That's what they put CZ in cuffs for. They don't want someone actually finishing it, completing the peer-to-peer revolution.

One of the longest running criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not possible to make arbitrary programs to control how money is spent or locked. Bitcoin only has a very limited amount of programmability in its scripting language, and the primitives available are extremely constrained. You can check a signature, you can add a timelock to something, you can manipulate data in a few simple ways, but that\u2019s it. You can program a Bitcoin UTXO to require a signature check, a timelock verification, etc. But you cannot program it to unlock based on any arbitrary conditions. Robin\u2019s insight with BitVM was that one single primitive in the field of computing could be enforced in Bitcoin script: a NAND gate, one of the basic primitives of computing at the physical/electrical level. Every computation that is possible can be constructed out of NAND gates. Script can actually verify a NAND gate due to a neat trick using OP_BOOLAND and OP_NOT. OP_BOOLAND is an AND operation, the opposite of NAND. OP_NOT takes a binary 1 or 0 value and inverts it. This together allows you to actually enforce a single NAND operation in script directly. In combination with hashlocks, a NAND gate script can be made where each input and output field has two possible hashlocks to \u201cunlock\u201d that spending path, each one pushing a 1 or 0 to the stack to perform the NAND operation. Each script also has a path where if you can reveal both preimages to a single bit value, you can immediately claim the funds. This is so that once someone decides what to input to the NAND gate, they cannot change their mind without losing money. A massive amount of NAND gate scripts can all be compacted into a taproot tree, and once someone commits to the bit values off-chain to input to that computation, the other party can challenge them on any individual step in the computation to prove it is being executed correctly on chain. Each \u201cchallenge\u201d allows the challenged party to prove that the individual gate was computed correctly, otherwise the other party can claim the funds after a timelock. Going back and forth like this if a computation is contested, it is guaranteed that the cheating party will eventually be caught and lose funds. The limitations The main limitation of BitVM is that only the people involved in creating a BitVM contract can participate, and the roles are very limited. There is the prover, the person asserting how the computation happened off-chain, and the verifier, the person who can challenge the computation and force it to be proven on-chain if the prover does not complete the computation off-chain or tries to lie about the results. One of the reasons for designing BitVM was to establish two way pegs to sidechains or other systems. The scheme offers a very powerful primitive in that use case, the ability to actually enforce funds be given to one party or the other based on the correctness of an arbitrary computation, i.e. a validity check on whether a pegout is valid according to a sidechains rules. The problem is, only the people who hold keys to that BitVM UTXO can actually go \u201cHey, you\u2019re cheating!\u201d when someone is, and engage in the challenge protocol. This ultimately makes the system still trusted. Another limitation is that the challenge response protocol can be very long. If someone realizes the outcome of the computation is going to result in them losing money and they stop responding, the verifier has to essentially guess where the individual NAND gate is in the computation that the prover would have to lie at and reveal both preimages to a bit that would give the verifier the funds. Until that specific gate is challenged on-chain, the prover can still respond correctly to a challenge and drag it out. This can be very time consuming and inefficient. Some improvements to this design have been made since the original proposal to allow for multiple verifiers to exist in the system with the prover, to create a 1-of-n trust model where only a single verifier is required to challenge a dishonest prover. However, this requires the instantiation of multiple BitVM instances in parallel to accomplish, and therefore increases the inefficiencies with the original two party design. BitVM 2 Robin recently proposed a design scheme for BitVM 2. This scheme seeks to make a few trade offs in comparison to the original design for the benefit of mitigating its two major shortcomings. BitVM 2 shortens the challenge/response protocol length from an indeterminate series of transactions that could be upwards of dozens in the worst case scenario, to two rounds in the challenge/response. In addition to this, with the use of connector outputs it allows anyone to act as a verifier. It does not require someone to be a member involved in establishing the BitVM to challenge a dishonest prover. The fundamental shift here is moving away from directly using script NAND gates to implement the raw computational trace directly, and moving to using them to implement a general SNARK zero knowledge proof verifier (one of the core primitives Robin intended from the start to implement using BitVM). Instead of putting the raw input into the raw computational trace, and running it gate by gate in their own tapleaf scripts, the input of the BitVM 2 instance would simply be a zero knowledge proof input in combination with an asserted output of the computation. In addition to abstracting away the computation implementation with a ZKP, the tapleaf scripts are being massively expanded from a single NAND gate per leaf to an entire sub-function of the ZKP verifier. Instead of the challenge response protocol being based around the verifier guessing at which NAND gate the prover attempted to cheat at, selectively challenging at a single gate, the verifier can prove an entire sub-function\u2019s output is invalid according to the input. Just like BitVM 1, the contract is pre-negotiated using pre-signed transactions and branching scripts. Funds pegged into the BitVM are sent to an n-of-n multisig which signs two possible execution transactions, one in which no challenge occurs, and one in which a challenge occurs. To start the process of executing the contract, the prover initiates a kick off transaction. This kick off transaction commits to the output value \u2018y\u2019 they claim the computation produces, and includes three outputs: a timelocked output that is included in the no challenge execution transaction, a connector output A, and a connector output B, both of which also are spent in the no challenge transaction. Here is where the design allows for anyone to participate as a verifier. Connector output A has a second pre-signed transaction that can spend it, the challenge transaction. This is a pre-signed transaction that pays the prover a bond in bitcoin, but the connector output A is not enough to fund it. Literally anyone can add their own inputs to fund the transaction and spend connector output A, which invalidates the no challenge withdrawal transaction for the prover (one of the inputs it needs no challenge exists). This forces the challenge path. Connector output B is also spendable using a pre-signed transaction, the assert transaction, to the output of every sub-function in the entire BitVM 2 contract. This requires a large transaction with a lot of data, but remember, the ultimate output \u2018y\u2019 the prover is claiming the computation produced was already committed to in the kick off transaction. This creates two outputs. One is a timelocked output, the other is a connector output C. Both of these outputs, in addition to the original pegged in funds, are all spent in the second successful withdrawal transaction for the prover after the timelock. Connector output C is also spendable by anyone who can prove that any sub-function output in the BitVM 2 contract produces an invalid output. This requires a very large transaction, because the script necessary to prove an entire section of the BitVM computation is incorrect is massive, but in this single transaction a verifier can claim the coins in the connector output with a valid proof. This invalidates the second withdrawal transaction for the prover and effectively burns the coins. The only way to recover them at this point is if the prover and all of the verifiers in the original n-of-n funding multisig all cooperate to recover them (in the case of a setup ceremony involving key deletion this recovery possibility does not exist). Connector output B in the kick off transaction can also be spent after a much longer timeout than no challenge withdrawal to invalidate both the no challenge and the assert transaction, burning the pegged coins. This reduces what could be a ridiculous chain of transactions in the original BitVM proposal to enforce the correct contract outcome, to at most four transactions (although admittedly very massive ones), while in the process making the set of verifiers for the BitVM 2 instance literally anyone with bitcoin who will fund the challenge transaction. BitVM 2 could wind up being a significant breakthrough in regards to the wave of rollups and other layer 2s aiming to use BitVM as a two way peg. The operator of a rollup (the prover in the BitVM) can use their own funds to cover withdrawals of users who have pegged into the system, and periodically withdraw those funds from the BitVM to compensate themselves. Any user or interested party would then be able to penalize them by burning their funds if they could produce proof the operator was not processing all withdrawals correctly. It is important to note that ultimately the security of a BitVM 2 instance is backstopped by the n-of-n keyholder, even though people not participating in it can still challenge the prover as a verifier. But because the prover has an efficient exit in the case of no challengers, and anyone can fund the challenge transaction to act as a verifier, the n-of-n funding multisig could follow a setup and key deletion ceremony similar to the Zcash launch to improve its security. BitVM 2 will probably wind up being a significant breakthrough in terms of improving the flexibility and trust model of two way pegs that make use of BitVM. Once again, Robin has proven himself a real wizard.","article_summary":"Robin Linus has recently released a proposal for BitVM 2, offering significant improvements from the original BitVM proposal.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-04-02T21:00:00Z","type":"article","category":["Robin Linus","BitVM","BitVM 2","Technical","Opinion"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NjA0Nzk5MDIyNTkw/default_a_close_up_view_of_the_glowing_lines_of_electricity_su_0.jpg"},{"article_title":"Arkon Energy Orders 27,700 New-Generation Bitcoin Mining Machines from Bitmain","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC, a leading player in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, has placed a significant order with Bitmain Development Pte.

This shatters the previous record of $1.74 billion set back in May 2021. JUST IN: #Bitcoin Miners hit a record $2 billion in monthly revenue, highest ever. Halving coming in hot in 2 weeks 🙌 \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 2, 2024 Of the $2 billion earned last month, around $85 million came from transaction fees, while $1.93 billion was from the block subsidy. (Miners receive compensation both for validating transactions and minting new bitcoins.) The block subsidy, paid out for each block mined, is currently 6.25 bitcoins. But it will drop to 3.125 bitcoins after the upcoming halving event in April. This will cut miner revenue from new bitcoin creation in half unless there is a significant price rise. Higher network activity and increasing bitcoin prices both contributed to miners' bumper revenues in March. The upcoming halving created urgency for miners to maximize earnings before profits are squeezed. The leading US mining pool, Foundry, captured 29.4% of all blocks mined in March. Chinese pool AntPool took second place with 22.4% of blocks. The two captured over half the monthly Bitcoin supply. While miners enjoyed their profit bonanza last month, exchange-traded funds purchasing bitcoins on the open market accumulated even more. ETFs bought roughly 66,000 bitcoins in March, while miners only produced around 25,500. This widening supply-demand imbalance and halving-related scarcity could spur greater competition to secure Bitcoin. The resulting difficulty increases may start pricing out less efficient miners, spurring industry consolidation. With the halving cutting rewards in half in a matter of weeks, miners face an increasingly harsh environment if Bitcoin's price fails to compensate for the drop in issuance. But if history repeats, a strong bitcoin bull run could still be on the horizon, softening the revenue blow of reduced block subsidies.","article_summary":"Bitcoin miners generated a record $2 billion in monthly revenue in March between block rewards and fees, setting a new high ahead of the upcoming halving event.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-04-02T18:58:30Z","type":"article","category":["Business"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5NTIzMTk3NTA5NDQ1MjQ4/what-is-bitcoin-mining.png"},{"article_title":"Tether Adds 8,888 BTC Worth $600 Million to Bitcoin Treasury, On-Chain Data Shows","author":"Vivek Sen","article_detailed_content":"Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million.

Despite facing scrutiny from regulators before the announcement, many people still asked how the biggest exchange in crypto could just disappear from the world\u2019s fastest growing market for Bitcoin adoption. I wasn\u2019t shocked because I\u2019ve been predicting this for years. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are under attack and the frontline is a currency war being played out right before our eyes. I founded NoOnes, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform based in the Global South, because I foresaw the problems facing the crypto industry. Three years ago, I saw this day coming. I knew it was coming because I was the CEO of a Bitcoin company based in the United States, and I saw the financial apartheid and all the regulatory problems up close. American regulators hold Africans in such low regard they make rules to suit Westerners and don\u2019t care too much about anyone else. I knew it would be more and more difficult to serve Africans and the rest of the Global South if my company was based in the US. That\u2019s why I created NoOnes. My only option was to turn my back on a business I had built into a Bitcoin P2P platform with over 10 million users. The problems I saw back then are exploding right now, but blaming governments alone is not the path forward. We must understand the pressures our leaders are under because only when we do that can we come to the table with them to forge a new path ahead. Right now, all we have is a bunch of people cursing each other and that is not the way forward. This war is about the financial system and the power to control the levers that decide whose money is good and whose money is bad. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are trapped in their own markets, so that even making payments or doing business with countries next door is difficult. For the average African entrepreneur to scale any business by expanding outside the African continent, it is basically impossible. And now that Binance has left Nigeria, some businesses based here are wondering what\u2019s next. To be able to truly unlock the potential for Global South entrepreneurs to create value, we have to nurture them and create an environment that allows them to flourish. That\u2019s only possible if we do what I\u2019ve been advocating for years: ensure there is free trade by having a free-flowing money system. Making it happen is not going to be easy, and that\u2019s why I had to make some tough decisions. I had to leave the US, I had to give up a successful company I founded, and I had to start all over again in the Global South. I know why Binance was forced to leave Nigeria, and I\u2019m sure it will happen to other crypto companies and in other countries. It\u2019s almost impossible to run a crypto business or a bitcoin marketplace serving Africa from another continent because you have to be on the ground to see the problems and find the solutions. I knew we couldn\u2019t achieve our mission to help the unbanked if we didn\u2019t have boots on the ground in the Global South, and that\u2019s why we based NoOnes here right from the start. I\u2019m not some mad guy who gave eight years of my life to a company and then left on a whim. I set-up NoOnes so I could be here for this moment. Binance might have pulled-up stakes and gone home, but NoOnes won\u2019t do that \u2013 we are already home. I know Nigeria and I know the Global South because my businesses have been active here for years. We live and work here now, and we listen to what people on the ground tell us. We hired local Africans to handle moderation for Africans, for example, and that\u2019s partly what \u201cboots on the ground\u201d means \u2013 instead of a bunch of Americans passing judgment, we use local Africans to make moderation safer and fairer. We are not looking at Africa \u2013 or any of the Global South where we operate \u2013 as places to plunder. We see Africans as partners and fellow humans. That\u2019s why we created our partner program to share our profits with the people who are part of our business. I\u2019ve met thousands of tech-savvy Nigerian entrepreneurs and I know there is a reason for the high-level of Bitcoin adoption here. For too long they have been shackled by an unfair global financial system, by financial apartheid that creates money prisons and stifles economic growth. Bitcoin and NoOnes give those entrepreneurs the opportunity to show what they can do when markets are free and money is allowed to flow. All they need to grow is a level playing field. They just need a shot, a path towards success, and when we open up any window of opportunity they bust right through it. That\u2019s why NoOnes is not simply creating the best site to buy Bitcoin. We are going all out to give them life-changing opportunities. When I speak in auditoriums around Africa and explain what is possible with Bitcoin and our peer-to-peer platform, I see people\u2019s eyes light up. When I talk to them one-on-one, I am astonished at the amount of hustle and business acumen they have. Our next step is to make it easier for these entrepreneurs to take their business to the next level. We are building a product that will give local entrepreneurs a massive opportunity to build businesses in their own country for their own citizens, and, ultimately, to keep the profits inside their country. Despite the withdrawal of Binance Nigeria, tons of opportunities remain.

The order comes after Wright's decisive loss in a landmark lawsuit against the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). Earlier in March, Judge James Mellor ruled that Wright did not author the Bitcoin whitepaper, create Bitcoin, or develop its early software, debunking his longstanding claims to the contrary. Now, Mellor has granted COPA's application for a worldwide freezing injunction to prevent Wright from dissipating assets and evading costs related to the case. The British judge found Wright's recent transfer of shares to an overseas company \"gave rise to serious concerns\" about his intentions to avoid the impending costs order. Judge Mellor quotes from the freezing order judgment: \u201cthat necessarily means (as I shall explain in my Trial judgment) that Dr Wright has forged documents on a grand scale and, during his cross-examination, he lied extensively and repeatedly.\u201d \u201cDr Wright has shown himself\u2026 pic.twitter.com/BBIlIuZNG6 \u2014 hodlonaut 80 IQ 10%er 🌮⚡🔑 🐝 (@hodlonaut) March 28, 2024 Wright must now disclose all assets exceeding $30,000 in value and is prohibited from reducing his holdings below $7.6 million. The freeze reflects ongoing doubts about Wright's trustworthiness, given his history of defaulting on court judgments and boasts about being \"judgment proof.\" The new freezing injunction further hampers Wright's ability to pursue additional Satoshi Nakamoto-related litigation. It also ensures assets will remain available to cover the multi-million dollar costs bill COPA expects to recover after debunking Wright's outlandish assertions. The British judge's actions to freeze Wright's assets appear justified in light of his dishonest behaviour. The saga underscores the need for courts to wield tools that prevent litigants like Wright from abusing the legal system and evading accountability.","article_summary":"A U.K. judge has ordered to freeze $7.6 million worth of Craig Wright's assets worldwide after finding that he falsely claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/judge-imposes-worldwide-asset-freeze-on-fake-satoshi-craig-wright","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-03-29T22:36:01Z","type":"article","category":["Bitcoin","Satoshi Nakamoto","Craig Wright","News","Legal"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/judge-imposes-worldwide-asset-freeze-on-fake-satoshi-craig-wright","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MzYwOTMzMTY0Mjk1Njc4/craif.jpg"},{"article_title":"The Infosec Basics: How to Keep Your Bitcoin Seed Phrase Secure","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","article_detailed_content":"When it comes to self custodying your bitcoin, there is one inescapable fact: the buck stops with you. You are responsible for your own funds, you are responsible for keeping them safe, you are responsible for everything. This can be a daunting prospect, but there are ways to approach self-custody simply. Securing your Bitcoin can be thought of similarly to building a house. First, you have to lay a foundation, then you build a frame on top of that, from there you fill in the walls, insulation, utilities, etc. For each piece of the house you want to add, you need to have completed the previous piece properly or the entire house will be unsafe and unstable. When it comes to Bitcoin security, your seed phrase is the foundation of your security. It is simultaneously the most important yet potentially weakest point in security. Just like the foundation of a house impacts its stability, your seed phrase impacts your wallet\u2019s security. So how do you store a seed phrase securely? Here are some core considerations to take into account when figuring out how to secure your seed phrase. Sharing Is Bad Your seed phrase is your money. Every private key needed to authorize spending, every address and every Bitcoin account in your wallet: all of these pieces are generated from your seed phrase. Anyone who has access to your seed phrase has access to any funds stored in that wallet. Thus, creating and securing a backup of this seed phrase is imperative. If something happens to your hardware wallet, or the device you installed your software wallet on, your only hope is your seed phrase backup. If you lose that seed phrase backup your money is gone. Your money is accessible in two ways when self custodying your funds, either the wallet you are using, or your seed phrase backup. Your bitcoin wallet protects a copy of your keys on that device, but it can\u2019t help you protect the seed phrase backup. No one should be given access to your seed phrase; as cold and callous as it sounds, you can\u2019t be sure they will handle it responsibly. They can still misplace a copy of your seed phrase, or leave it lying around unsecured, without any malicious intent on their part. So, rule one: never share your seed phrase with anyone. Any exception to this rule under any circumstances should be thought through long and hard before breaking it. After all, being too trusting could put your Bitcoin at risk. Computers Are Not Your Friend It is critically important to avoid recording your seed phrase in any digital format. Computers are incredibly complicated machines and thus are prone to a litany of security issues. People\u2019s devices are hacked on a regular basis. Copies of your seed phrase can be put at risk when stored digitally. In short, your laptop or smartphone is vulnerable to malware and spyware. If a hacker gains access to your device, they may be able to read your files and extract your seed phrase from any type of digital storage they can access. For this reason, you should avoid storing your seed phrase digitally. This goes especially for storing anything in a remote digital service, like a cloud storage provider. If your email account was ever compromised, the hacker could use your credentials to log in to any cloud storage service and access your seed phrase. Under no circumstances should you ever: Store your seed phrase on a cloud storage site such as iCloud or Google Drive Take pictures of it with your phone or other digital camera Send it over any digital medium, such as email or text message Enter it into anything but the bitcoin wallet you are using Handle it in front of any camera Say it out loud near a microphone The only copy of your seed phrase should be physical, and completely isolated from the internet. This is why keeping sizable amounts of Bitcoin in a software wallet on your computer or mobile phone is not recommended either. To put it simply, your internet connected devices are vulnerable to hackers. Thus, if you want to keep your Bitcoin safe, you should invest in a hardware wallet. Use Durable Seed Phrase Backups One important decision should jump out at you when it comes to making a backup of your seed phrase: what do you write it on? This may seem like a silly question if you\u2019re new to this space, but unless you stop using Bitcoin you will need to secure your seed phrase for the rest of your life. Durability is incredibly important. You could just write your seed phrase on a piece of paper and stuff it in a drawer, but how long will that stay safe? Paper is flammable: it degrades. If you spill water on it the ink could bleed and your backup could become unreadable. Paper is not suitable for longer-term storage. Metal is a much better option, and numerous products on the market are designed to store your seed phrase on metal.. Some solutions use tiny individual metal tiles with letters on them, so you can slide them into a frame and lock them in place to record your words, such as the BillFodl. Metal tile backups are reusable, so over time if you generate and move to new wallets the same backup kit can be reused for the new seed phrase. It\u2019s also possible to \u201cdestroy\u201d your backup easily if needed by removing the tiles. If you move somewhere you can\u2019t take your backups with you because of the risk of someone else finding them, for example going through an airport, you might not want to leave your backup intact. Other metal backups use etching tools to scratch or impress the words directly into a flat metal surface, providing even stronger protection against threats like fire. This is extremely secure, but destroying a copy of your seed phrase etched into metal is extremely difficult. To really be certain it is destroyed you have to grind down the entire face of the metal plate until no trace of the words are left. Lastly, there are capsule based solutions. These use little steel tiles with letters on them, but instead of sliding them into a flat frame, they are loaded into a steel tube around a rod to hold them in place. This can give the benefits of reusability while ensuring that any fire warping does not scatter and dislodge the letter tiles. When picking between metal tiles or steel plates, weigh the pros and cons of both carefully. But remember: use something metal. Don\u2019t trust your Bitcoin to a flimsy piece of paper. Physical Safety Now that we\u2019ve established how to store your seed phrase, where should you store it? Keeping the seed phrase on a robust piece of material is important, but so is keeping it in a place that is difficult to access physically. It should be stored somewhere you can keep locked, such as a safe or a lockbox. A safe is better than a lockbox, as that is bulkier and harder to physically carry. A safe attached to a wall is even better yet, requiring the destruction of a wall to remove the safe. If you don\u2019t have a safe or a lockbox, keep your seed phrase out of sight. Put it in a filing cabinet or desk drawer in a room not accessible to other people. The important part is making sure that wherever it is, no one else can access it. Splitting Your Backup You might not have a single place that can be safely secured to house your backup seed phrase. Two options exist that can allow you to maintain a safe backup without keeping your seed phrase in a single location. If you are considering splitting your seed phrase backup, follow a well known protocol or don\u2019t do it at all. Splitting your backup yourself Seed XOR is one mechanism. It is a process that allows you to take a pre-existing seed phrase and split it using a mathematical process into two (or more) new seed phrases. These new seed phrases are fully valid and can later be recombined to regenerate the original seed phrase they were created from. This allows you to divide your seed phrase into pieces and store it in multiple locations. It is very important to keep in mind though, you must have 100% of the split seed phrases, if you lose a single one you cannot regenerate the original seed phrase. A big benefit of XORing is you can do it by hand. Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing The second is Shamir Secret Sharing. Similarly to seed XORing SSS breaks your seed phrase into multiple pieces, but it uses a very different mathematical process to do so. Unlike seed XORing, Shamir shares allow you to recover your original seed phrase with less than 100% of the shares. It can be set up like a multisig, i.e. as long as you have 3-of-5 backup shares you can regenerate your seed phrase. The only downside is that only certain wallets support using Shamir, and it cannot be done by hand. Under no circumstances should you split up your seed phrase manually. If you are not following a safe and widely scrutinized protocol like Seed XOR or Shamir Secret Sharing, don\u2019t even consider it. Naively splitting your seed phrase into multiple pieces can drastically reduce the security of your bitcoin. Guessing 12 or 24 words randomly and happening to guess someone\u2019s seed phrase is statistically impossible, but if someone has 4 of those words? Or 6 of those words? It starts actually becoming practical to guess the rest of your seed phrase. Another alternative, if you use a Ledger, is the Ledger Recover service. This paid optional service uses a variant of shamir\u2019s secret sharing called Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS). This allows you to backup access your wallet without a seed phrase after going through an identity verification process with your government ID. Social Recovery If you are in a situation where you do not have a secure place to store your seed phrase backups, alternative solutions exist. Wallets and services such as Unchained, Casa, and Nunchuck Wallet offer multisig solutions where a third party can hold one of your keys for you. For instance if you have a 2-of-3 multisig, they can hold one key. This ensures that as long as you don\u2019t lose both of the keys you keep yourself, they can assist you in moving your funds to a new wallet. Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe At the end of the day securing your bitcoin is your responsibility. It is something you need to take seriously and put in the proper effort to maintain, no one is going to come and save you if you don\u2019t take it seriously. As Gandalf warned Bilbo in the Lord of the Rings, \u201cKeep it secret, keep it safe.\u201d That is your job as a Bitcoiner, to keep your seed phrase hidden from other people and safe from those who would wish to take it from you. The simple advice in this article is the vast majority of what you need to do to accomplish that. Don\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel. Just record your seed phrase on a durable medium like metal, and keep it physically safe from prying eyes and thieving hands. Keep it locked in your safe or a room other people do not frequently access. Check on it from time to time. That\u2019s all you have to do. Don\u2019t over complicate things in your head, just keep it simple and your bitcoin will be safe.","article_summary":"Security is priority #1 when it comes to keeping your bitcoin safe.

CEO Adrian Wang founded the company on a mission to build a sustainable crypto ecosystem with effective hedging solutions in an industry known for its boom and bust cycles. With the right application of derivative products, investors can \u2018earn higher and lose less\u2019 when the market is in turmoil. \u201cThe crypto industry continues to have room for growth, despite its challenges this year. We are looking very closely at how to build a stronger and healthier global market for digital assets, which we are doing together with our partners, such as Antalpha, and many others.\u201d - Adrian Wang, Founder and CEO The company changed its name from Dragon Victory International Limited (NASDAQ: LYL) and is backed up by Antalpha Technologies Limited, the world\u2019s leading blockchain financial services. In the past year, Metalpha not only built a stronger trading, research, and compliance team in-house but also sealed numerous partnerships such as Litecoin Foundation, NextGen Digital Venture, GRVT, ParaX, and many more. As a Nasdaq-listed company, Metalpha holds Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 9 (asset management) licenses through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LSQ Capital Limited, by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC). The emphasis on compliance paid off when the SFC granted an uplift on the Type 4 license. Metalpha and LSQ Capital have been actively working with the SFC on the Type 4 license uplift. With the uplifted Type 4 license, in addition to offering securities advising services, LSQ Capital is now able to issue analyses and reports on virtual assets to qualified investors. Advantages in Trading As a leader in crypto derivatives, Metalpha offers clients customized products, such as Accumulator and Snowball, that are based on mathematical models with careful financial engineering. The trading team comes with rich experience with Wall Street banks. The company reported the notional amount of derivative products issued of $382 million under its wealth management business arm, which generated a fiscal-year income of $5.7 million jumped from $0.1 million in the fiscal year 2022, a 5,600% increase. The company\u2019s trading positions have always been targeted to be market-neutral. The company has set out strict risk limits on its positions and strictly abides by the regulation requirements in the region it operates. Bullish on Bitcoin \u201cThe surging of Bitcoin\u2019s price indicates a strong demand from global investors as they are encouraged by the recent performance of Bitcoin ETF inflows. We believe the halving event later this year could further push Bitcoin price to a new height.\u201d - Adrian Wang, Founder and CEO Metalpha prides itself on being the long-term advocate of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The company has been vocal about its belief in the future mass adoption of Bitcoin since the approval of the Bitcoin ETFs. The company considers itself to be a growth-driven crypto stock and is comparable to MicroStrategy in many ways. Both Metalpha and MicroStrategy focus on Bitcoin investing, whereas Metalpha focuses particularly on the wealth management sector. Since the successful restructuring, Metalpha\u2019s stock has led a strong performance, rising more than 86% year on year as of March 3, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance. Metalpha vs. MicroStrategy \"Working with the brilliant team at NextGen has been delightful. The launch of the NextGen Fund marked the first step by both sides to roll out compliant yet rewarding products together. We look forward to building a more robust partnership going forward.\u201dAdrian Wang, Founder and CEO While Metalpha shares many similarities with MicroStrategy, key differences remain in the business model, service locations, and products. Metalpha\u2019s revenue is highly growth-focused in a bull market as Bitcoin\u2019s price increases, resulting in balance sheet expansion and trading revenue increases. In a bull market, a more active user base generally results in a higher subscription rate. Therefore the company\u2019s revenue and scale experience high growth in a bull market. While MicroStrategy is headquartered in the U.S., Metalpha is based in Hong Kong. Recent Web3 policies promoted by the Hong Kong regulators have proven effective and forward-looking. It is reasonable to anticipate the digital assets industry will also bloom in 2024 as Hong Kong fully embraces Bitcoin ETFs, STO/RWA, and other milestone innovations. On the product level, Metalpha offers bespoke hedging solutions and derivative products to qualified investors and institutions. Compared to MicroStrategy, Metalpha\u2019s business model is expansive, covering not only Bitcoin and Ethereum but also other mainstream cryptos upon request. The company offers a fully customized investing and trading experience to its customers. The company aims to offer a wide range of institutional-focused products as well. Metalpha launched Next Generation Fund I, in partnership with NextGen Digital Venture Limited. According to Bloomberg, The $100 million target fund invests directly in Grayscale's investment products and indirectly through structured derivatives in respect of Grayscale's investment products, giving institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals a compliant channel to gain indirect exposure to crypto. Despite all the differences, Metalpha considers itself Asia\u2019s MicroStrategy in the spirit of the crypto revolution and Bitcoin mass adoption. This is a guest post by Yiwei Wang.

Judge Kaplan rejected Bankman-Fried's claims that customers did not lose money and accused him of lying during the trial. During the sentencing hearing, Bankman-Fried tried to express regret for the losses suffered by FTX customers, saying he's \"sorry about what happened.\" However, Judge Kaplan emphasized the severity of the crime, stating that FTX customers lost $8 billion, equity investors lost $1.7 billion, and lenders to Bankman-Fried's hedge fund lost $1.3 billion. The judge also criticized Bankman-Fried's dishonesty during the trial, particularly regarding his knowledge of the misappropriation of customer funds. Federal prosecutors had sought a much longer sentence, highlighting the scale and impact of the financial fraud. Bankman-Fried's rapid rise in the cryptocurrency industry, came crashing down as the extensive embezzlement scheme of FTX was uncovered, in which his fraudulent actions led to significant losses for investors and customers. Many believe this 25 year sentence is injustice, as Judge Kaplan said today before the official ruling, \"I have limited my findings on obstruction to support the finding - there may be more. The total offense level is 60 - once you cross 43, it cannot go higher. The guideline is life in prison. But the maximum is 1320 months in this case.\" Renowed whistle blower and cybersecurity expert Edward Snowden commented on the news, stating \"holy shit he gave him less than Chelsea Manning (35 years) for a waaaaay worse crime.\" The FTX founder was also the Democrat party's second-biggest individual donor in the 2021/2022 election cycle (donating over $39,800,000).","article_summary":"This ruling marks the dramatic conclusion of the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX saga.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-by-judge-to-25-years-in-prison","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 17:19:26 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712917166},"creation_date":"2024-03-28T23:30:56Z","type":"article","category":["FTX","Prison","Legal","Cryptocurrency","News","Sam Bankman-Fried"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-by-judge-to-25-years-in-prison","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1NzM1ODYyNDAz/bitcoin-key.jpg"},{"article_title":"Blast-based Pac Finance unexpectedly liquidates users for $26 million","author":"Oluwapelumi Adejumo","article_detailed_content":"Blast-based lending protocol Pac Finance confirmed that its liquidation threshold was changed unexpectedly without prior information to its team, resulting in significant user losses.

Last month, Munchables, a web3 game operating on this network, suffered a loss of over $62 million due to an attack. Fortunately, the hacker returned the stolen funds voluntarily. $26 million liquidation On April 11, Will Sheehan, the founder of Parsec Finance, reported a \u201cgiant swath of ezETH Liquidations on Pac Finance.\u201d His finding was further corroborated by Kydo, an EigenLabs developer, who stated: \u201cAn EOA wallet (0xae), presumably controlled by Pac_finance, updated the liquidation threshold (allegedly) unannounced, without a timelock. $26 million got liquidated within 6 seconds after the update.\u201d Pac Finance allows users to earn interest by depositing their crypto holdings. To safeguard against default, borrowers are restricted to loans based on a set percentage of their collateral, known as the \u201cloan-to-value ratio\u201d (LTV). Adjustments to the LTV are infrequent and typically announced by the development team before implementation. However, on-chain data shows that a developer wallet changed the LTV for Renzo and restaked ETH (ezETH) to 60%. That change meant several borrowers did not meet the collateral rules, hence the liquidation. Notably, most of the liquidation comes from one user who lost $23.9 million. Pac Finance response Pac Finance stated that it is in contact with affected users to develop a mitigation plan. The team also said it is working to prevent a repeat of the incident by setting up a framework where users are notified of every decision before it happens. The platform added: \u201cIn our effort to adjust the LTV, we tasked a smart contract engineer to make the necessary changes. However, it was discovered that the liquidation threshold was altered unexpectedly without prior notification to our team, leading to the current issue.\u201d Aave founder Stani Kulechov commented on the situation, attributing the issue to a lack of knowledge of the codebase. Kulechov referred to Pac Finance as a fork of Aave, suggesting that the project uses Aave code as the basis of its platform. \u201cRandom Aave fork on Blast decreased Liquidation Threshold (LT) instead of Loan to Value (LTV) causing $26M worth of unnecessary liquidations.

The growth has firmly positioned the app among the top self-custodial wallets globally, showcasing its capacity with an average of 7.1 transactions per second. Tiago Sada, Head of Product at TFH, shared excitement about the milestone, focusing on its tangible impact. He said: \u201cReaching this milestone demonstrates the potential of making the fundamental technologies of Ethereum accessible and user-friendly. The World App represents our dedication to simplicity and functionality in the crypto domain.\u201d The World App aims to simplify crypto interactions by focusing on the essential functions of Worldcoin and Ethereum. It enables users to authenticate their identity with World ID, execute global transactions without fees, engage in crypto token swaps, and access Worldcoin Grants in many areas. The app accommodates a broad user base, supports most mobile devices, provides gasless transactions, and offers 24/7 support in over 10 languages. Remco Bloemen, head of blockchain at the Worldcoin Foundation, praised World App\u2019s success as an entry point for further adoption and innovation within the Worldcoin ecosystem. He added that he looks forward to the development of more wallets to suit varying user preferences, reflecting the Worldcoin community\u2019s goal for greater decentralization and accessibility. A notable instance of the app\u2019s impact comes from Kenya, where a World App user purchased a goat using Worldcoin. The story garnered attention and support from the crypto community, leading to donations that allowed the user to acquire additional livestock. Sada said: \u201cSuch stories vividly illustrate the life-changing potential of cryptocurrency. Our vision is to enable similar empowering experiences on a global scale.\u201d With the World App now serving over 10 million users, TFH continues to illustrate the broad possibilities of crypto in enhancing global economic engagement. The development comes amid a backdrop of regulatory concerns regarding Worldcoin\u2019s biometric data collection practices in several countries, including Kenya. Worldcoin recently made a lot of its code open-source in an effort to be more transparent about its data collection. The project has also undergone a security audit and received praised from industry magnates.

However, these narratives are constantly changing, and the trends within them continuously evolve. Keeping up with the latest trends requires in-depth knowledge of what these narratives are and how they rapidly evolve in the crypto market. This analysis is based on data from Dune Analytics, specifically from @cryptokoryo, who was among the first to group these narratives into quantifiable indices. Each index places equal weighting on the top five projects within that particular narrative, creating an imperfect but extremely useful dataset for analyzing the DeFi space. The original data identified around 30 narratives, but a few have stood out as dominant since the beginning of the year. AI, encompassing AGIX, ALI, FET, OCEAN, ORAI, Friend.tech with Cobie, 0xRacerAlt, HsakaTrades, Banks, and Zhusu tokens; Memecoins with BONE, DOGE, ELON, FLOKI, SHIB, BOB, LADYS, PEPE, TURBO, and WOJAK tokens. The Bitcoin ETF narrative has also been prominent this year, with the index following the performance of BTC and BCH. When it comes to trading volume, the Bitcoin ETF narrative is unrivaled. Data from Dune showed that BTC and BCH trading volume accounted for 46.1% of the total trading volume across narratives on April 8. Graph showing the share of total trading volume across various crypto narratives from Mar. 20, 2023, to Apr. 11, 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) However, it might be wise to exclude BTC-related activity from the rest of the DeFi narrative as a completely different set of factors drives it. Focusing solely on DeFi, we see that DeFi Bluechips (AAVE, COMP, CRV, MKR, and UNI) accounted for the majority of the trading volume. Graph showing the share of total trading volume across various crypto narratives excluding Bitcoin ETFs from Mar. 20, 2023, to Apr. 11, 2024 Regarding the total number of transactions, one narrative has been dominating for the better part of the last two months\u2014memes. More specifically, the original memecoin index that tracks the performance of BONE, DOGE, ELON, FLOKI, and SHIB. It peaked on April 3, accounting for 36.4% of the transactions from these narratives, and has consistently accounted for around a quarter of the transactions since. Graph showing the share of the total number of transactions across various crypto narratives from Mar. 20, 2023, to Apr. 11, 2024 (Dune Analytics) Looking at the year-to-date (YTD) performance of these narratives further confirms memes\u2019 supremacy. Memes have shown a 368% YTD return as of April 11, drastically outperforming the second-ranked narrative \u2014 layer-2 liquid staking tokens ASX, LBR, PENDLE, and TENET (252%). Real-world assets (RWA), tokenized tangible assets that exist in the real world, ranked third with a YTD performance of 234%. The worst-performing narratives this year have been NFTs, with a YTD loss of 33%, while Gamble-Fi, with BCB, BETU, FUN, RLB, and WINR, trailed closely behind with a 22% YTD loss. Chart showing the year-to-date (YTD) percent return for crypto narratives as of Apr. 11, 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) While memes seem to be a long-term trend this year, a newcomer has the potential to shake up the DeFi narrative in the coming weeks: wallets. The index tracking the performance of Trust Wallet Token (TWT), SafePal (SFP), Coin98 (C98), THORWallet (TGT), and XDEFI Wallet (XDEFI) showed an average weekly return of 1,012% on April 8, propelling it to the top of the crypto narratives. Graph showing the average percent return per week for crypto narratives from Mar. 20, 2023, to Apr. 11, 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) Delving deeper into the narrative reveals that THORWallet\u2019s native token, TGT, exhibited a 5,018% weekly return on April 8, while SafePal\u2019s native token increased by just over 20%. Table showing the average percent return and price performance breakdown for the top 11 crypto narratives on Apr. 11, 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) Although this certainly represents an anomaly, there\u2019s a possibility that wallets and their native tokens will continue to sustain their popularity, albeit not at these levels. The second-highest ranking narrative in terms of weekly returns was ENS Registrations, which posted a 51.8% return during the same timeframe. Friend.tech closely followed with a 50.55% weekly return, showing a much more sustainable trajectory in recent weeks. The DeFi space is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of the crypto market, with narratives shaping and reshaping the direction of interests and money flow. While \u201ctraditional\u201d assets like those included in the Bitcoin ETF narrative continue to command the majority of attention and trading volume, newer narratives, particularly those focusing on DeFi-native use cases and applications, are not far behind. The extraordinary performance of memes this year shows the market\u2019s unsatiable appetite for speculation. This appetite is further fueled by social media and its influence on the retail segment of the market. However, the rise in wallet tokens seems to signal a growing interest in infrastructure and tools that, at least on paper, enhance security and user experience. This, alongside the fluctuating fortunes of NFTs and Gamble-Fi narratives, seems to show a young but promising move towards value and sustainable models within the DeFi space. In the coming months, the ability to anticipate and adapt to these narrative shifts will be crucial for anyone participating in the DeFi market. The insights gleaned from analyzing these trends not only offer a glimpse into the current state of the market but also hint at the future direction of DeFi innovation and investment.

Through a letter addressed to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, FinCEN highlighted the digital currency exchange\u2019s role in aiding law enforcement efforts via its compliance and reporting practices. The recognition comes amid the backdrop of an SEC lawsuit against the exchange over alleged securities violations. The acknowledgment forms part of the annual FinCEN Director\u2019s Law Enforcement Awards Program, which celebrates substantial criminal cases that have utilized Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting as a foundation for successful investigations and prosecutions. This year, Coinbase\u2019s involvement stood out in one of the seven notable cases recognized by the program, marking a significant acknowledgment for the crypto sector in the fight against financial crimes. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal shared the news and expressed appreciation for the recognition over social media, emphasizing the company\u2019s commitment to removing bad actors from the financial ecosystem. Grewal praised the company\u2019s compliance and government investigations teams for their excellence in maintaining a lawful environment despite facing criticism. The FinCEN letter stressed the critical role of BSA reporting in meeting regulatory requirements and supporting the integrity of the US financial system. It detailed how law enforcement, counter-terrorism agencies, and financial regulators rely on the financial intelligence generated from these reports to combat crimes ranging from elder fraud to terrorism. Additionally, the letter illuminated the impact of BSA reports beyond assisting investigations. These reports fuel FinCEN\u2019s analytical work, enabling the identification of new illicit finance trends and the development of preventive measures. The bureau also uses these reports to inform the regulated community through information-sharing initiatives and publications.

What The Fundamentals Say","author":"Jake Simmons","article_detailed_content":"Solana (SOL) has recently become a focal point of discussion among investors and analysts. After surging from below $22 to a high of $210 within six months, and currently trading at around $174\u2014a nearly 700% increase\u2014questions arise about the sustainability of its price rally. Despite the impressive surge, SOL remains 50% shy of its November 2021 all-time high of $260. The recent consolidation pattern over the past four weeks suggests a cooling off period. As the market looks forward, understanding the underlying fundamentals becomes crucial. Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst (CMT) at Real Vision, notes in an analysis, \u201cWhile Solana\u2019s outperformance has waned in the past month, it is still the best-performing network in the past 12\u201318 months by a country mile. [\u2026] Solana\u2019s price adjustment seems abrupt but is aligned with fundamental indicators that suggest a stabilizing rather than diminishing value proposition,\u201d Coutts explains. Solana Fundamentals Remain Strong Solana\u2019s Daily Active Users (DAUs) have risen dramatically, up more than 400% over the last nine months. This growth places Solana in a rarefied group of networks boasting over 1 million DAUs. Despite not reaching its 2021 peak DAUs, which may have been inflated by synthetic activities linked to the FTX exchange, the nature of engagement on Solana has evolved. \u201cThe ecosystem is maturing; the engagement we see today is fundamentally different\u2014more diverse and significantly more integrated with real-world applications,\u201d Coutts remarked. He highlighted the burgeoning sectors contributing to this growth, including artificial intelligence, decentralized finance, consumer applications, and the burgeoning memecoin and NFT spaces. With a significant retracement from its 2021 peak price, Solana\u2019s market capitalization has still managed to hit new highs this cycle, suggesting a broadening base of investment and valuation recalibration. \u201cThe Network Value to User (NVU) ratio indicates that while the asset appreciation is notable, it\u2019s the user growth that provides a compelling story for Solana,\u201d Coutts notes. At present, Solana\u2019s NVU ratio fluctuates between 50-100, reflective of a balanced growth-to-value dynamic when compared with other networks where speculative value often outstrips user growth. One of the standout metrics for Solana this cycle has been its fee revenue, which has seen a sixfold increase in a nine-month period. Daily fees now average $1.8 million, a fortyfold increase. This surge is largely attributable to the network\u2019s increasing utilization across various applications. \u201cFee income not reaching its peak is a misnomer; what\u2019s crucial is that the financial underpinnings of the network\u2014highlighted by fee income\u2014are stronger than ever,\u201d Coutts emphasized. He also compared Solana\u2019s fee income, which reached about 20% of Ethereum\u2019s in March, demonstrating its growing financial stature within the ecosystem. Solana Vs. Ethereum And Future Outlook While Solana still lags behind Ethereum in terms of total dApps, its economic indicators are robust. With 134 dApps, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 2,702, Solana\u2019s dApp cash flow intensity is second only to Ethereum, indicating a high monetization capability per application. \u201cSolana\u2019s smaller, more potent suite of applications is driving economic efficiency that rivals even the largest networks,\u201d states Coutts. Despite the speculative components associated with memecoins and airdrops driving part of the transaction volume, Solana\u2019s adjusted fee growth metric isolates and highlights genuine economic activity. With a staggering real fee growth rate of 3,259.7%, Solana leads all networks in this metric. \u201cWhile some underlying activities might be transitory, the intense and growing usage of Solana\u2019s blockchain is undeniable evidence of its utility and viability,\u201d Coutts concludes. As Solana continues to develop and expand its ecosystem, the fundamental analysis underscores a network that not only maintains robust health and economic vigor but is also poised for future growth. This paints a picture of a blockchain platform that, despite market volatilities, remains a leading player in the crypto landscape, backed by strong fundamentals and promising growth metrics.

Trading Volume Plunges Over 70%","author":"Christian Encila","article_detailed_content":"Bucking the trend within the highly volatile memecoin sector, Bonk (BONK), a Solana-native meme token, has exhibited a bearish bias despite prevailing bullish sentiment across the broader memecoin market. Recent data from CoinMarketCap reveals a staggering 25% price decline for Bonk over the past month, a stark contrast to the general upward trajectory witnessed across the meme coin landscape during the same period. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00002166, down 1.93% and 1.40% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from CMC shows. Traders Grapple With Uncertainty In Bonk\u2019s Derivatives Market In the derivatives market, where traders speculate on the future price movements of assets, Bonk\u2019s futures open interest has witnessed a dramatic decline, plummeting by a staggering 60% since early March, as reported by data from Coinglass. This sharp downturn in open interest reflects a significant reduction in the number of contracts or positions held by traders, indicative of diminishing interest and confidence in Bonk\u2019s prospects among derivative traders. Despite the pronounced downturn in futures open interest, the funding rate across various cryptocurrency exchanges has managed to maintain a positive stance. This funding rate, which reflects the cost of holding long positions relative to short positions, suggests that some traders are still maintaining optimism and are unwilling to entirely abandon the possibility of an impending uptrend in Bonk\u2019s price. However, the conflicting signals between technical indicators and market sentiment leave traders grappling with uncertainty, unsure whether to hold onto their positions or cut their losses. The 30-day period under review has seen a significant fall in Bonk\u2019s daily trading volume, with Santiment\u2019s data indicating a 75% decrease. This decline in trading activity adds further weight to the bearish sentiment surrounding the coin, signaling waning investor interest and confidence in its potential. Technical Indicators Signal Trouble For Bonk Further exacerbating Bonk\u2019s woes are its momentum indicators, which reveal a troubling discrepancy between distribution and accumulation. The Money Flow Index (MFI) points to increased selling activity, outweighing any attempts at buying and adding further downward pressure on the coin\u2019s value. As the market grapples with these conflicting signals, the spotlight remains firmly fixed on Bonk and its ability to weather the storm. With its MACD line sinking below the signal and zero lines, signaling a weakening short-term trend compared to its longer-term outlook, traders are faced with a critical decision point. A Glimmer Of Hope Amidst The Storm As traders continue to monitor the situation closely, there is potential for a shift in sentiment that could breathe new life into Bonk\u2019s ailing price. For now, the road ahead for Bonk remains uncertain, with technical indicators pointing towards further declines while traders cling to hopes of a reversal.

The judgment was handed down by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan during a hearing in a Lower Manhattan federal courtroom on March 28. Bankman-Fried, who had publicly announced plans to appeal the conviction, has now officially filed an objection to the decision. \u2018Remorse And Empathy\u2019 For FTX Customers During the sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan leveled serious accusations against Bankman-Fried, including perjury and evasiveness during his testimony. The judge expressed disappointment in Bankman-Fried\u2019s lack of regret for the crimes committed. In response, Bankman-Fried expressed remorse and empathy for the \u201cthousands of customers\u201d who suffered financial losses. He acknowledged his responsibility as CEO of FTX and expressed desire to repair the damage caused. Bankman-Fried expressed frustration at the loss of what he had achieved and his limited ability to improve the situation from prison. Despite his efforts, he acknowledged the constraints that limited his ability to do more. Sam Bankman-Fried Alleges Trial Unfairness In a post-conviction interview, Bankman-Fried expressed concerns about the fairness of his trial, specifically targeting Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX\u2019s new owners. The disgraced FTX co-founder accused the law firm of colluding with the prosecution and obstructing his access to key FTX documents shared with the prosecution. Bankman-Fried claimed that this had a detrimental effect on the entire trial, including media coverage and the defense\u2019s ability to present evidence in his favor. With the official appeal now filed, Bankman-Fried is seeking a different outcome, hoping for a reduced sentence. He emphasized the importance of introducing crucial evidence and presenting key witnesses, which he claims his defense was denied the opportunity to do during the trial. Currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Bankman-Fried has been particularly vocal about his desire to remain in the MDC-Brooklyn jail pending the outcome of his appeal. As this high-profile case unfolds, the crypto mogul\u2019s quest for a different outcome and the damage caused by FTX\u2019s collapse continue to captivate public attention. Future actions by the US government in response to this appeal, as well as subsequent legal actions and filings by Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team, are yet to be determined. Presently, the native token of the exchange, FTT, is trading at $1.60. Notably, the token has experienced a noteworthy 4% price increase within the last 24 hours, distinguishing it from the overall trend of sideways price movement or declines observed across the cryptocurrency market. However, it is important to note that the token has witnessed a decline of 32% over the past month, which has considerably diminished FTT\u2019s year-to-date surge, currently standing at 25%.

One of the most notable developments, however, was the entry of Toncoin (TON) into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and then dethroning Cardano (ADA). Following this, Dogecoin looks ready to carry out a flippening of its own, eyeing XRP\u2019s spot on the list. Dogecoin Gearing Up To Take Over XRP Dogecoin has performed rather well at a time when the crypto market has remained indecisive. Even though there has been times when the price has dipped, it has managed to reclaim $0.2, although the majority of bearish resistance is being mounted at this junction. Nevertheless, Dogecoin\u2019s ability to hold most of its gains from March has seen its market cap increase rapidly. From less than $15 billion at the start of the year 2024, the meme coin\u2019s market cap has now climbed above $28.6 billion, putting it dangerously close to the market cap of XRP. At the time of writing, XRP\u2019s market cap is sitting at $33.9 billion, spurred by the decline in its price over the last week. This means that the market cap of XRP is now only 15.6% higher than that of Dogecoin, a perilously small gap given how quickly prices of cryptocurrencies can rise. In this case, if Dogecoin continues to perform well and XRP fails to keep up, it could easily lose the sixth spot on the list to DOGE. A 20% rise in the DOGE price to $0.24 would put its market cap above $34 billion, putting it ahead of XRP. And if XRP\u2019s continues to fall, then the gap could tighten over the next week. DOGE Price Projected To Explode Dogecoin currently boasts one of the strongest crypto communities, and some would argue even stronger than the XRP army, as DOGE\u2019s support base has strengthened due to its outperformance in the past. This support base and rapid adoption are two of the foremost factors that promise an interesting future for the meme coin. There have been many predictions for where the future price of DOGE might be, with some going as high as $100. However, according to crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin could do quite well in this bull market. The analysis posted by Martinez reveals multiple price targets, with $12 at the top.

Over the past few weeks, MakerDAO has implemented significant updates to the protocol and the DAI stablecoin. Introducing the Accelerated Proposal and the direct deposit module (D3M) to Spark\u2019s Metamorpho Vault has notably impacted the ecosystem. Increased DAI Supply And Demand Looking at key metrics that demonstrate the effects of these changes to the protocol, the DAI supply in circulation currently stands at nearly 5 billion, reflecting a growth of approximately 300 million over the past month. This growth indicates continued demand for the stablecoin. On the other hand, the Dai Savings Rate has significantly increased since implementing the Accelerated Proposal. Approximately 1.54 billion DAI are currently deposited in the Dai Savings Rate, of which approximately 976 million DAI are sDAI, representing an increase of roughly 400 million DAI in deposits. The Maker Protocol\u2019s total value locked (TVL) amounts to approximately $8.4 billion across various vault types. This TVL growth can be attributed to strategic deployments in D3M modules, significant contributions from Ethereum-based collaterals, and the integration of real-world assets. These developments have enhanced the protocol\u2019s diversification and resilience. MakerDAO Ethereum Vaults Thrive A notable addition to the MakerDAO ecosystem is the Morpho DM3, which enables the Morpho Vault to mint DAI. Currently, the lending pool has deployed 200 million DAI. According to the protocol\u2019s post, this allocation is projected to generate approximately 50 million in annual income for the Maker Protocol, making it the second-largest core vault in terms of annualized fees. It will play a significant role in generating revenue and contributing to the Maker Protocol\u2019s sustainability. Among the Ethereum vault types within the MakerDAO ecosystem, the ETH-C vault stands out with the largest value locked in crypto collateral at approximately $1.88 billion. This vault generates approximately $43 million in annual fees, underscoring its importance within the Maker ecosystem and contribution to the protocol\u2019s revenue streams. Another important component is the Spark D3M, which is supplied with around 970 million DAI. This module is projected to generate an annual income of approximately 28 million. These recent changes have positively impacted the Maker Protocol. The increase in DAI supply, growth in the Dai Savings Rate, expansion of collaterals, and introduction of different vault types have contributed to the protocol\u2019s growth and development. Despite the growth in the MakerDAO ecosystem, the native token MKR has experienced a continuous 5.9% price decline over the past fourteen days. In the last seven days alone, the token has recorded a significant 17% price drop, resulting in its current trading price of $3,355. However, despite the price decline, Token Terminal data reveals positive trends. The protocol\u2019s market capitalization currently stands at $3.3 billion, reflecting a notable 28% increase over the past 30 days. Additionally, trading volume for the MKR token has experienced a substantial surge, reaching $5.9 billion, representing a 119% increase over the same time frame.

The poll, which asked the crypto community to assess the security threshold of ETH staked in securing the blockchain, indicated a lack of awareness about the actual risks of an attack. Respondents to the poll displayed the following beliefs about Ethereum\u2019s security: 44.9% believed that securing Ethereum requires 100% of all ETH staked, amounting to $110 billion, 31.4 million ETH. 20.4% thought 66.6% of staked ETH was sufficient, equivalent to $73.4 billion, 20.9 million ETH. 34.7% felt that only 33.3% of staked ETH, or $36.7 billion, 10.4 million ETH, was required for security. How Vulnerable Is Ethereum? Addressing these misconceptions, Christine Kim emphasized the actual vulnerabilities of Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in a detailed follow-up on X. Kim highlighted, \u201cYou don\u2019t need 100% of ETH staked to attack Ethereum. 33% is enough to disrupt finality, 50% to prolong a chain split, and 66% to double spend.\u201d She added, \u201cSecurity primarily depends on the network\u2019s ability to penalize stakers by burning large amounts of the value they\u2019ve locked. The worse the attack, the more value stakers stand to lose. It\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s really at stake here (pun fully intended).\u201d Further elaboration from the Ethereum Foundation explains the technical underpinnings of these vulnerabilities. An article by the foundation, referenced by Kim, states, \u201cAttackers using >= 33% of the total stake make all of the attacks mentioned previously more likely to succeed\u2026 33% of the staked ether is a benchmark for an attacker because with anything greater than this amount they have the ability to prevent the chain from finalizing without having to finely control the actions of the other validators.\u201d For attacks involving 34% of the total stake, the article detailed a possible scenario of \u201cdouble finality\u201d where an attacker can manipulate the validation of two conflicting blockchain forks simultaneously. This form of attack is characterized by significant coordination and control over the timing of messages within the network, posing a high risk due to potential slashing of the attacker\u2019s entire staked amount. Higher levels of controlled staking, such as 50% and 66%, increase the potential for more severe disruptions, including sustained chain splits and transaction censorship or reversal. The foundation\u2019s article elaborates, \u201cAt >50% of the total stake the attacker could dominate the fork choice algorithm\u2026 enabling the attacker to censor certain transactions, do short-range reorgs and extract maximum MEV by reordering blocks in their favor.\u201d The defense against these threats includes the \u201cinactivity leak,\u201d a mechanism that gradually reduces the staked ether of non-participating or malicious validators, and the social layer of consensus among the Ethereum community on which chain to continue should a split occur. These revelations underscore the importance of community awareness and technical safeguards in maintaining the security and integrity of the Ethereum network. They highlight that while Ethereum\u2019s PoS system offers several security advantages, it also requires vigilant monitoring and readiness to act against potential attacks. 3 Trends In ETH Staking As the Ethereum staking landscape evolves, several key trends have emerged this, reshaping how stakeholders interact with and benefit from the staking process. Tom Wan, researcher at 21.co, highlighted these in a recent post on X: Increase in Re-staking Popularity: Since 2024, there has been a significant shift towards re-staking in the Ethereum ecosystem. Re-staking contributions have grown from 10% to 60% of the total staked ETH. Eigenlayer, in particular, has risen to prominence as the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, holding a $15 billion Total Value Locked (TVL), which represents 13% of all staked ETH. Decline in Lido\u2019s Market Share: The rise of liquid restaking protocols has noticeably impacted Lido\u2019s dominance in the Ethereum staking market. Lido\u2019s share has fallen below 30%, influenced by the growth of new platforms like Etherfi, which has become the second-largest withdrawer of stETH since 2024, totaling withdrawals of 108k stETH. Centralized Exchange (CEX) Staking Decline: The dominance of centralized exchanges in ETH staking has seen a downturn, decreasing from 29.7% to 25.8% since 2024. Kiln Finance recently surpassed Binance to become the third-largest ETH staking entity. Ether.fi is also gaining ground and is positioned to further challenge Binance\u2019s former dominance in the near future. At press time, ETH traded at $3,526.","article_summary":"A recent poll conducted by Christine Kim, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, has revealed significant misconceptions within the Ethereum community regarding the blockchain\u2019s economic security.

The culmination of this lengthy dispute marks a significant victory for Hodlonaut and casts further doubt on Wright\u2019s assertions regarding his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto. The origins of this legal feud trace back to May 2019 when Wright filed a lawsuit against Hodlonaut over critical social media posts. Hodlonaut, a Norwegian Bitcoiner, had publicly accused Wright of being a \u201cscammer\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d for his claims of creating Bitcoin. This sparked a contentious legal battle that spanned multiple years and jurisdictions. Courtroom Showdown: Hodlonaut Emerges Victorious In Defamation Dispute After a trial in Oslo in 2022, a Norwegian judge ruled in favor of Hodlonaut, concluding that there were substantial grounds to believe Wright had deceived in his attempts to prove his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.

Despite Wright\u2019s appeal of the court\u2019s ruling, nearly five years later, he has finally relented, dropping his pursuit of legal action against Hodlonaut. This development underscores the resilience of Hodlonaut and the skepticism surrounding Wright\u2019s claims within the Bitcoin community. COPA Triumph: Wright\u2019s Whitepaper Ownership Claim Rejected In a parallel legal battle, Craig Wright faced another setback as the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) challenged his claim of ownership over the Bitcoin whitepaper. After rigorous scrutiny, a court ruled against Wright, decisively rejecting his assertion that he authored the foundational document of Bitcoin. This ruling dealt a significant blow to Wright\u2019s credibility and further undermined his position as Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright\u2019s Bitcoin Saga: Norwegian Lawsuit Ends, But Scrutiny Remains The resolution of these legal disputes comes amid ongoing speculation and skepticism surrounding Wright\u2019s claims within the cryptocurrency community. While the conclusion of the lawsuit in Norway represents a victory for Hodlonaut, there remains a pending defamation case against him in the UK. Despite this looming legal challenge, the outcome of the Norwegian case underscores the difficulty Wright faces in substantiating his claims and the growing scrutiny surrounding his alleged role in the creation of Bitcoin.

The unexpected developments echo throughout the bitcoin space, igniting a fresh discussion about governmental overreach and its possible to inhibit innovation. The tempest began when Uniswap CEO, Hayden Adams, disclosed that the SEC had issued a Wells Notice to the exchange, signaling the agency\u2019s intent to pursue enforcement actions. This revelation sent ripples through the crypto markets, with Uniswap\u2019s native token, UNI, witnessing a precipitous 10% decline in value within a mere 24-hour period. Uniswap Under Fire: Regulatory Storm Clouds Gather The SEC\u2019s move against Uniswap echoes its ongoing legal battle with Ripple, drawing parallels that raise questions about the regulator\u2019s modus operandi. Pro-crypto attorney Bill Morgan points out a striking similarity in the SEC\u2019s approach, noting the agency\u2019s penchant for biding its time before swooping in on successful crypto enterprises.

Voices from within the community express concern over the potential chilling effect of the SEC\u2019s actions on innovation and decentralization, highlighting the need for greater regulatory clarity and dialogue. Defiance In The Face Of Adversity Matt Corva, General Counsel at ConsenSys, offers a sobering perspective on the SEC\u2019s enforcement agenda, suggesting ulterior motives aimed at quelling the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and preserving the status quo. Adam Cochran, founder of venture capital firms Cinneamhain Ventures, also reflects on the situation, pondering why the agency decided to send the company a Wells Notice at this point. As Uniswap prepares to mount its defense against the SEC\u2019s onslaught, industry stakeholders brace for a protracted legal battle that could shape the future of decentralized finance. The outcome of this confrontation will not only impact Uniswap and its users but could also set a precedent for how regulators engage with emerging technologies in the digital age.

Solana-based lending and borrowing protocol MarginFi has recently been \u201cbeefing\u201d with Solend, another lending protocol, and SolBlaze, a liquid staking platform. Amid the drama, MarginFi\u2019s CEO and founder stepped down after some \u201cinappropriate\u201d X posts and massive criticism. The project now faces significant outflows and a lack of trust from the Solana community. Solana\u2019s Projects Fight Each Other Yesterday, SolBlaze claimed that MarginFi had failed to replenish the BLZE tokens into their rewards system for users to claim for the past three weeks. Moreover, the staking platform implied that the MarginFi team refused to respond to their attempts to reach out and clarify the situation. MacBrennan, the co-founder of the MRGN group, considered the project \u201cthe target of a very unfortunate hit piece.\u201d In an X post, the MarginFi contributor \u201cclarified the misinformation.\u201d We were the target of a very unfortunate hit piece today.

The problems were caused by the Solana network congestion and \u201cprioritizing user safety.\u201d Additionally, MacBrennan refuted the claims that MarginFi\u2019s team declined to respond. According to the post, the SolBlaze team reached out to them at 4:46 am on the same day SolBlaze posted the \u201cexposé.\u201d MarginFi users were quick to respond to MacBrennan\u2019s post, criticizing the project for not being truthful. The protocol users legitimized SolBlaze\u2019s claims by stating they had not received BLZE tokens long before the network congestion started. Adding fuel to the fire, the Solend protocol team posted on their official X account that the project will airdrop to the users who withdraw from MarginFi and deposit into their protocol. Rooter, Solend\u2019s founder, explained why they joined in, affirming that his project was \u201con the receiving end of multiple attacks\u201d during the bear market. The alleged attacks from the MarginFi team included \u201cattempting to blackball Solend with peers,\u201d bad-mouthing and criticizing the project, and \u201cattacking Solend\u2019s oracle configuration.\u201d Rooter claimed that healthy competition is well-received, but that isn\u2019t what occurs with MarginFi. Solend\u2019s founder concluded: \u201cMarginFi rubs many teams the wrong way with their misconduct.\u201d MarginFi CEO Quits, Claims Differences With The Team Amid the drama, MarginFi\u2019s founder and CEO, Edgar Pavlovsky, made a series of responses to the criticism that were not well received.

Amid these regulatory challenges, Uniswap Labs has partnered with Across, a cross-chain protocol, to propose a new standard for cross-chain intents. Uniswap Labs And Across Collaboration The joint proposal announced Thursday introduces a new standard for cross-chain intents that enables end-to-end interoperability between intent-based systems through a universal filler network. Cross-chain intents involve transferring or interacting with assets and protocols across multiple blockchain platforms. To initiate the process of creating an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) around this standard, Uniswap Labs and Across plan to present the standard to the CAKE Working Group for further discussion and review. Furthermore, UniswapX, the upcoming project by Uniswap Labs focusing on cross-chain functionality, will be the first adopter of the new ERC. By integrating support for cross-chain functionality, UniswapX aims to improve the user experience and expand the scope of its services. Intent-Based Systems The Uniswap Labs team stated that cross-chain protocols have traditionally adopted various approaches to connect activities between blockchain networks. While messaging-based designs have been popular, they \u201csuffer from slow transfer finalization and high costs.\u201d Intents-based approaches offer a \u201cmore efficient\u201d solution for the software development company. Uniswap Labs further asserts that by allowing users to specify the desired end-state of the chain, intents-based systems enable a network of fillers to compete and fulfill the user\u2019s outcome quickly and cost-effectively. However, until now, each intent-based system has operated through its network, resulting in delays and alleged \u201ccentralization risks,\u201d according to the company. The announcement also notes that the proposed standard establishes rules at Ethereum\u2019s application layer, allowing independent intent-based systems to \u201cinteroperate easily.\u201d Lower Costs And Faster Order Delivery? The \u2018CrossChainOrder\u2019 and \u2018CrossChainSettler\u2019 components are central to the proposed standard. The \u2018CrossChainOrder\u2019 struct defines key parameters of the user\u2019s order, including the deadline for order fulfillment or delivery, the settlement contract that holds user funds, and implementation-specific data. The \u2018CrossChainSettler\u2019 interface specifies the functions settlement contracts must implement to resolve and initiate implementation-specific orders on-chain. By adhering to this ERC standard, users can reportedly sign cross-chain orders that conform to a unified specification. Whether interacting with UniswapX, Across, or other systems, the company claims that users follow the same standard, enabling cross-chain applications to share filler sets through a universal network. This approach is said to eliminate siloed networks and reduce reliance on a few fillers, thereby improving decentralization and reducing the risks associated with centralized fillers. Ultimately, the company believes establishing a unified standard for intent-based systems will significantly improve the user experience for applications, fillers, and end users. The Uniswap Labs team concluded by stating: Fillers have a lower entry barrier, and lower costs, and they can capture more order flow instead of specializing for a single application. Applications can route their users\u2019 intents through a wider, more competitive network. And users get faster fills and lower costs because the fillers operate with greater capital efficiency. The receipt of the SEC\u2019s Wells Notice by Uniswap Labs has significantly impacted the UNI token, leading to a notable downtrend in its price. Over the past 24 hours alone, the token has experienced a price drop of more than 21%. This downward trend has extended to nearly 35% over the past month, resulting in the current trading price of $8.820.

Bitcoin 7-Day Mining Hashrate Is Back Near ATH Levels The \u201cmining hashrate\u201d refers to the total computing power that the miners have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric correlates with the network\u2019s security. To perform a successful 51% attack on the network, bad actors must gain control over at least 51% of the online mining rigs. When the hashrate goes up, the security naturally strengthens, as there are now more machines that an attacker needs to succeed. Of course, this is only true if the new power being added to the network is properly decentralized. If the hashrate is centralized, the network risk may not decrease by the same degree if more power is added. The hashrate also provides a look into the demand for mining cryptocurrency. Growth suggests that miners find the network attractive, while a decline implies that some miners find the chain unprofitable and have thus decided to disconnect. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate has registered an increase recently and has approached its ATH value setback in mid-March. The miners have decided to re-expand their facilities after dialing back earlier. Besides measuring the total computing power, the hashrate can also be viewed as a representation of the competition between the individual miners. On the Bitcoin network, block rewards that the miners receive are fixed in BTC value (except for during Halving events, when they are permanently slashed in half). The chain also aims to distribute them at a more or less steady rate, with a block added about every 10 minutes. This means that even if the miners add more hashrate, they can\u2019t use the extra power to process blocks faster. Thus, since the rewards stay the same, an increase in the hashrate means the share of every individual miner gets smaller. A miner can only prevent this from happening if they also increase their hashrate by the same proportion as the network increase. Either way, an increase in the hashrate is bad news for the margins of the individual miners, as it means that competition has just become tougher. To ensure this dynamic remains true, the Bitcoin network has the \u201cdifficulty\u201d feature implemented. When the miners add more computing power, the block time initially shrinks as they leverage the extra hashrate to pump out blocks faster. As a response, however, the network increases the difficulty, making it harder for the miners to solve blocks. Thus, any speed increase counteracts the extra computing power offered. Following the latest hashrate increase, it\u2019s not unexpected that the difficulty has also increased in the latest biweekly adjustment on the chain. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,700, up 3% over the past week.","article_summary":"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining difficulty has risen by 4% recently as the mining hashrate has approached all-time high (ATH) levels.

The internal agency document obtained by Fortune indicates that the investigation was abruptly closed, leaving many questions unanswered. Dapper Labs Investigation Terminated By SEC Chief Per the report, the SEC\u2019s crypto and cyber unit chief, David Hirsch, terminated the \u201cDapper Labs, Inc.\u201d investigation on September 29. However, the report does not disclose the reasons for the investigation, the duration, or the factors leading to its closure. Notably, the SEC did not provide the five-page recommendations associated with the report, and a spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation\u2019s existence. The SEC\u2019s decision to close the Dapper Labs investigation follows settlements with Impact Theory and Stoner Cats, marking the SEC\u2019s initial actions against the NFT industry. The agency argued that both projects offered and sold \u201cunregistered securities\u201d in alleged violation of federal law. Notably, Dapper Labs also faces an ongoing class action lawsuit in which plaintiffs allege that NBA Top Shot Moments, NFTs sold by Dapper Labs, are unregistered securities. Caution Still Necessary? The SEC\u2019s closure of the investigation into Dapper Labs, one of the industry\u2019s well-funded companies, may provide some reassurance to participants in the NFT market. However, securities lawyers caution that not all NFTs can be presumed safe, as the SEC has already indicated that certain transactions in NFTs could be considered securities transactions. Legal experts such as Philip Moustakis, a securities attorney with Seward & Kissel, caution that the SEC\u2019s closing of the investigation does not necessarily absolve Dapper Labs of any wrongdoing or guarantee an end to securities-related litigation. Interestingly, the ongoing class action lawsuit against Dapper Labs alleging unregistered securities in NBA Top Shot Moments continues to move through federal court. SEC\u2019s Ongoing Crackdown Dapper Labs gained attention in 2017 with the launch of CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game that allowed players to create and trade NFTs of cartoon cats. The success of CryptoKitties led to significant investments from renowned firms. Dapper Labs further expanded its presence with Top Shot, an NBA-endorsed marketplace for NFT-based video highlights. However, the NFT market experienced a substantial decline in 2022, leading to layoffs at Dapper Labs. It is important to highlight that although the case above has been closed, recent developments indicate that the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions and crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry show no signs of abating. Bitcoinist reported on Wednesday that the regulatory body issued a Wells Notice to Uniswap Labs, the software development company behind the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap. A Wells Notice serves as formal communication to the company, indicating that the SEC staff has concluded their investigation and is considering recommending enforcement action against them in response to their findings.

This financial upheaval occurred unexpectedly on April 11 and has since stirred substantial debate within the cryptocurrency community. How DeFi Users Lost Over $26.8 Million in Liquidations? Operating on the Blast network, Pac Finance allows cryptocurrency enthusiasts to deposit their funds to earn interest by lending. The platform secures loans by ensuring borrowers receive only up to a specified percentage of their collateral, known as the \u201cloan-to-value ratio\u201d (LTV). Typically, any changes to this critical ratio are announced in advance to maintain market stability. Unexpectedly, blockchain data from the Blast Network revealed that at 1:06 AM UTC, a wallet controlled by a developer adjusted the LTV for Renzo Restaked Ether (ezETH) to 60%. The ezETH-leveraging farmers almost instantly found themselves out of compliance with the new collateral requirements. Consequently, this sudden change precipitated widespread liquidations among users. Read more: What Is a Crypto Loan? A Guide to Using the DeFi Instrument ezETH Liquidations on Pac Finance. Source: Parsec Such rapid liquidations expose the additional risks from protocol changes, which can be as severe as those from market swings. For example, recent shifts in Bitcoin\u2019s price resulted in over $500 million in liquidations on April 2. However, those were due to price volatility, unlike Pac Finance\u2019s protocol-triggered liquidations. DeFi expert Kydo has recommended that other Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), such as Renzo, should warn users about these high-risk ventures. Despite the attractive earning potential of staked cryptocurrencies, the unpredictable nature of administrative decisions can lead to significant financial losses. Following the turmoil, Pac Finance acknowledged that it was aware of the incident. Moreover, the DeFi platform claims that it is developing a plan with affected users to tackle the issue. \u201cIn our effort to adjust the LTV, we tasked a smart contract engineer to make the necessary changes.

El Salvador Hotel Project Will Require a Minimum Investment of $1000 Bitfinex Securities, the first regulated entity under El Salvador\u2019s Digital Asset Securities Law, leads this venture. They plan to finance the hotel project through tokens issued by a developer \u2013 Inversiones Laguardia S.A. de C.V. (HILSV), aiming to raise $6.25 million. These tokens offer a 10% coupon over five years, with a minimum investment of $1,000. Additionally, investors can receive free hotel accommodations based on the size of their investment. The HILSV tokens would trade against US dollars and Tether\u2019s USDT on the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain. Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex Securities, emphasized the project\u2019s importance.

This development has the potential to catalyze El Salvador\u2019s capital market and introduce a major new asset class to the market. According to Jesse Knutson, Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, this project showcases the transformative power of Bitcoin-based capital markets. It also contributes to El Salvador\u2019s economic growth by creating significant employment opportunities. The implementation of this project is expected to generate approximately 1,000 jobs during its construction phase. Moreover, it could create up to 5,000 jobs in its operational phase. The capital raise is scheduled to begin on May 13, 2024, and will last for one month. Simultaneously, the tokenization of real-world assets is gaining momentum worldwide. Circle\u2019s recent introduction of a smart contract for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) exemplifies this trend. Now, investors in BUIDL can seamlessly exchange their tokenized real-world assets for USDC. This functionality, facilitated by Circle\u2019s new smart contract, minimizes transaction costs and enhances liquidity, illustrating the vast potential of blockchain technology. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, expressed his enthusiasm for the new developments. \u201cTokenization of real-world assets is a rapidly emerging product category,\u201d Allaire said.

Sam Bankman-Fried Requested to Stay in New York Instead of California Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team, Mukasey Young, LLP, submitted the notice. They requested that their client stay in New York while the appeal process is ongoing. \u201cMr. Bankman-Fried respectfully requests \u2026 that the Court supplement its recommendation to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) by issuing the attached proposed order recommending that the BOP allow him to remain at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to facilitate to his appellate counsel pending the filing of the briefs in his anticipated appeal,\u201d Mukasey Young wrote.

Previously, Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried to be remanded to a low or medium-security prison near his parents in California. The electronic file for the notice of appeal was officially transmitted to the US Court of Appeals (USCA). A three-judge panel from the 2nd Circuit US Court of Appeals in Manhattan will hear the case. Experts believe criminal defendants have a slim chance of overturning their convictions in federal court, with less than 10% of appeals resulting in reversals. Should Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s appeal be unsuccessful at the 2nd Circuit, he would face the daunting task of petitioning the US Supreme Court to consider his case, representing an even more challenging prospect. On March 28, 2024, Judge Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison. Kaplan cited Bankman-Fried\u2019s false testimonies about his knowledge of FTX customer deposit misuse. Further, Kaplan pointed to Bankman-Fried\u2019s witness tampering attempts, which exacerbated his legal troubles. While Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal battle continues, separate efforts to reimburse FTX\u2019s affected customers progress. BeInCrypto reported that FTX plans to begin repayments by late 2024.

This reduction is expected to increase scarcity and potentially drive up the price, particularly if demand remains constant or increases. The upcoming Bitcoin halving has sparked significant interest and speculation, with many experts predicting substantial price increases. How the Next Bitcoin Halving Will Impact Prices Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price hikes following halving events, though not immediately. Hannah Phung, Lead Data Analyst at SpotOnChain, told BeInCrypto that price increases tend to occur around 6 to 12 months post-halving. For instance, after the first halving in November 2012, the price rose from around $12 to over $1,000 by late 2013. Similarly, the second halving in July 2016 saw the price of Bitcoin skyrocket from around $650 to nearly $20,000 by December 2017. The third halving in May 2020 resulted in the price surging from around $8,000 to an all-time high of $69,000 by November 2021. \u201cIn theory, the supply reduction increases scarcity, consequently driving up the price, especially if demand remains stable or rises. Moreover, the reduced supply also means miners have fewer BTC to sell to cover their costs, decreasing selling pressure,\u201d Phung emphasized. Read more: What Happened at the Last Bitcoin Halving? Predictions for 2024 Bitcoin Price Performance. Source: TradingView The cryptocurrency market has evolved significantly since these earlier halving events. With wider adoption and growing institutional interest. Indeed, demand from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may introduce additional complexity to price dynamics as well as the potential easing of monetary policy. For these reasons, some analysts predict Bitcoin\u2019s price could rise to $200,000 or $500,000. However, the precise timing and scale are still unclear. \u201cWhile past trends offer some insight, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. There\u2019s no guarantee the upcoming halving will follow the exact pattern of previous ones. The Bitcoin market is much larger and more established compared to earlier halvings. Still, I am very optimistic about a price increase after the halving, but the exact timing and magnitude remain uncertain,\u201d Phung added. Market Sentiment as a Barometer for BTC Price Market sentiment typically undergoes distinct phases leading to and following a Bitcoin halving. Pre-halving, anticipation builds, leading to a generally bullish sentiment. Post-halving, sentiment may experience a short-term boost as the reduced supply of new BTC begins to take effect. Investors should pay attention to several indicators during these phases to gauge market sentiment and potential price movements, including technical analysis, news and social media, and on-chain analysis. \u201cTechnical indicators like price charts and trading volume can provide insights into market sentiment. Meanwhile, news and social media discussions around Bitcoin and the halving can reveal investor sentiment. Analyzing on-chain data, such as active addresses or exchange inflows/outflows, can also indicate investor behavior. Finally, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs signify purchasing behavior,\u201d Phung explained. Read more: Bitcoin Halving Cycles and Investment Strategies: What To Know Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows. Source: SpotOnChain According to Phung, investor behavior also exhibits notable changes in response to Bitcoin halvings. Increased risk tolerance, a focus on long-term holding, and the entry of institutional investors are common trends. While a surge in buying due to FOMO (fear of missing out) might be short-lived, the increasing institutional involvement suggests a focus on long-term holding that could lead to a more mature market with a lasting impact. This narrative surrounding the halving may encourage institutions to view the reduced supply as a positive factor for long-term price appreciation. However, institutions will likely approach Bitcoin investment with robust risk management strategies. They may weigh the potential benefits against the inherent volatility of the asset. \u201cWhile Bitcoin offers the potential for high returns, it also carries higher risk compared to most traditional assets. Thus, investors should carefully assess these trends and correlations when integrating Bitcoin into their investment portfolios,\u201d Phung concluded.

This follows after two high-ranking lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday to discuss the way forward. According to the initial report by Punchbowl News, the meeting was held in Schumer\u2019s office, shortly after the Japanese prime minister jointly addressed Congress the same day. Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters Keen on Stablecoin Reform Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have, so far, been very consistent in their bid to see the committee\u2019s stablecoin bill passed into law. So much so that their efforts played a huge part in the bill\u2019s passing at the House committee, albeit with a bipartisan vote. However, not much progress has been made since that passing, therefore blurring any hopes that the bill may be passed into law this year. First off, getting a floor vote in a House where there is ongoing infighting, especially among top Republicans, would be a difficult task. Also, the Senate Banking Committee hasn\u2019t lent any support or has shown any interest in the idea up until now. Despite these potential setbacks, however, McHenry and Waters are not willing to give up just yet. According to sources familiar with what was discussed on Thursday, the duo is looking to tie the stablecoin bill to a must-move item, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending bill. For McHenry, getting his panel\u2019s stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign into law is one of his priorities before retiring from Congress later this year. With Schumer now in the picture, there is a glimmer of hope that legislation that will guide issuers of stablecoins may just see the light of day. As of publication, efforts to reach out to McHenry and Waters for commentary have not yet yielded any results. Call for Cooperation Meanwhile, the meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a wake-up call for lawmakers around the world. It is an encouragement for them to double their efforts in advancing the stablecoin reform agenda. However, as the debate surrounding stablecoin regulation continues to gain traction, it will all boil down to the collective resolve of lawmakers to address regulatory uncertainties for this fast-evolving digital economy to attain success in the future. next US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform","article_summary":"Coinspeaker US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform Reps.

As per data from Greeks.live, a staggering 21,000 Bitcoin options are set to expire having a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put call ratio of 0.62. The max pain point for the expiry currently stands at $69,000. With the US CPI data and inflation coming higher than expected, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced stronger volatility. On the other hand, the implied volatility has declined which means that in the case of volatile price movements, the BTC price can tank further under $70,000. Furthermore, the Greeks.live data shows that the sell calls have dominated the Bitcoin trade over the past month and the optimism around Bitcoin halving seems to be waning. Also, with the slowdown in the Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC lacks enough impetus to continue with its rally ahead. As of now, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been largely consolidating in a tight range between $69,000-$71,000. Analysts believe that it could continue to consolidate up to halving without showing any major price movements. #BTC is still just consolidating between these two levels No major trend shift as we approach the Bitcoin Halving$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3nYdfEN9Sd pic.twitter.com/iaAQn27Tuj \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 11, 2024 Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $71,000 Over the last fortnight, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has faced a significant struggle moving past $71,000, clearly hinting at a strong bearish grip in the market. Critics speculate that the S&P 500\u2019s recent decline from its peak of 5265 on March 28 could foreshadow an economic downturn. Given Bitcoin\u2019s strong correlation with stocks, which surpassed 80% last month, its price might initially decline if market troubles persist. On the other hand, the BTC futures market continues to show signs of neutrality highlighting a healthy demand for leverage calls in comparison to the situation in March-end. However, any kind of excessive leverage remains a valid concern with the Bitcoin futures open interest currently standing at $34.3 billion. ⌛️🗣️ As #Bitcoin has now drawn to its final week before the #halving, social dominance toward the topic has peaked at its highest level of the year at 9pm UTC.

According to the report, the number of financing in the digital asset space increased by 50% in March to reach $1.6 million compared to February. The month witnessed a resurgence in institutional investments, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s climb to a new all-time high above $73,000 after a two-year downturn. Pushed by positive market sentiments, investors directed funds into 180 crypto projects across various sectors. Market Dynamics and Investment Trends The KuCoin research found a continuous growth trend in both the number and scale of investment and financing projects compared to the previous year. The company said the growth signals a robust revival in the primary investment market within the current crypto economy. While the financing scale between $10 and $100 million notably increased from 16.6% in February to 28.81% in March, seed-stage financing projects saw a slight decline from 40.86% to 37.8%. Despite this increase, strategic stage financing projects surged to 22.83% from 16.13%. Blockchain Performance and Investor Focus In terms of blockchain performance, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Polygon (MATIC) projects attracted substantial investor attention, especially following Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions after the Dencun upgrade. While Bitcoin and Polygon remained strong, Ethereum, through its layer-2 scaling solutions, topped the chart after the Dencun upgrade. For active venture capital companies participating in the crypto industry, OKX Ventures leads the way, emerging as the leader among other investors. The company participated in a total of 20 projects in March, followed by MH and Waterdrip. When it comes to the top ten sectors that received significant attention from venture capital, key sectors such as Infrastructure (Infra), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Games dominated venture capital investments. In March, investment institutions favored themes revolving around AI, DEX, and Lending projects. Market Momentum and Future Outlook March showcased a bullish trend for the entire crypto market, particularly propelled by Bitcoin\u2019s surge to new heights.

This new feature ensures the security and fairness of crypto transactions. The implementation of this solution is a direct response to user complaints about technical issues and hacking incidents, showing the wallet\u2019s commitment to improving the overall crypto experience for its large user base. MEV Protection coincides with an upgrade to Trust Wallet\u2019s Swaps feature, which now allows seamless exchanges with over 1 million token pairs across multiple networks and providers. This dual advancement showcases its dedication to facilitating secure swaps in the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding MEV and Its Impact Miner Extractable Value is a concept in the blockchain industry that refers to the potential profit miners, validators, and other participants can gain by manipulating the order, censorship, or insertion of transactions within a block. These attacks exploit this vulnerability, enabling malicious actors to manipulate transaction orders for personal gain. They result in increased slippage, less favorable execution prices, and an unfair trading experience for regular users. MEV Protection: A Comprehensive Solution The introduction of MEV Protection is aimed at countering this attack. The security measure safeguards users\u2019 swaps from front-running and sandwich attacks, which are common tactics used by bad actors in the crypto space. Front-running involves exploiting knowledge of a pending transaction to execute a similar transaction before it, thereby manipulating the market price. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, require trapping a legitimate transaction between two malicious ones to profit from price slippage. The MEV protocol ensures that users receive fair market prices for their swaps, protecting them from the risk of paying more or receiving less than the prevailing market rate. This feature benefits both experienced traders and those new to crypto, creating a safer and more secure environment for all swap participants. Easy Access to MEV Protection Accessing this new feature is a simple process. Users can select the swap option from the bottom menu, click on the settings button in the top right corner, and enable the MEV protection features. This will also make it available on all devices connected to the account, ensuring a seamless and secure trading experience and automatically opting users in for an additional layer of security from the beginning. This approach further showcases its commitment to transparency and providing a user-focused Web3 experience. In addition, the crypto wallet further places a strong emphasis on user education and empowerment, ensuring that its community is well-informed about the security measures that it has put in place. The introduction of this new development has received praise from the Trust Wallet community. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! Congratulations on adding MEV Protection. Now we can swap with peace of mind.

The training, done as part of the firm\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility is to help bolster law enforcement\u2019s understanding of blockchain technology, particularly as Hong Kong continues its push as the new darling of the crypto economy. According to a local media source, the training sessions were conducted for the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) and Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB). Web3 Companies and Authorities Jointly Fight Crypto Crimes With the increasing prominence of Hong Kong in the cryptocurrency space, Bitrace CEO Isabel says it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between Web3 companies and the authorities. She maintains that the training is targeted at equipping law enforcement officers with the necessary skills and knowledge to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes effectively. Isabel, while delivering a comprehensive overview of crypto-assets application in cybercrime, highlighted some challenges including the fact that regulatory agencies lag behind in understanding crypto-criminal methods. Many crypto crime fighters do not also know that encrypted crime investigation is usually multi-layered, and the low efficiency of collaboration among stakeholders. The Bitrace CEO insisted that it is necessary to protect the security of users\u2019 funds and foster a healthier and safer Web3 environment by strengthening partnerships with regulatory agencies. The capacity-building sessions delved into various aspects of crypto-related crimes such as online gambling, illicit asset trading, money laundering, and fraud. Last year, Anatoly Legkodymov, the former CEO of Bitzlato, pleaded guilty to facilitating the laundering of illicit funds totaling $700 million. Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace\u2019s technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities. Real-life case studies were analyzed to provide insights into encryption crime methods and the flow of criminal funds on the blockchain. Bitrace Capabilities Beyond Hong Kong Police Training Besides the training, Bitrace also engaged in discussions with the Commercial Crimes Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau. The aim is to foster collaboration between regulatory agencies and Web3 companies. Prior to the training, the regulatory authorities have tried to keep the space sane. For instance, last month, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong had flagged suspected crypto fraud with HKCEXP to prevent users from falling victim to scams. Analysts say Bitrace is well suited to provide capacity building for Hong Kong police as it has advanced analytics capabilities, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms and has enabled the accumulation of a vast address tag library. This library includes entity tags such as DeFi platforms, mining pools, and digital asset exchanges, as well as risk behavior tags like fraud, money laundering, and illegal online gambling. Thus, by utilizing this technology, regulatory authorities can swiftly identify suspicious addresses and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto transactions. Industry watchers hope that the collaboration addresses the challenges posed by crypto-related crimes. This is paramount as the Hong Kong SFC is set to green light spot Bitcoin ETFs in the region anything from now.next Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace's technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities.

While the outcome did not guarantee an outright ouster of the current sitting president, Yoon Suk Yeol, all indicators point to a one-term tenure ending in three years. Furthermore, the opposition\u2019s landslide victory has led to the resignation of Han Dong-hoon and Han Duck-soo as the party leader of the People Power Party (PPP) and Prime Minister respectively. Notably, South Korea\u2019s opposition parties jointly won 192 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. If the opposition parties managed to reach 200 seats, the current president would be impeached. Nonetheless, the remaining three years for the current president will be extremely difficult with the opposition controlling the National Assembly. What South Korea\u2019s Opposition Win Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets South Korea is one of the leading developed countries that have significantly adopted the web3 industry and digital assets. The high adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets in South Korea, amounting to over 6 million people, had a significant influence in the just concluded parliamentary election. Furthermore, both sides of the political aisle had promised reward packages for the cryptocurrency industry if elected in the country\u2019s National Assembly. On one side, the PPP had vowed to delay a digital asset tax and allow investors to thrive in the nascent sector. On the other hand, the Democratic Party pledged to allow South Korean investors to tap into spot Bitcoin ETFs both locally and overseas. JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea's pro-#Bitcoin Democratic Party has won the national election to form government. DP: \"We're going to allow the ETFs, domestic or overseas.\" More than 6 million South Koreans \u2014 over 10% of the population own Bitcoin or crypto. \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) April 11, 2024 Notably, the DP party will need to overhaul the country\u2019s securities regulator that previously indicated that brokering spot BTC ETFs violates the law. The arguments follow data that shows that South Korean investors purchased more than $200 million of MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR). Additionally, more investors from South Korea have been trading crypto futures ETFs. Meanwhile, it will remain a game of waiting to see if the president will bend to the National Assembly\u2019s rules and vice versa. Market Picture The cryptocurrency market remains in a macro bullish outlook with the Bitcoin halving 2024 about 9 days from happening. The fact that the United States has struggled to tame the dollar inflation is a direct reflection of the global economic situation. Furthermore, some countries led by El Salvador have been purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and global geopolitical instability. As Coinspeaker previously noted, the United States Federal Reserve only remains optimistic that interest rate cuts will take place later this year amid the upcoming general elections.

In a meeting, several state agencies called for regulating P2P crypto trading and digital asset purchases to protect people from financial loss. Thailand to Prevent Scammers from Cleaning Money via P2P Trades In attendance were representatives from several agencies, including the Defense Ministry, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, the Royal Thai Police, and the Bank of Thailand. Others were the Department of Special Investigation, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association, the Interior Ministry, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, and the Department of Special Investigation. The meeting was led by the Thai Minister for Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Jantararuangthong. The participants met following a recent order from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. The Prime Minister gave agencies 30 days to disclose plans to crack down on growing online fraud. According to a Bangkok Post publication, online scammers take the proceeds from their illicit activities and pass them through crypto exchanges and trading platforms via P2P trading. This helps to minimize the risk of being traced, making it difficult for authorities to find and prosecute scammers. According to Prasert\u2019s ministry, 80% of the 100 million baht ($2.7 million) worth of daily fraud recorded in Thailand passes through P2P channels. The ministry believes this is an easy way for fraudsters to clean the money because these fund transfers are unregulated. The Minister tasked the SEC with finding ways to regulate P2P trades to prevent money laundering. No VAT for Crypto in Thailand According to the SEC, there are 2 million crypto accounts held by individuals in Thailand. Current regulations focus on regulating crypto trading, especially targeting unauthorized exchanges. The new effort is to widen regulatory activities to ensure that P2P trading is scrutinized as part of current efforts. However, Prasert assures that registered platforms will not be targeted: \u201cThe move to regulate the P2P platform would not affect cryptocurrency traders on authorized exchanges.\u201d The Minister plans to offer a regulation scheme to the Prime Minister if the SEC cannot modify existing regulations. In addition to P2P trading, the agencies also hope to tackle online fraud and call center scams. Thailand is working on establishing the country as a digital asset hub. In February, the Ministry of Finance excluded crypto trading from value-added tax (VAT) requirements to encourage the use of digital assets. According to the Finance Minister\u2019s secretary, Paopoom Rojanasakul, the vision is to support crypto adoption to drive the digital economy. The ministry waived the 7% tax earlier imposed on the crypto sector, effective January 1. Initially, for authorized crypto exchanges, the waiver now extends to all brokers and dealers under the SEC\u2019s purview. For regulations, the SEC and Finance Ministry are currently modifying the country\u2019s 2019 Securities and Exchange Act.

However, the path to scalability has sparked a divisive debate within the crypto community, with supporters expressing their concerns about the advantages and potential risks of various L2 implementations. If your Bitcoin L2 doesn't support unilateral exit, that's not your L2 that's a multisig. pic.twitter.com/Ors4ZvpmjX \u2014 mononaut (tx/acc) (@mononautical) April 10, 2024 A notable critic is the developer of Mempool, Mononaut, who has expressed their concerns about various BTC L2 solutions. Their critique covers a range of factors, including the involvement of venture capital (VC) investors and the issuance of separate tokens, as well as the centralized or federated structures that underpin some of these initiatives. The developer\u2019s concerns also extend to projects that offer reciprocal rewards based on user deposits, which they liken to pyramid schemes, and those that incentivize long-term lockups of coins, drawing comparisons to offerings like Hex. Additionally, he was skeptical of L2 platforms that lack comprehensive technical documentation, dismissing them as mere copies of the infamous Bitconnect scheme with a superficial disguise. In a post on X, they said: \u201cIf your Bitcoin L2 has no whitepaper or technical details, only 20 pages of documentation on how to deposit BTC and calculate your future yield, that\u2019s not your L2 that\u2019s Bitconnect wearing a false moustache.\u201d Echoing these concerns is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), who has openly questioned the effectiveness of Bitcoin\u2019s L2 solutions compared to the scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson argues that BTC\u2019s inherent design limitations make it incredibly challenging to implement additional functionality, often requiring the deployment of centralized or federated infrastructures \u2013 a compromise that, in his opinion, undermines the fundamental principles of the coin. The Optimist\u2019s Perspective: Envisioning Bitcoin\u2019s L2-Driven Future However, not all voices in the cryptosphere share this skepticism. Proponents of L2 technologies, like Yago, an X user with over twenty thousand followers, remain steadfast in his belief that these solutions will propel BTC to new heights, making it a cornerstone of modern civilization. He envisions a future where BTC becomes intertwined with various aspects of our lives, driven by the asset\u2019s increasing value as L2 implementations unlock new use cases and efficiencies. It is evident that both sides of the argument present strong and convincing opinions, stating the challenge of promoting new ideas while remaining true to the coin\u2019s commitment to decentralization, which has been the foundation of its success. The Layer 2 solutions offer the potential for the future of BTC by creating opportunities as the Bitcoin community continues to grow and generate innovative ideas. In recent times, we have witnessed a series of developments that have transformed the crypto space, such as AI-enhanced gaming in the crypto space and improved digital wallets that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and additional features for managing digital assets. Nevertheless, the full impact of these changes is still unknown due to their rapid pace of occurrence.next Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users The developer of Mempool Mononaut has expressed concerns about various BTC L2 solutions.

It eclipses MAGA and the Pepe Coin price predictions this year despite these two established projects enjoying excellent performance in Q1 2024. While MAGA and Pepe Coin prices rise, meme coin enthusiasts have been drawn to the Raboo presale, which recently launched at just $0.0036. As analysts forecast 233% returns during the ICO, it is no wonder many experts have Raboo topping their list of hot meme coins this year. Raboo: Meme coin newcomer fusing AI and meme culture Raboo\u2019s highly anticipated presale has caught the imagination for many reasons. Its fully audited contract makes the most of Ethereum\u2019s renowned reliability and security, allowing users to enjoy an engagement-focused approach. This includes prize draws, competitions, and regular events to keep the Raboo community fully engaged. The enduring combination of SocialFi mechanics and AI technology enables users to generate memes and share them across social media platforms in return for rewards through Raboo\u2019s unique Post-to-Earn platform. Other features include an NFT launch, an online marketplace, and several other exciting community initiatives designed to fulfill Raboo\u2019s promise as one of 2024\u2019s hot meme coins. With 233% price growth forecasts during the presale giving way to potential 100x returns on launch day, meme enthusiasts are flocking to Raboo, one of the year\u2019s hot meme coins, in their thousands. Pepe Coin price surges \u2013 can it maintain momentum Pepe was one of 2023\u2019s hot meme coins, surging to a $1.5 billion market cap within weeks of launching despite confessing to little inherent value. However, as the Pepe Coin price significantly surged in Q1 2024, the Pepe community has grown loyal, vibrant, and engaged. Pepe\u2019s integration of NFTs allows users to own and trade unique digital assets. At the same time, the Pepe Coin price receives boosts from regular token burns and excellent token staking opportunities in return for a passive income. With a growing community focus and big-name celebrity backing, experts back the Pepe Coin price to beat its current ATH set on March 14, 2024, sooner rather than later. Can MAGA go viral during election year? With the US election only months away, MAGA (Make America Great Again) and its native TRUMP token are enjoying serious price action. Although remaining well short of its ATH of $11.63, recorded on March 4, 2024, MAGA\u2019s current price of $4.64 is again rising as popular support for the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump surges. Whether MAGA can usurp its record levels and the candidate it backs can retake the White House remains to be seen. Still, with meme enthusiasts enjoying the wild ride offered by the TRUMP token, it would take a brave soul to bet against both happening during the imminent bull market. Conclusion While the MAGA and Pepe Coin prices continue to grow, having recently set ATHs, the meme coin market is bubbling nicely ahead of the imminent Bitcoin halving. However, both could be eclipsed by one of the hot meme coins joining the scene this year, Raboo. With outstanding features and enormous growth potential, Raboo could be the crypto find of the year.

With a very low likelihood of receiving approval, despite much attention being directed at the surging price of Bitcoins, Ethereum enthusiasts are anxiously waiting to know what the future holds for their preferred digital asset. While interest in an Ethereum ETF is declining, investors are looking for alternative ways to diversify their investment portfolios. One such project gaining traction involves ALGT, a native token of Algotech, a decentralized algorithmic trading platform. Offering the promise of advanced technologies and automation, this presents a lucrative opening for investors who want more than traditional cryptocurrencies. Analyzing Ethereum Price Amidst Halving Speculation With Bitcoin halving around the corner, many crypto enthusiasts wonder about Ethereum\u2019s future after this event. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s halving, which has historically resulted in a price boost, it is hard to predict whether the same will happen to Ethereum. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,503.32 with a 5% drop over the last 24 hours, but ETH experienced a 6% rebound from its March 29th lows, following Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 5.8% bounce. Despite these gains, bullish momentum remained subdued, urging caution for long traders. Technical indicators suggested increasing selling pressure and bearish short-term sentiment, even as exchange reserves dwindled, indicating accumulation. Overvaluation seemed unlikely due to the neutral position of RSI at around 50 and undervaluation according to the 30-day MVRV ratio, which implied a lack of any other wave for selling. Nevertheless, decreased Daily Active Addresses and a declining Social Dominance chart indicate weakening social engagement and persistent sales pressure that implies possible further losses despite the increase in Open Interest. Ethereum ETF Approval Doubts Grow Amidst SEC\u2019s Silence As Bitcoin approaches its halving event, there is speculation that the United States will not approve Ethereum ETFs. Indications show that regulatory hurdles may block the launching of such investment products despite investor enthusiasm. With the SEC exhibiting its unwillingness to consider and comment on Ethereum ETF filings, optimism is no longer there. SEC\u2019s May deadline could disappoint issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, which anticipate approval for Ethereum ETFs. Further complicating matters is the regulatory uncertainty surrounding how Ethereum should be classified, making the regulatory environment difficult for ETF issuers to navigate. Investors Flock to ALGT Token, Ongoing Presale Raised $3.7M Against the backdrop of regulatory uncertainty and ETF rejections, investors are turning to Algotech native token ALGT (ERC-20 tokens) as a viable alternative. The ongoing presale of ALGT has garnered significant attention, with the project\u2019s ongoing presale raising over $3.7 million. The platform\u2019s cutting-edge technology and commitment to empowering traders through intelligent trading strategies are resonating with investors seeking innovative solutions. Algotech offers a broad scope of algorithmic strategies designed to optimize client success and provide transparency and scalability. It strives to limit possible losses and improve trading performance within changing financial markets by having a solid technical infrastructure and sophisticated risk management techniques. Moreover, because of its decentralized nature, it ensures that its users enjoy safe and reliable trade. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving is a chance for investors to take advantage of both sides of the cryptocurrency market divide. Even though it is still possible that Ethereum prices could rise sharply, some regulatory obstacles seem to put question marks on its future potential in terms of ETF approvals. However, investors are seeking alternative options like Algotech\u2019s ALGT ERC-20 tokens to sieve through the ever-changing financial world.

How Does RABT Compare to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)?","author":"Will Izuchukwu","article_detailed_content":"The success of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu has proven the unimaginable power of community and meme culture. With their legacy as a backdrop, the crypto community is buzzing about the potential of the newcomer Raboo. The newly introduced meme token has emerged as a disruptor by offering something more unique while rewriting the meme rules with innovation. But can Raboo (RABT) carve its niche and stand out from its predecessors? Let\u2019s find out. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Experts Predict Imminent Surge Thanks to its charming meme prospects and sturdy community support, Dogecoin\u2018s playful beginning has become a cornerstone project. Today, Dogecoin continues its impressive moves after seeing over 200 million whale accumulation earlier this week. Despite trading in red, DOGE\u2019s whale activities have triggered a wave of excitement and speculation. The substantial acquisitions have sparked discussions about a potential \u201cbuying-the-dip\u201d strategy among whales, fueling anticipation for a bullish trajectory in its price. Besides, the upcoming Doge Day on April 20 has sparked optimism among the DogeArmy. The event aims to drive its value through various activities, underscoring a collective effort to push DOGE from a mere meme coin. Shiba Inu Breaks Above $0.000036. What Next? Built on Dogecoin\u2018s foundation, Shiba Inu (SHIB) aimed to overthrow DOGE as the \u201cDogecoin Killer\u201d and offer additional mouthwatering features. The dog-themed token\u2019s stellar performance has not gone unnoticed by savvy investors. Last month, SHIB broke the $0.000036 mark after recording a remarkable 38% surge. Despite the brief crypto market downturn, Shiba Inu (SHIB) maintains an excellent overall performance above $0.000026 support. According to on-chain trends, the surge can be attributed to new entrants injecting fresh capital into the market. Moreover, unveiling the 19th edition of Shiba Inu\u2018s magazine, \u2018The Shib,\u2019 featuring developmental endeavors within the ecosystem, has built positive sentiment around SHIB. Raboo Becomes the Crypto Presale Sensation Raboo (RABT) is fast becoming the talk of the crypto world. Since its introduction, the AI-backed Social-Fi meme project has captivated investors with its groundbreaking features set to redefine the meme market from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu\u2018s mediocre offering. The main theme of Raboo (RABT) is to break boundaries and set new standards. Its Post-to-Earn platform allows users to monetize social media content, tapping into the lucrative $62 billion meme coin market. But RABT\u2019s innovation doesn\u2019t stop there! Its meticulously crafted tokenomics feature absolute ingenuity. Raboo also prioritizes reliability and security for investors by leveraging a fully audited smart contract on the Ethereum chain. These and many other exciting features have shone the light on Raboo\u2019s ongoing crypto presale price, which is at an alluring $0.0036 in stage two. Despite Dogecoin price prediction, analysts project Raboo to surpass its predecessors with a staggering 100x growth post-launch. Conclusion The emergence of meme coins provided a more lighthearted approach to asset trading. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have established themselves with strong community support. However, Raboo (RABT) marks a shift from the norms. Its AI wizardry, inclusivity, and emphasis on innovative development set it apart. As Raboo gains momentum in the crypto presale, analysts anticipate significant post-launch growth that no smart investors should miss. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

Algotech offers innovative solutions in DeFi algorithmic trading, attracting investors seeking both diversification and technological advancement. ALGT\u2019s presale has seen success, raising over $3.5 million in two stages, with sustained momentum and growing investor confidence. Crypto whales play a very significant role in the advancement of cryptocurrency projects. In recent news, reports allege that whales traditionally associated with projects like Chainlink and Shiba Inu are making an appearance in the ongoing presale of a fast-rising DeFi project: Algotech. This shift in investor focus shines the spotlight on Algotech and begs the question of what it is about and why it is appealing. Beyond Chainlink and Shiba Inu: Diversification in a volatile market The crypto market has experienced incredible development, yet it is by nature unstable. LINK and SHIB have both experienced significant price fluctuations. This volatility forces experienced investors to diversify their holdings in order to minimize risk and maximize possible rewards. Chainlink has been a DeFi favorite for a long time, leading the way in decentralized oracle networks, or DONs. But there are obstacles to its domination. Layer-2 solutions and centralized oracles have lower costs and might be more widely used, putting Chainlink\u2019s market share at risk. With a passionate fanbase, Shiba Inu is a meme coin that has grown impressively. However, utility growth is what will determine its long-term viability. Projects with more to offer than just a devoted following may attract investors looking for innovation. Algotech (ALGT): Paving the way for DeFi computerized trading? Algotech answers two major questions. The first is that Algotech serves as an answer to investors looking for a better project to invest in for diversification purposes and a potential return on investment. The second is that Algotech answers the technological requirement for a platform that can transport crypto traders into the next phase of trading and investment, using innovation and automation. Algotech aims to open up the world of cryptocurrency trading to the possibilities of algorithmic trading often used by large financial institutions in the traditional foreign exchange market. This accessibility to superior sophisticated trading tools through the blockchain can now give an average trader a level playing field to unlock profitable levels they only imagined. Algotech\u2019s technology blends artificial intelligence and machine learning with other cutting-edge technologies. It is built with the high intensity of the cryptocurrency market in focus, having high-frequency trading capacity and a robust infrastructure that can execute a large volume of trades without lagging. ALGT presale success ALGT has sold out two successful presale stages, crossing $3.5 million at the second. Priced at $0.08, Algotech is in its third presale stage trade, with over $200,000 generated in a matter of days alongside the previous ALGT presale. For a project with an ambitious idea yet to be proven, ALGT has pushed beyond expectations and is still sustaining the momentum for growth. ALGT has gone on to double the initial funds it generated in its private seed-raising round of $1.1 million in early February 2024 \u2013 showing its growing investor confidence.

The token\u2019s all-time high of $757 was reached in March this year. A breakout above this could see Bittensor price target the $1,000 level. Bittensor (TAO) is soaring, and is one of the top performing altcoins in the market today. Per data from CoinGecko, the TAO token price has reached highs of $747, a 24-hour high that was just shy of the token\u2019s all-time high of $757.60 reached on March 7, 2024. Could price discovery mode for Bittensor see bulls target the $1,000 level? Given the catalyst for today\u2019s upside, it\u2019s likely further momentum could leave buyers eyeing the psychological target. Why is Bittensor (TAO) price up today? Bittensor (TAO) is a decentralised machine learning blockchain protocol that has soared in recent months amid the broader rally for Artificial Intelligence (AI) related tokens. The platform, which uses the native TAO token in its rewards system, soared on Thursday after Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, listed TAO. As with other tokens to hit the global exchange over the years, Bittensor experienced a major spike in price and volume following the Binance news. Per data from CoinGecko, TAO\u2019s 24-hour trading volume was over 400% at the time of writing, reaching $363 million. Is TAO price poised for $1,000? Binance\u2019s listing, which brings more visibility and confidence to the AI-related token, could be the turning point that elevates Bittensor price even further. Currently, the protocol leads the AI crypto market cap rankings with over $4.5 billion. Render (RNDR) and The Graph (GRT) are the two next biggest by market cap at $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion. The AI narrative remains strong and so does the crypto one, particularly with Bitcoin expected to rip to above $100k after its halving and amid the increasing demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. TAO\u2019s listing on Binance could bring the token to millions more, likely pushing prices towards the $1,000 mark. Other than the huge volume and the potential for a new ATH for TAO against the US dollar, there\u2019s also a big move for TAO/BTC. The pair rose as much as 28% earlier in the day.

Other exchanges, including Binance, have previously delisted XMR amid regulatory scrutiny. XMR price was at $132, largely flat after the Kraken news. Privacy coin Monero (XMR) has faced numerous delistings in recent months, with leading crypto exchanges ending trading support for XMR as part of their regulatory compliance. The latest setback in the regard comes after cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced an end to trading support for the privacy coin. In a notice, Kraken informed its customers it would delist Monero from its platform in Ireland and Belgium. The announcement, published earlier today, states that the CEX will remove XMR from its platform in the EU jurisdictions as from June 10, 2024. Ahead of that, Kraken will halt trading and deposits on May 10. The exchange will also auto-close any open margin positions by May 10 \u2013 which means customers have less than a month to close these positions. Meanwhile, XMR withdrawals will end on June 10 and if any users still hold Monero on the exchange by then, the balances will auto-convert to Bitcoin (BTC). Monero price outlook While Kraken\u2019s notice did not state the exact reason behind the move to delist XMR, its decision looks to align with recent EU regulation on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. The exchange therefore adds to the list of top crypto platforms to delist or announce plans to end Monero support. That includes Binance, which announced XMR delisting in February, and OKX, which ended all support for the privacy coin in early January. Crypto exchange Huobi announced XMR delisting in September 2022. Today\u2019s news has not impacted XMR price as much as the Binance delisting did in February this year. At the time, Monero\u2019s price dropped from highs of $166 to around $102. A broader market bounce in March also pulled XMR higher, with its price reaching $151. XMR is however trading near $132, largely flat on the day but likely to flip lower if bulls don\u2019t hold the key area around $130.

The country\u2019s financial market regulator successfully obtained a court order to appoint receivers for the digital currency assets held by a group of three crypto mining companies, collectively known as NGS Companies, and their sole directors. Bust of a Crypto Investment Scheme The court order, issued on Wednesday, was part of the civil proceedings initiated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) against NGS Crypto Pty Ltd, NGS Digital Pty Ltd, and NGS Group Ltd, along with their respective sole directors Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten. Additionally, the court has restricted Mendham from traveling outside Australia. NGS Companies offered investment packages supported by their cryptocurrency mining activities. These packages guaranteed fixed-rate returns as high as 16 percent annually, according to the company's website, with a minimum fixed return promised at 6 percent. The regulator highlighted that the schemes particularly encouraged investors to transfer funds from regulated superannuation funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs), which were then converted into cryptocurrency. The promotional material on the company\u2019s website, including \u201ctestimonials\u201d and \u201cstories,\u201d seemed to specifically target elderly investors. Regulator Gets Wary ASIC's action was prompted by concerns that the invested funds in these cryptocurrency schemes were at risk of dissipation. Notably, none of the three implicated companies possessed the necessary financial services licenses to operate legally in Australia.

The country\u2019s financial market regulator successfully obtained a court order to appoint receivers for the digital currency assets held by a group of three crypto mining companies, collectively known as NGS Companies, and their sole directors. Bust of a Crypto Investment Scheme The court order, issued on Wednesday, was part of the civil proceedings initiated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) against NGS Crypto Pty Ltd, NGS Digital Pty Ltd, and NGS Group Ltd, along with their respective sole directors Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten. Additionally, the court has restricted Mendham from traveling outside Australia. NGS Companies offered investment packages supported by their cryptocurrency mining activities. These packages guaranteed fixed-rate returns as high as 16 percent annually, according to the company's website, with a minimum fixed return promised at 6 percent. The regulator highlighted that the schemes particularly encouraged investors to transfer funds from regulated superannuation funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs), which were then converted into cryptocurrency. The promotional material on the company\u2019s website, including \u201ctestimonials\u201d and \u201cstories,\u201d seemed to specifically target elderly investors. Regulator Gets Wary ASIC's action was prompted by concerns that the invested funds in these cryptocurrency schemes were at risk of dissipation. Notably, none of the three implicated companies possessed the necessary financial services licenses to operate legally in Australia. ASIC is now holding them accountable for illegally marketing crypto mining-backed investment products. \u201cAustralians who choose to self-manage their superannuation should carefully consider the risks before using their SMSF to invest in crypto-related investment products such as blockchain mining,\u201d advised Joe Longo, the Chair of ASIC. \u201cThese proceedings should also serve as a warning to the crypto industry that ASIC will continue to scrutinize products to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations and to protect consumers.\u201d Earlier this year, the Australian regulator dismantled similar crypto-backed schemes that promised astronomical profits and banned a director of a crypto fund for dishonest operations.

The appeal was filed just hours before the deadline. SBF Appealed Earlier, the judge had ordered Bankman-Fried to be remanded to a low or medium-security prison in Northern California. This facility is near his parents\u2019 house, and the judge cited concerns for his security at a maximum-security prison due to his autism. Interestingly, during his trial and while awaiting sentencing, Bankman-Fried had requested to be kept in the notorious Manhattan Detention Center.

The appeal came two weeks after a US court sentenced him to 25 years in prison, along with three years of supervised release. He is also required to forfeit $11 billion.

The online frontier, however, seems content with pronouncements, leaving the digital equivalent of tumbleweeds \u2013 authorized push payment (APP) fraud \u2013 to roll unchecked. Until now. New regulations in the UK aim to be the posse riding into town, but will they be enough to truly corral this cyber cattle rustle? APP fraud thrives on a simple deception: tricking victims into authorizing payments to fraudsters. It's a confidence trick for the digital age, and just like their historical counterparts, these online swindlers prey on trust and exploit vulnerabilities. The fallout, however, transcends the individual. It erodes confidence in the very systems that underpin our digital interactions. The UK's new regulations are a response to this erosion. Previously, a voluntary code offered some protection, but it was akin to a town marshal with a single-shot derringer \u2013 limited in scope and effectiveness. The new rules, coming into effect this October, are a legislative six-shooter. They mandate reimbursement for victims of APP fraud, placing the onus on payment service providers (PSPs) to act as digital sheriffs, responsible for identifying and stopping the heist before it happens, or reimbursing the victim if they fail. This shift in responsibility is significant. Previously, the onus often fell on the victim to prove they weren't somehow complicit in their own defrauding, much like in a Wild West scenario where the bank, upon discovering a stolen sack of gold, demanded the depositor explain why they weren't more vigilant in guarding it. The new regulations dismantle this skewed logic. They recognize the inherent power imbalance between a sophisticated fraudster and an unsuspecting victim navigating the complexities of online transactions. The success of these regulations hinges on two key factors: robust fraud detection by PSPs and a clear definition of \"consumer standard of caution.\" The former demands a proactive approach from PSPs. Gone are the days of reactive measures \u2013 deploying technology and human expertise to identify and flag suspicious transactions before the money leaves the victim's account. The latter, the \"consumer standard of caution,\" is a delicate dance. It must be stringent enough to deter negligence while remaining flexible enough to acknowledge the realities of human fallibility, particularly when dealing with vulnerable customers. The UK's approach isn't a silver bullet. Just as the Wild West still had its share of outlaws after the sheriffs arrived, online fraudsters will undoubtedly adapt their tactics. However, these regulations represent a critical step forward. They move the conversation from victim-blaming to proactive security. They incentivize PSPs to invest in robust defenses, ultimately fostering a more secure online ecosystem for everyone. This isn't just a UK story. The rise of APP fraud is a global phenomenon. The UK's approach serves as a test case, a potential model for other countries grappling with the same issue. Will it be enough? Only time will tell.

But new on-ramps are emerging and Open Banking, a seemingly uncharted road, is promising a more direct and potentially more efficient journey. Open Banking, much like a high-speed rail system bypassing congested tollbooths, facilitates Account-to-Account (A2A) payments. Consumers can transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to a merchant's account, bypassing the card networks and their associated fees. This holds the potential for a smoother ride for both merchants, who can potentially reduce their transaction costs, and consumers, who may benefit from lower prices or special A2A-only discounts. However, the American consumer, comfortable in their high-occupancy vehicles (credit cards) and accustomed to the familiar rewards program exits, may not be easily persuaded to switch lanes. Insights from the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024: Sponsored by the World Bank and other key players, the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024 highlights the growing popularity of A2A payments. Back in 2022, only half of the jury members predicted A2A networks and mobile money would compete with cards within five years. However, just two years later, the picture has changed dramatically. Over two-thirds of jurors now believe A2A and mobile money will be the fastest-growing retail payment methods in their home markets. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Global South (Africa, Middle East, South America, Asia Pacific), where card networks haven't established a dominant position. Here, only 13% see cards holding sway, while 54% predict A2A or mobile money taking the lead. Existing examples like Brazil's PIX, which surpassed credit and debit card market share in 2023, showcase this trend's potency. The Global North presents a more nuanced picture. Here, expert opinions are divided between cards and the A2A/mobile money combination. While A2A payments have gained traction in Europe (Poland's Blik, Netherlands' IDEAL, Sweden's Swish), some experts believe cards will retain dominance. However, a third of jurors foresee ongoing competition with no clear winner. The Driving Forces: Several factors are fueling the rise of A2A payments: Open Banking: Open Banking regulations allow third-party providers to access customer financial data with consent, facilitating A2A transactions. Instant Payments: The rise of instant payment networks enables faster and more efficient A2A transfers. Strong Authentication: Improved authentication methods enhance security and consumer trust in A2A transactions. Potential Benefits: Lower Transaction Costs: A2A payments generally involve lower fees compared to card transactions, potentially benefiting both businesses and consumers. Improved Customer Journeys: Streamlined checkout processes and in-app payments can enhance the customer experience. Greater Consumer Choice: A2A payments offer consumers an alternative to traditional payment methods, fostering competition and innovation. Industry Response: The rise of A2A has spurred action from key players. Even in North America, where cards reign supreme, companies are taking notice. McKinsey highlights the potential for A2A to offer banks a \"more competitive way of making payments\" while providing consumers and merchants with more options. Visa and Mastercard are investing in A2A plays, and TrueLayer's new A2A payments app allows merchants to integrate A2A options into their checkout processes. Conclusion: Open Banking and A2A payments represent a significant shift in the global payments landscape. While the pace of adoption may differ across regions, the potential for A2A to become a mainstream payment method is undeniable. As the technology matures and consumer trust grows, A2A payments have the potential to revolutionize the way we pay, fostering a more transparent, efficient, and rewarding financial ecosystem. Yet, the revolution faces a more significant obstacle: the inertia of established infrastructure. Change, particularly when it involves money, is often met with resistance. Drivers, accustomed to the ease of swiping plastic, may be hesitant to navigate a new and potentially unfamiliar road system as it would be like asking drivers to switch from their favorite, well-lit highway to a less-traveled backroad \u2013 a more direct route, perhaps, but lacking the familiar rest stops and roadside attractions. The battle for the future of payments in America is not a race to a single destination, but a reimagining of the entire transportation network. Consumers, enticed by the promise of a more personalized and potentially cheaper experience, could become the loyal riders. But the established card networks, the seasoned highway authorities of the financial landscape, will not relinquish their control easily. They will unleash their marketing campaigns, wielding the glittering lure of rewards points as a well-advertised scenic byway. The outcome of this digital revolution remains unwritten. Will Open Banking and A2A payments become the preferred route for American consumers, ushering in an era of financial transparency and lower costs? Or will the inertia of the status quo and the allure of plastic's rewards prevail? Only one thing is certain: consumers are holding the steering wheel. Will they remain content with the familiar highway, or will they embrace the new on-ramp and become active participants in a financial revolution? Only time will tell who will reach their destination first in this high-stakes race for payment supremacy. This article was written by Pedro Ferreira at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"American consumers, accustomed to cruising down the well-paved highway of credit card payments, enjoy a smooth ride filled with loyalty program points and convenient one-click purchases. But new on-ramps are emerging and Open Banking, a seemingly uncharted road, is promising a more direct and potentially more efficient journey. Open Banking, much like a high-speed rail system bypassing congested tollbooths, facilitates Account-to-Account (A2A) payments. Consumers can transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to a merchant's account, bypassing the card networks and their associated fees. This holds the potential for a smoother ride for both merchants, who can potentially reduce their transaction costs, and consumers, who may benefit from lower prices or special A2A-only discounts. However, the American consumer, comfortable in their high-occupancy vehicles (credit cards) and accustomed to the familiar rewards program exits, may not be easily persuaded to switch lanes. Insights from the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024: Sponsored by the World Bank and other key players, the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024 highlights the growing popularity of A2A payments. Back in 2022, only half of the jury members predicted A2A networks and mobile money would compete with cards within five years. However, just two years later, the picture has changed dramatically. Over two-thirds of jurors now believe A2A and mobile money will be the fastest-growing retail payment methods in their home markets. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Global South (Africa, Middle East, South America, Asia Pacific), where card networks haven't established a dominant position. Here, only 13% see cards holding sway, while 54% predict A2A or mobile money taking the lead. Existing examples like Brazil's PIX, which surpassed credit and debit card market share in 2023, showcase this trend's potency. The Global North presents a more nuanced picture.

For retail and institutional investors alike, questions of regulatory and tax compliance can be puzzling. Then, there\u2019s the challenge of learning to navigate a new ecosystem. Using exchanges, sending transactions, and taking custody of coins can take significant time to learn. Fortunately, there are ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin without purchasing and holding the asset itself. This can be done in a standard brokerage or retirement account. This article will explore the avenues available for tapping into the Bitcoin market in this way, including exchange-traded Funds (ETFs), public companies with Bitcoin holdings, and mining companies. Bitcoin ETFs: A Gateway to Cryptocurrency Markets ETFs in general have become a popular vehicle for investors looking to diversify their portfolios without directly purchasing the underlying assets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a straightforward way to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated framework, and have been very successful since their initial launch in the US on January 10, 2024. The first gold ETF took 2 years to reach $10 billion in AUM. Blackrock\u2019s IBIT accomplished the same in just 2 months. Investors track the price of Bitcoin and trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing liquidity and accessibility to investors who may not otherwise be able to access cryptocurrency markets or don\u2019t want to hold Bitcoin itself. Some of the most dominant spot ETFs in the US include BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, and ARK\u2019s 21 Bitcoin Shares. Here are some important things to think about when it comes to selecting a spot Bitcoin ETF: Custodian: How does the issuer store their coins? All the ETFs use Coinbase as their custodians, with a few exceptions: Fidelity secures their own Bitcoin internally, VanEck uses BitGo rather than Coinbase, Hashdex selected BitGo as its custodian. Fees: What expense ratio does the fund charge? BitWise has garnered attention for having the lowest fee at just twenty basis points. On the other end of the spectrum, Grayscale charges 1.5%. Transparency: How much do you value transparency when it comes to your funds\u2019 holdings? So far, BitWise is the only fund that has published the public key to its wallet, allowing anyone to view the blockchain transactions that prove the fund holds what it claims to. Fidelity stands out, as being a veteran in the digital asset space that allows them to self-custody their Bitcoin holdings. BitWise shines for its low fees and transparency. Some investors see these funds as preferable. Others may opt for the reputation of firms like BlackRock or ARK. Public Companies with Bitcoin Holdings: Investing in Corporate Believers A number of forward-thinking public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, recognizing its potential as a store of value. By investing in these companies, investors indirectly gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. This approach allows investors to benefit from the company's broader business performance while aligning with their innovative stance on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy (MSTR) was the first and still is the most well-known company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company currently holds over 1% of the entire supply of BTC. Shares of MSTR have also seen impressive appreciation in recent years, even outperforming Bitcoin at times. Here is a partial list of other companies that have decided to put Bitcoin on their balance sheets: Coinbase Galaxy Digital Holdings Marathon Digital Holdings Block Tesla In addition to companies that hold Bitcoin, mining stocks can also provide BTC exposure. CRYPTO MARKET COULD DOUBLE TO $5 TRILLION: RIPPLE CEORipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicts the crypto market could surge to $5 trillion by year-end, fueled by U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and an upcoming mining-reward halving.

Investing in these companies represents an investment in the infrastructure of the Bitcoin network. As the demand for Bitcoin grows, these companies may see increased profitability, making them an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the cryptocurrency space. The recent rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price has been accompanied by an increase in the network\u2019s hash rate, as miners can create profitable operations with greater ease. Many mining companies hold some of the Bitcoin they mine on their balance sheets, making them a way to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and its infrastructure. A few popular Bitcoin mining stocks in 2024 include: Hut8 Riot Blockchain Hive Blockchain Bitfarms Limited Cipher Mining CleanSpark CRYPTO BREAKING NEWSThe Bitcoin ETFs Help Money Flow Into Smaller Projects And Their ICOs.

For example, mining stocks can be very volatile, even more so than Bitcoin. Yet they can outperform Bitcoin by a significant margin at times. Such securities require the highest risk tolerance and greatest conviction in the promise of Bitcoin. They can be thought of as a speculative play on Bitcoin, which may be too speculative for some. Public companies that hold Bitcoin provide a blend of exposure to the company\u2019s operations and their Bitcoin holdings. In general, the larger the Bitcoin holdings, the more the share price tends to be correlated to the Bitcoin price. These can be a great choice for more traditional investors who feel safer holding equities with earnings, cashflows, dividends, etc. The downside is they may underperform the other securities available. Bitcoin ETFs represent the purest Bitcoin exposure that a brokerage account can have. There\u2019s not much to be said here, as these shares represent ownership of a portion of the fund\u2019s BTC holdings. There has even been talk of ETFs eventually allowing shares to be redeemed for spot Bitcoin, although this is unlikely in the USA, as the SEC has required ETFs to be settled in cash only. The drawback is that each ETF issuer charges fees, which can eat into profits over time. When considering exposure to Bitcoin through your brokerage account, it's important to evaluate your investment goals and risk tolerance. Bitcoin and related investments can be volatile, and a strategic approach should involve due diligence and a clear understanding of the underlying market dynamics.

The figures stood at US$7.6 billion in January and US$10.4 billion in February. \u201cWe saw a pretty decent amount of crypto volume growth month-on-month from January and a huge increase in the last five or six months,\u201d said Louis Cooper, the Chief Commercial Officer at Axi. He added that the broker executed 1.5 million crypto CFDs trades last month. As much as 10 percent of the trades executed in March were crypto trades. A Significant Increase in Crypto CFDs Volume The monthly crypto CFDs volume on Axi for March marked a tenfold increase from the average of the three months between July and September, the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal year. As reported earlier by Finance Magnates, the monthly crypto CFDs volume on Axi ranged between AU$1 billion (approximately US$0.7 billion) and AU$2 billion (US$1.3 billion) for most of 2023. In December, the volumes surged dramatically to reach up to AU$6 billion (about US$4 billion), continuing the growth trend. The growth can be attributed to 25 percent of Axi\u2019s active client base, translating to over 9,000 traders, who traded crypto CFDs, marking a threefold growth from the first quarter of the fiscal year. The CCO of the brokerage highlighted that \u201cas an asset class, we now have more active Crypto CFD traders than we do trading Index CFDs and Futures.\u201d He further revealed that markets in Asia and the Middle East have a \u201cbig concentration of volume and customers,\u201d although \u201cthere is a huge amount of activity happening in other parts of the world, too.\u201d He added that \u201cthe vast majority of the growth came from our current clients who migrated towards crypto CFDs because of a moving market and increased volatility.\u201d \u201cWe're seeing new customers who are joining to trade crypto CFDs as their first. Although that's growing, it's still the smaller percentage.\u201d The Growing Demand for Crypto CFDs Axi offers crypto CFDs featuring \u201c30 of the most popular cryptocurrencies,\u201d including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash. Cooper revealed that 96 percent of the crypto trading volume on Axi comes from Bitcoin CFDs. \u201cThe approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US has been a huge instigator of the growth of crypto,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cIt's a validation of regulation in the US, and this is also a mark of perception from the market that there will be more institutional flow going into cryptos and particularly Bitcoin.\u201d Other factors that have propelled the demand for crypto CFDs are the upcoming halving event and \u201cprice stability,\u201d according to Cooper. \u201cBy its own standards, BTC has been incredibly stable the last 6 months,\u201d he added. \u201cClients are attracted to BTC/USD because there is enough volatility for speculation, but it\u2019s not as daunting as it was 12 to 24 months ago to speculate using leverage.\u201d Crypto CFDs are over-the-counter leveraged derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices by taking either long or short positions. Although other crypto derivatives offer leveraged trading, the leverage with CFDs can go higher. Axi offers a maximum of 200:1 leverage on its crypto CFDs. \u201cCommissions are pegged to the asset price, so transactional costs would have doubled over the last quarter,\u201d Cooper highlighted the advantages of trading costs with crypto CFDs. \u201cWe have resisted increasing our spreads as much as we can, which has given us a competitive advantage and our clients a trading edge trading CFDs vs. Perpetual Futures.\u201d \u201cThe costs, particularly cost to hold, are more transparent \u2013 with CFDs, you get one overnight fee based on your borrowing, for perpetual swaps, you get charged every 8 hours based on market volatility and trading demand \u2013 this can be quite low when markets are quiet but equally more expensive when the markets are moving (which arguably is when clients want to trade).\u201d This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"The trading volume on Axi with crypto contracts for differences (CFDs) soared to US$16.7 billion in March, the broker revealed exclusively to Finance Magnates.

Credit card transactions and other conventional modes of payment have existed for a long time. However, they charge high fees compared to crypto payments. This cost, borne by the supplier or the client, influences the final price of products and services. The High Cost of Credit Card Transactions Credit card purchases are now the most common way to pay for things worldwide, but they have a big cost affecting buyers and sellers. Charges from credit card companies usually run from 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, sometimes reaching as high as 6%. This may not seem like a lot at first, but it adds up to a lot over time. Merchants who accept credit cards are the ones who pay for this at first. On the other hand, companies often have to charge customers more for goods and services to cover these costs to stay profitable. Customers may not even be aware that these fees increase their prices because they are used to it. Because credit card companies have such a strong hold on the payment handling business, there hasn't been much competition to reduce these fees. Credit card companies don't have much reason to lower their fees because there aren't many other options that offer the same level of reach and ease. This means that high transaction costs will remain the norm. This situation keeps going in a circle, and the consumer has to pay these fees in the end. It's also ironic that people think credit cards are convenient, but they actually support a system that raises prices without really improving service or efficiency to compensate. The Emergence of Crypto Payment Platforms as Viable Alternatives While the digital world changes, so do financial activities. Crypto payment services are quickly becoming a major player in the market. This new generation of payment systems is making a name by providing a strong option to standard business methods. One of the best things about these crypto payment services is that the transaction fees are very low, ranging from 0% to 2%. This big difference from the higher fees that come with using a credit card could cause a big change in how people and businesses choose to pay. In a market that is always changing, Slash is an interesting example that shows how crypto payment systems can be useful. By setting its transaction fees at the lower end of the range, Slash not only beats the usual fees for using a credit card but also creates a new way to pay that is both unique and good for customers. Not only does this method help businesses by lowering the transaction fees, but it also ensures that customers don't end up paying more because of higher transaction fees. There are real benefits to the Slash model that could convince both businesses and customers to switch from traditional credit card companies. It shows how to create a sustainable and fair financial transaction environment that questions the status quo. Slash's Market Impact and Innovations Slash is a cryptocurrency payment service provider that supports over 1,400 tokens from five blockchains and serves various applications, including Web3, e-commerce, and retail. This sponsorship underlines Slash's efforts to promote crypto usage beyond investing and into ordinary trade. Slash's activities focus heavily on regulatory compliance, particularly in Japan, where financial rules are exceptionally stringent. Such compliance demonstrates a commitment to guaranteeing lawful and secure transactions, which addresses concerns about the security and legality of cryptocurrency payments. Slash takes a unique strategy by returning all transaction fees to its token holders, resulting in a mutual support network. This approach promotes community interaction and connects user interests with the platform's objectives. The cooperation with dYdX, a decentralized exchange, intends to expand Slash's reach into the Asian market by increasing the acceptance and implementation of cryptocurrency payments. This collaboration aims to increase market visibility and attract more people. Slash prioritizes user experience, with features aimed at simplifying the payment process. It supports diverse tokens, offers real-time pricing, and includes stablecoins to answer business concerns about price fluctuation. This allows users to pay directly with their selected tokens, making it easier to utilize cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases. Slash's strategy is a holistic attempt to incorporate bitcoin into the larger financial and commercial ecosystem, emphasizing innovation, regulatory compliance, and collaboration to traverse the shifting digital commerce and payment environment. The Ripple Effect of Lower Fees Crypto payment systems assist consumers and sellers by offering cheaper costs and changing financial transactions. Lower costs for enterprises result in lower operating expenditures, allowing for higher profit margins or more competitive customer pricing. Consumers gain from lower pricing, which increases their buying power. This synergy might boost overall economic efficiency and market dynamics. The rise of cryptocurrency payments challenges the power of existing credit card corporations by providing a low-cost alternative. This competition drives a reevaluation of price structures and services in the financial industry, creating an atmosphere conducive to innovation and consumer-focused solutions. Furthermore, cheaper fees offer side benefits: customers may save or spend more, while companies may see improved sales due to more attractive pricing and appeal to a tech-savvy clientele. This might encourage other firms to accept cryptocurrency payments, maintaining a cycle of market innovation and competitive pricing. The Competitive Pressure on Traditional Credit Card Companies The growth of cryptocurrency payment platforms undermines credit card companies' conventional dominance by delivering reduced transaction costs and increasing acceptance. This predicament forces credit card businesses to reconsider their tactics in the financial ecosystem. As crypto payment systems gain popularity among merchants and customers, established financial institutions may need to react by using blockchain technology to save costs and rethinking their pricing structures to remain competitive. Traditional financial institutions may explore collaborating with crypto payment platforms, combining their trust and user base with the revolutionary technology of crypto payments. This might lead to a hybrid strategy that combines the security of conventional banking with the advantages of blockchain. The rising legitimacy of cryptocurrency payment platforms points to a revolutionary period in the financial services sector, with established institutions reacting to retain relevance and competitiveness. This dynamic emphasizes the significance of flexibility and innovation in determining the future of financial transactions.

This decline occurred after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice against Uniswap, hinting at possible regulatory changes for similar platforms. FTX and Alameda Research Transfers SushiSwap Native Token SUSHI Central to the SEC\u2019s scrutiny is the debate over whether DeFi platforms should be regulated as securities brokers. Consequently, this has impacted other tokens in the sector, with SUSHI experiencing sharp declines. Operators of DeFi platforms argue that they merely provide technology facilitating crypto transactions without direct oversight. However, the SEC seems inclined to apply traditional financial regulations to these platforms. This regulatory clash is crucial for DeFi\u2019s future in the US. D.Jur. Nicola Massella, a legal expert at STORM Partners, told BeInCrypto that the resolution of SEC vs. Uniswap will be a watershed moment. \u201cIt will not only clarify the juridical nature of DeFi platforms but also set a precedent that could either foster innovation and growth within the sector or impose significant constraints under the guise of consumer protection and market integrity,\u201d Massella said. Moreover, market dynamics must have also been influenced by recent transactions where FTX and Alameda Research moved 2.7 million SUSHI tokens, approximately worth $3.9 million, to Binance. Since late October 2023, these entities have transferred substantial volumes of SUSHI to various centralized exchanges (CEX), with 1.4 million Sushi tokens still held in decentralized wallets.

The 99BTC team, seizing this opportunity, offers its learn-to-earn platform, a longstanding resource in cryptocurrency education. What is 99Bitcoins? 99Bitcoins has been breaking down technical concepts and onboarding newcomers to the crypto world for over ten years as the team can show by the numbers on its social media accounts: over 700,000 YouTube followers, 16,000 Twitter followers and 2 million registered users have confirmed its +80 hours of resources are a great entry point for those looking to learn more about crypto. The $99BTC token is its latest venture.

The 99Bitcoins team aims to attract all the potential new users who are expected to enter the crypto space and explore Bitcoin in light of the upcoming halving; the event, which will occur this month, is expected to increase the number of first-time crypto enthusiasts as confirmed by multiple researches and major sources like CoinTelegraph and CoinDesk. Pioneering BRC-20: Pushing Learn-to-Earn in new directions 99Bitcoins is also trying to set itself as a pioneer of the BRC-20 movement: a new token standard that allows developers to deploy smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Security and transparency are also key to this project, a Solidproof audit confirms that 99Bitcoins contract does have no potential issues or warnings. It\u2019s worth noting $99BTC is originally deployed as an ERC-20 token and that it will be bridged to BRC-20 only in Q4 2024, transferring the security of the project to the Bitcoin network. When it comes to the tokenomics (renamed to Token Metrics by its team), 99Bitcoins is distributing its 99 billion $99BTC total supply with the goal of helping it remain competitive and provide lasting sustainability: 15% is allocated to the presale, which is currently selling $99BTC for $0.001 14% for staking rewards, providing $99BTC stakers with rewards for two years 23% is allocated to project funds 17% for community rewards 8% to provide liquidity to exchanges 23% for marketing This tokenomics structure is then paired with an ambitious roadmap which would target the beta release of the platform to last quarter this year, followed by the full release next year. About 99Bitcoins 99Bitcoins is a vital educational resource for Bitcoin. It focuses on providing information about cryptocurrency to onboard new users to the industry. The website was established in 2013 and has since expanded its knowledge base to popular blockchains and cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.

In fact, the altcoin has declined by 30% in the last 30 days, in contrast to much of the market, with most major coins enjoying healthy rises in the last month. It\u2019s entirely arguable that such a fall is a sign of LUNC\u2019s ongoing long-term decline, with its community seemingly powerless to stop its descent. But while there may be plenty of better investment options in the market, some followers continue to hold out hope for a recovery. Terra Luna Classic as LUNC Plummets 30% in a Month \u2013 Is It Going to Zero? LUNC\u2019s chart looks pretty negative at the moment, with its indicators all pointing to further declines in the near term. For instance, its 30-day average (orange) continues to sink further below its 200-day (blue), providing a signal that selling pressure is only increasing for the token, and isn\u2019t showing any signs of stopping. Source: TradingView LUNC\u2019s relative strength index (purple) also looks bad, having declined below 50 this morning, and having struggled to rise for much of this week. In other words, it\u2019s a pretty depressing time for Terra Luna Classic, with its resistance (red) and support (green) levels also pointing to incoming drops. Another sign of just how bad things have become is LUNC\u2019s trading volume, which is minuscule at $21 million today. To put this in some context, it regularly topped $3 billion in the weeks preceding its infamous May 2022 collapse. This shows how it has never really recovered, and that outside of its loyal supporters, the wider market still doesn\u2019t want to touch it. Lot of procedural back and forth on Do Kwon's possible extradition from Montenegro. Now it seems like US may have first crack.https://t.co/qFTnJj89Go \u2014 Jacob Silverman (@SilvermanJacob) April 8, 2024 This week also saw a Montenegrin court approve the extradition of Terra founder Do Kwon, something which has hurt LUNC\u2019s price and future prospects. Looking at the bigger picture, Terra Luna Classic\u2019s future hinges on whether its community can improve its protocol and tokenomics in a way that restores confidence in it as a cryptocurrency and platform. So far, they haven\u2019t been able to do this, despite regular governance proposals that introduce tweaks here and there. It\u2019s possible that no amount of tweaking is going to restore trust in a failed project, although holders certainly aren\u2019t giving up hope. LUNC does not need any new charts, analysis, news, issues or fomo right now. It will just move according to the rules of the market. The deeper the correction, the higher the increase.

More Promising Low-Cap Alternatives For traders uninterested in or frustrated with LUNC, there are more promising alternatives to consider, with the market currently seeing a number of high-potential presale tokens. One of these is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based coin that has impressively raised in excess of $10 million in its ongoing sale. Exciting news for our lazy sloth community! Our airdrop is being prepped for launch, which means the presale is wrapping up soon. With Solana congestion expected to end in the coming days, now's the time to join the holy Slothana army! #SlothanaAirdrop #PresaleEnding \u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 12, 2024 This figure is a sign of Slothana\u2019s early success in raising its profile and gaining support, as is the fact that its official X account now reaches over 17,000 followers. There are a couple of reasons why SLOTH has grown like this so quickly, with its team having a pre-existing pedigree when it comes to meme tokens. Indeed, its team launched the successful Smog (SMOG) token, which isted a couple of months and made big gains over its presale price. Investors are clearly expecting that SLOTH does something similar, and its presale would suggest that there\u2019s a very good chance of this. It also helps that Slothana has tapped into some interesting and viral memes, with its use of the humble sloth appealing to retail traders who won\u2019t to make enough to escape the office grind. New investors can join its sale by visiting the Slothana website, where they can buy SLOTH at a rate of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH (about $0.019393 per coin). Prepare for the rise of Slothana! With our coffers overflowing, it's time to embark on a Sloth crusade to establish a global empire. Slothana's reign is imminent. Anyone who stands in its way will face the wrath of the holy Slothana army! #SlothanaEmpire\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TyFjlJTL8q \u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 11, 2024 Its presale is due to end very soon, so latecomers are advised to act sooner rather than later. Yet once they invest, they may be on course to make a tidy profit, such has been the growth of SLOTH\u2019s sale.

Philpott contrasted his experience in Abu Dhabi with the UK\u2019s regulatory environment, noting the latter\u2019s process is significantly slower with more complex requirements. \u201cThere were long delays in terms of entities getting their registrations with the Financial Conduct Authority under the anti-money laundering laws,\u201d he told Cryptonews in an interview Thursday. Similarly, he noted that Ireland\u2019s central bank had just as much of a cautious approach. While the number of approved entities may have reached the low double digits, it remains relatively low there. \u201cSo we found those processes to be quite slow,\u201d the co-founder added. FCA Resource Constraints Hinder UK Crypto Approvals Philpott noted that parliamentary committees attributed the delays in the UK to the high volume of applications, many of which lacked sufficient quality. He also acknowledged the FCA\u2019s resource constraints in processing these applications. However, he empathized with the UK regulators. Philpott said it is a challenge to retain experienced staff, as the private sector often offers them more attractive opportunities, leading to a constant need for training and knowledge building within the FCA. As a potential solution, he suggested an openness to the idea of higher compensation for regulators. Abu Dhabi Regulator\u2019s Collaborative Approach Wins Zodia Over In contrast, Abu Dhabi\u2019s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) demonstrated a high level of responsiveness. Philpott highlighted their prompt communication channels, indicating that inquiries received swift replies, even regarding complex ideas. He further emphasized the FSRA\u2019s proactive approach, recalling how it quickly initiated Zodia\u2019s licensing process within two weeks of initial contact. He characterized the overall experience as \u201cvery engaging.\u201d \u201cThey know their subjects. You can have very open and collaborative conversations with them, particularly around slightly unusual things,\u201d he said. Zodia Envisions Combining Standard Chartered FX with Crypto Zodia began its regional search in about Oct. 2021. At that time, Dubai was engaged in consultations regarding its crypto regulatory framework. The firm identified Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) as a regulator with experience in overseeing certain counterparties, including mid-chains. With the establishment of Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), Philpott acknowledged the importance of securing a physical presence within the Emirate. \u201cStandard Chartered is a major bank in the UAE. So we have a great opportunity to take their foreign exchange, combine it with crypto, and provide it to our institutional clients,\u201d he said. Philpott relocated to Abu Dhabi last month from the UK, where he co-founded Zodia Markets and subsequently assumed the role of Head of Partnerships. Prior to this move, he held various positions at Standard Chartered for about 16 tears. He joins Zodia\u2019s existing team in the UAE, comprising chief risk officer Mark Matthews, chief technology officer Officer Giovanni Miano, and Ayad Butt, who leads saeles and trading across the Africa and Middle East regions. He further observed the extensive construction activity in Abu Dhabi, which he views as a testament to the city\u2019s ongoing development and its \u201chuge potential\u201d for growth.

In the release the firms went on to add that success in this initial market will set the stage for extending their joint efforts to other markets, aligning with their shared vision of promoting accessible and decentralized financial services. \u2018Hong Kong\u2019s Crypto Regulations Might Limit Global Appeal\u2019 As reported earlier, HashKey COO Livio Weng has also raised questions on Hong Kong\u2019s recent regulations around crypto trading, expressing concerns that they may impede access for international clients. Hong Kong\u2019s regulatory framework mandated that all crypto exchanges operating within the city must submit applications for regulatory approval by February this year. In response, 24 companies, including prominent players such as Bybit, OKX, and Crypto.com, applied for these licenses. Crypto exchanges that failed to submit license applications are required to discontinue services by May. HashKey currently holds one of only two licenses granted for digital asset exchanges in Hong Kong. The other licensed exchange, OSL, recently completed a sale of nearly 30% of its stake to BGX. While details remain unclear, sources familiar with the deal reportedly described BGX as an unlicensed cryptocurrency group with ties to China.

Bitcoin remains up by 5.5% in a week, with its market cap returning to $1.39 trillion in the past 24 hours, in a sign of returning strength. And while it is actually down by 3% in the last 30 days, its 135% gain in the past year highlights its medium-term strength, which may only intensify in the coming months. Because with the next halving just over a week away, and with Bitcoin ETF volumes stabilizing and remaining high, BTC could see further rallies very soon. Bitcoin Price Prediction as Market Cap Hits $1.39 Trillion \u2013 Time to Buy or Sell? While BTC has wavered a little this morning, it hasn\u2019t suffered enough to derail its underlying momentum. Its 30-day average (orange) continues to rise steadily above its 200-day (blue), a sign that it remains within a growth spurt. Source: TradingView Something similar is going on with its relative strength index (purple), which has risen above 50 today and looks like it could rise higher, in tandem with BTC\u2019s price. Possibly the most bullish sign right now as far as BTC\u2019s chart is concerned is the fact that its resistance (red) and support (green) levels continue to converge, implying that the coin is nearing a tipping point that could result in a big rally. BTC also remains the most popular coin in the market by a very wide margin, with CoinsShares\u2019 latest report showing that some $13.5 billion has flooded into the coin from funds over the year to date. By contrast, its nearest rival (ETH) has seen only $52 million in fund flows over the past 12 months, with this disparity unlikely to change anytime soon (unless Ethereum ETFs gain approval). And as noted above, BTC still has the next halving to look forward to, and while this may result in a dip in the very near term, the squeeze on the coin\u2019s supply should only help its price overall. #BTC 3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving 1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace The Pre-Halving Retrace has already occurred and is in the books This Pre-Halving Retrace was -18% deep whereas in 2016 it was -38% and in 2020 it was -19% deep This Pre-Halving Retrace was the final\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xNqAL2cWd7 \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 12, 2024 The halving will also take place in a context where Federal Reserve rate cuts seem increasingly likely, something which will increase investor appetite for risk-on assets such as BTC. Based on all this, the Bitcoin price could hit $75,000 in the next few weeks, before touching $100,000 by the end of the year. New High-Potential Altcoins Bitcoin is the market\u2019s biggest token and is likely to remain the biggest for a long time to come, yet this doesn\u2019t there aren\u2019t other promising investment opportunities out there. There\u2019s also a variety of up-and-coming alts, with a number of presale tokens accumulating lots of promising momentum as they get ready to list. For example, 99Bitcoins (99BTC) is a new ERC-20 token that has raised over $160,000 in its sale, which opened earlier this week. Source: 99Bitcoins This is a very encouraging total for such a new presale, with investors clearly excited by the underlying fundamentals of 99BTC. Namely, it will be the new native token of the popular 99Bitcoins website and learning resource, with its launch inaugurating a new learn-to-earn model for 99Bitcoins. Launched in 2013, 99Bitcoins has been teaching traders the ropes for just over a decade now, with its presence and longevity giving it an enviable reputation within the market. This helps to explain why its presale has already had such a good start, with the 99BTC token serving to pay for learning resources, subscriptions and other services. As a token, it will have a supply of 99 billion, with 15% of this going to its presale, and 14% going towards staking rewards. Source: 99Bitcoins Interestingly, 99BTC will also launch a BRC-20 (Bitcoin-based) version of its token, giving it applicability within the growing Bitcoin DeFi system. When added to 99Bitcoin\u2019s strong brand, such features should help 99BTC have a very strong sale and launch. Investors can participate by going to the 99Bitcoins website, where 1 99BTC currently costs $0.001, although this could rise much higher once it lists.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF inflows reached $113.5 million on Wednesday, in contrast to the outflows observed at the beginning of the week. Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw its assets dip to levels not recorded since June 2020. That said, there was a reduction in selling from $300 million to $75 million.

Per the press release, customers can now get pre-approval online before visiting a Bitcoin ATM in person. The company said that this new process enables consumers to register in advance when planning to transact more than $960 per day. It is meant to streamline transactions and provide \u201ca seamless customer experience that maximizes convenience and security,\u201d CoinFlip said. Also, it will help prevent fraudulent transactions. Additionally, it will ensure compliance with regulatory standards and add a security layer to CoinFlip\u2019s compliance protocols. The ATM provider claims that, \u201cSignificantly reducing wait times and expediting the transaction process, pre-registration enables users to sign up in as little as two minutes from a phone or desktop.\u201d Also, customers get increased daily purchase limits of up to $2,995 per day (subject to state regulations) after they are approved. In order to pre-register and verify their identification, customers will need to provide their phone number and preferred currency at the CoinFlip Online ATM Registration portal. They will then receive an authentication code on their phone. \u201cOur new pre-registration process [\u2026] provides our customers a secure, efficient and seamless experience at our kiosks,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Ben Weiss. \u201cPre-registration means our customers save valuable time and we maintain the highest standards of safety and security for all our customers\u2019 transactions.\u201d Top Three Public Mining Hodlers Account for 74% of Industry Reserves Public mining companies\u2019 combined BTC reserves are finally back to the level seen before the June 2022 sell-off, according to the latest Miner Weekly report by BlocksBridge Consulting. Based on the published March production updates, as of March 31, public mining companies collectively held more than 46,200 BTC. The all-time high was 48,000 BTC recorded in April 2022. Much of this was sold off, reaching 37,000 BTC in the following two months during a broader market sell-off, the report said. Furthermore, the collective reserves went on to decline further. They hit the lowest point of 32,000 BTC in February 2023. \u201cHowever, in July 2023, a major reversal began, which was amplified in Q1 2024 as crypto markets became bullish,\u201d the report noted. Source: Miner Weekly Following the 2021 bull run, some companies held thousands of BTC. Then the bear market hit, and some had no choice but to liquidate much of their reserves \u201cdue to the high financial leverage they had taken.\u201d Others managed to stockpile their BTC reserves throughout the bear market, Miner Weekly found. The top three mining hodlers in March 2022 were Marathon, Core Scientific, and Hut 8. They accounted for 55% of the total reserves among BTC miners. Furthermore, Bitfarms and Riot held \u201cconsiderable amounts\u201d at the time. In March 2024, Marathon, Hut8, and Riot were the top three hodlers. They accounted for 74% of the total reserves held by public mining companies. Marathon alone was holding over 17,300 BTC. This amount was close to the combined reserves of Hut 8 and Riot. Source: Miner Weekly \u201cWith the next halving just less than two weeks away, it will only become more difficult for companies to accumulate bitcoin from mining operations at a cheaper-than-market cost,\u201d the report concluded.

Ripple Warns Against Deepfake Scams Impersonating Its CEO Ripple made an X (formerly Twitter) post Thursday, warning about the alarming rate of AI deepfake scams that are impersonating the CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The company said Garlinghouse \u201cis increasingly being used in deepfakes and other crypto scams promising free XRP giveaways,\u201d usually on social media platforms, including YouTube and X. In the videos, usually promoted as ads, the scammers use AI to clone Garlinghouse, promising XRP holders free airdrops or double-your-reward offers if they send certain amount of XRP to an address controlled by them. In March, blockchain security platform Guardio reported a deepfake ad on X, impersonating Garlinghouse to lure unsuspecting investors into a fake Ripple website for a reward pool of 100,000,000 XRP.

The growth is unsurprising, considering the proliferation of AI tools over the past year. In December, Cardano\u2019s founder Charles Hoskinson warned that AI deepfake scams could become increasingly hard to distinguish in the next 12-24 months as generative AI tools become even better. \u201cAs predicted, Generative AI scams are now here,\u201d Hoskinson precisely noted on X. \u201cThese will be dramatically better in 12-24 months and hard for anyone to distinguish between reality and the AI fiction.\u201d The problem of deepfake is not unique to the crypto space alone. Earlier in February, scammers lured an employee of a multinational company into sending them $25.5 million using deepfaked images of the company\u2019s executive during a video call. \u201cI believe the fraudster downloaded videos in advance and then used artificial intelligence to add fake voices to use in the video conference,\u201d said the victim, Baron Chan. \u201cThe people in the video conference looked like the real people.\u201d","article_summary":"The crypto industry is strongly battling with a surge in AI deepfake scams, which has swindled investors out of millions in recent months.

The talks will cover safe AI, the promotion of the diversity of benefits from AI, and reaching AI breakthrough boundaries. Advancing AI safety and inclusion The AI Seoul Summit to be held on a virtual platform in the morning of GMT at 8.00 and co-chaired by the UK PM Rishi Sunak and the President of the Republic of Korea Yoon Suk Yeol is kicking now. On this occasion, an agency will report on a given safety topic and share innovative measures of top-description companies. The next day it will be followed by a Digital Ministers Summit which will be organized by Zoom however Michelle Donelan is the UK\u2019s Technology Secretary jointly hosted by Korea\u2019s Lee Jong-Ho Ministry of Science and ICT. While we continue to discuss the future of the world, we also target AI technology issues of accessibility and equality domestically and globally. Both parties are equally using the conference for AI Technology development under the latter\u2019s progression and its issues are being addressed. The day we enter the world of even more sophisticated AI models is the timing for this summit. The emphasis here is on summarizing the importance of global norms-setting and governance to harness such innovations in a way that would promote humanity universally. Enhancing global cooperation The summit intends to promote regional coordination on AI security among world actors, the UK government proclaiming this as its foremost objective as expressed by Michelle Donelan, UK\u2019s Science, Innovation, and Technology Secretary. She focused on the fact that the Bletchley Park Summit was a historical event and had faith in the worldwide activism that guided responsible AI genesis. Minister Lee Jong-Ho also covered the summit\u2019s criticality, which acknowledges the fast-developing AI technology and international coordination that would enable the maximization of the benefits while controlling the risks. This addition to the Seoul Summit is undoubtedly a critical milestone in the development of a comprehensive international AI safety report. This report coordinated by the 2018 A.M. Turing Prize winner Yoshua Bengio gathers, for the first time, the cross-Alliance foundations for AI safety, expands the panel of researchers operating in this field, and integrates researchers from the UK, the Republic of Korea, and the rest of the AI-advanced nations. Strengthening AI through global collaboration and innovation The forum will not only be focused on policy-making issues but it will dig into why AI is significant in solutions for aspects such as climate crises and buying energy efficiently. The UK has set an ambitious target in the form of the Manchester Prize \u2013 a resource valued at £1m per year for a decade which is specifically focused on developing AI technology. Similarly, Britain apart from maintaining AI safety is the first state-backed institute devoted exclusively to research in this area. The Institute surged over its rivals, in that the quality of model safety inspection has already drastically enhanced, and a research team broadened. During the last month, the AI system signed a landmark deal with the US on recent AI safety protocols. The latter two countries adduce the significance of cooperation in AI during the summit preparations. The UK and the ROK are setting a global precedent by cooperation only in terms of ensuring the safety, inclusiveness, and level of consistency of AI development while addressing the critical issues of the modern world.

A video of a double in plaid pajama pants advertising a giveaway scam that is common was posted by the CEO. This scam offers that double cryptocurrency will be transferred to the fake wallet. In his comments, Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple would never ask customers for XRP. He jokingly pointed out that at least the imitator nailed his hair. This is Ripple\u2019s most recent initiative in its attempts to inform people of the continued misuse of his image and the company\u2019s brand. AI technology fuels sophisticated new scams For many years, Ripple has been on the offensive in combating the issue of cryptocurrency scams. In 2020 the blockchain company sued the video hosting giant YouTube. This lawsuit was in response to accusations that the platform did not prevent fraud in association with the Ripple brand. The company reached an agreement with YouTube in 2021, but this settlement has not stopped crafty fraudsters. Although the law tries, scams only evolve; they become more sophisticated by using AI technologies. Lately, a disturbing deepfake of Brad Garlinghouse has shown up on social media. This deepfake precisely imitated his voice, reflecting the growing risk of such technologies in illegal activities. Brad Garlinghouse urges vigilance in latest XRP update In a subsequent posting, Garlinghouse advised the XRP community not to drop their vigilance.

Including but not limited to admissions, teaching processes, and grading, all are widely discussed across different platforms. The role of chatbots is also a key point of discussion when it comes to personalized teaching options, but it has not been evolved for higher education yet. With the widespread use of AI technology, a breed of AI-detector apps has also appeared on the market. In the fall of last year, the Boston University AI Task Force was formed to evaluate the impact of generative AI on higher education and research and also to review the policies that are being adopted across BU related academic institutes, schools, and colleges. BU task force\u2019s recommendations for a critical AI approach These practices are not unique to BU, as colleges and universities across the country have been evaluating AI technology and its impact and forming policies and ethical frameworks around its usage. The challenging aspect is that artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t matured yet and is still evolving, and new breakthroughs flash with extreme brightness, taking our sight away for the time being. All this started with the launch of ChatGPT, which is again making a disruption with its AI video generation app, Sora. Looking at the advancements made in just a year, it\u2019s really hard to predict what will be on the table, let\u2019s say five years from now. Coming back to the educational prospects and BU\u2019s efforts, the task force released its report on the matter after consulting with faculty and industry experts. The report titled \u201cReport on Generative AI in Education and Research.\u201d highlights quite a few points, but the main focus is on dealing with generative AI with a critical approach. This is advised addressing the faculty, what were they thinking about students though? Well, maybe it\u2019s for everyone involved. It is also advised that students must be informed about AI in their syllabus and educated on its capabilities and usage approach. BU also published the views of some of the top professors regarding AI integration, Professor Yannis Paschalidis of Engineering, when asked about the \u201ccritical embrace\u201d of AI speaking practically, said, \u201cAcknowledge that AI is here to stay and it can be an effective tool that can be used to accelerate research and enhance teaching.\u201d Source: Boston University He also added, \u201cIn practice, this implies using it with caution. With the university adopting a policy to \u201ccritically embrace\u201d AI, schools and colleges would be guided to adopt their own local policies adapted to the needs of the disciplines they serve.\u201d Source: Boston University Professor Paschalidis says that the policies must be consistent with the broader university-wide policies. But he emphasizes that there must be some room for faculty to make their own decisions on the subject, to be adopted as per their class requirements. AI-detector apps and their unreliability The BU report also highlights the importance of usage of AI-monitoring programs, as students would be utilizing it already due to the availability of various apps and programs. But it wants to maintain and promote academic integrity and proceed with caution regarding AI. The AI-detector apps that detect AI usage, professor Pasachalidis views them not as bulletproof. That said, he asserts that these programs just provide an estimate of whether AI was used to generate certain text, audio, or video, but they are not 100 percent correct. So when assessing misconduct from an academic point of view, faculty have to be vigilant and not rely entirely on tools. Another professor, Wesley J. Wildman of Philosophy, says that instructors and students might be using the same AI detection software and getting the same rating as they do for checking plagiarism. He says that AI detectors are not consistent at the moment, and they are also not that reliable yet. This is a question mark for their accuracy and reliability, as they can be manipulated with spelling and grammatical errors to some extent. For this very reason, it is being advised to the instructors to exercise caution when utilizing these tools. BU\u2019s effort and undertaking this task to produce a thorough report on AI usage, Professor Pasachalidis said that the formation of the task force was done in the later months of 2023 and in spring 2024 semester. The board contacted many experts, industry people, consultants, and experts at their very own BU. They took onboard people from every discipline as they brought perspectives original to their own field regarding AI. All these efforts were carried out so that the university could have a unified framework regarding the technology, assign resources for training, and to adopt new ways of teaching with the emerging tech. On the same matter, Professor Wildman said, \u201cWe heard from experts representing disciplines not already named to the task force.\u201d Source: Boston University He expected that the important recommendations from the report would be implemented immediately, and some things might take longer to implement due to their nature and required resources. But the narrative of handling artificial intelligence with critical approach is being put into exercise without delay.

European decision-makers, as per the \u201cEuropean Connectivity state\u201d report, hold the general belief that enhanced mobile networks are key to economic success. Overcoming barriers to UK\u2019s path to 5G leadership and innovation survey revealers that 47% people have 5G internet as the most crucial technology thus magazine the metaverse, robotics and automation, 3D printing, and artificial intelligence. Undeniably, the entry of private cellular networks present great opportunities for UK businesses. However, not without obstacles involved in their development. It should be noted that 32% of all entreprises said their lack of digital skills is the main challenge, while 25% admitted that complexity of the realm of technological changes contributed greatly to this challenge. James Bristow, a vice-president of Cradlepoint EMEA region, stressed the necessity to conquer the aforementioned barriers. The only problems that will prevent mainstream acceptance of this innovation are the problems of security threats, complexity issues, and a lack of appropriate skills, in the opinion of our volunteer. Bristow suggests having safeguards in place and simple solutions with straightforward installation guide to which it could be a price to be paid to some tech leaders who in return harness trade relations for a better economic progress and to enhance UK\u2019s competitiveness in the emerging world. Transportation and education sectors showing the effects of inadequate connectivity Besides, noteworthy results entailed stark discontent with current investing level in wireless system commands, not in line with the UK government\u2019s Wireless Infrastructure Strategy. The study\u2019s key finding is that the present investments fall not only behind the technological innovation goals that seeks economic restructuring but also the sectors also don\u2019t see the current investments as sufficient. As an illustration, 59% of the respondents are of the opinion that inferior connectivity produces a situation where students struggle to attain indispensable skills and 62% of respondents agree that it is detrimental to the transport system. On the whole (in most cases), the responsible persons in the above mentioned countries feel that the sector of connectivity infrastructure investments will bring profit growth. According to them, 22 percent of the entrepreneurs are thinking to increase their it by 20-29 percent and the average number of entrepreneurs which looks up to grow their business is 19 percent. This optimism exists in the fact that the possibility of achieving sustainability is something available to 64% of companies having the smarter facilities being a driving force of their conservation. UK\u2019s strengthening 5G infrastructure strategy for secure tech leadership The next step in that road is the deployment of connectivity infrastructure that is in 42% of cases used by companies to implement technologies such as the Internet of things and AI to ensure this becomes part of operations. Nevertheless, the research shows that about 77% of such organisations are not sure that the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices incorporated in their networks is adequate for assuring cybersecurity, thus suggesting a \u2018black\u2019 area. This unquestionability is exactly the point if you follow the fact that 45 percent of the surveyed companies were attacked through their networks in the past year with 26 percent of these breaches being caussed by hacked IoT devices. The Cradlepoint report acts as a wake-up call for the need for more collaborate engagement and fund to support 5G rise as a way of securing UK the tech leadership and propelling it to economic sustainability through greening. In terms of the connection performance, the UK businesses gearing toward improving the current challenges in 5G deployment stands a high chance to reap the numerous benefits which is associated with the prospect of increased revenue as the case may be.

WRX is the utility token of the WazirX Exchange that was launched in India in 2018. WRX tokens established the roots of the entire WazirX ecosystem and operated as a good investment for all new users. Like all cryptocurrencies, WRX are digital assets much like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Binance has given WazirX the platform to operate via their channel. The Binance Chain and Ethereum offer WazirX users a 50% discount over the trading fees of the WXR tokens. Crypto investors see this as an excellent opportunity to make the best of this offer; however, the discount per annum drops each year; users generally establish themselves to the extent that it doesn\u2019t make much difference. The WRX tokens come with multiple uses and benefits; besides using them for trading, users can pay for their listing fees with their WRX tokens. The payments for fee margins can also easily be made through the WRX token, making much of the process hassle-free. Many of its key features are easily fulfilled with the use of the tokens alone. According to liquidity and trading volume, WazirX is ranked number one in India, having many users within the age range of 22 to 32 years. In a quest to increase investment in a start-up for crypto, the India exchange partnered with Binance in March 2020 to launch a \u201cBlockchain for India\u201d fund valued at $50 million. The WRX value hype can be traced to the update that WazirX is set to launch an NFT platform that would be the first to have content creators, Indian artists, and collectors as its primary target. On this new platform, customers don\u2019t have to worry about being charged for creating and listing non-fungible tokens. The hassle-free and straightforward route to acquire tokens is through WRX trade mining, airdrops, and partner-to-partner trading. New users must follow investment advice from a trusted source and conduct a personal technical analysis to choose a route best suited to their needs. Who are the WRX founders? In 2018, WazirX founders, Nischal Shetty, Sameer Mhatre, and Siddharth Menon, capitalized on the rising tide of retail traders investing in cryptocurrencies to build WazirX. In the first half of 2021 alone, WazirX has grown more than 12 times to become India\u2019s largest digital currency exchange and soon the country\u2019s first billion-dollar crypto unicorn. When the Reserve Bank of India introduced a ban on crypto-related payments. WazirX changed its business model to act as a third-party custodian between buyers and sellers. In November 2019, WazirX was acquired by Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as it debuted in the Indian market. Due to the continuing crypto debate among Indian authorities, Shetty had to team up with other exchanges to jointly engage the country\u2019s top financial decision-makers. Undeterred by restrictions, in June 2021, WazirX became South Asia\u2019s first marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a bid to help creators across India trade digital assets such as artwork and music. Let\u2019s take a look at what the future holds for this durable WRX coin. WazirX Ecosystem Development Nischal Shetty, an Indian national, created the country\u2019s first crypto, WazirX. This think tank, founder and CEO of WazirX, had been in the business for nearly a decade before he took this step. He began his Bitcoin mining career back in 2009 and ventured into Bitcoin wallets back in 2012. In around 2017, Nischal decided to develop more into the Blockchain ecosystem, creating the first crypto exchange in India. Following the uncertain and opaque standards and operating of other foreign existing cryptos in India, he decided to take matters into his own hands. With a brand new and locally run crypto, the Indian populace was sure to build trust into investing in cryptos. After successfully running Crowdfire, WazirX is another feather in the hat for Nischal, who has grown his enterprise into 19 million users locally and worldwide. He aims to provide an optimum cryptocurrency platform that is globally recognized and surpasses all expectations. This global product created in India has undoubtedly made its significant place in the worldwide market. Once the WazirX exchange was established, Nischal took it to the next level by creating the WRX token. WRX tokens have thus far had a successful run in an otherwise competitive crypto market. According to WRX predictions, it is pretty probable that WRX trades will stand out in the market. Legal Actions WazirX, the cryptocurrency exchange, has revealed that it took action against over 2,431 accounts by blacklisting them after identifying suspicious transactions deemed illegal. The exchange implemented this measure between October of the previous year and March of 2023. WazirX\u2019s recently published report states that they received a total of 431 requests from law enforcement agencies (LEAs) during this timeframe. These requests pertained to transactions valued at approximately $390 million conducted on the platform. Out of the 431 requests, 46 originated from foreign LEAs, while the remaining 385 requests were from Indian LEAs. Where to buy WRX Binance is one of the best places to buy the WRX token.

Conclusion WazirX\u2019s current estimate for 2024 is Neutral, based on various technical quantitative indicators. This could indicate that WazirX is a good investment in 2024.

However, this philosophy not only allows us to keep expectations under control but also is flexible concerning switching to a better performance. The major stages of effective AI scoping Specifying the scope of an AI project is defining the range of covered and non-covered aspects which is a useful resource in managing projects by way of rationally using resources and keeping the goal at hand. The PMBOK-s Project Management Body of Knowledge relates the six processes of scope management with the AI projects. Among these six processes, some key processes have an enhanced role. These encompass establishing the phase plan, requirements garnering, and work breakdown structure fabrication etc. For AI projects, the Certification of Project Management AI (CPMAI) methodology emphasizes the importance of three main steps: highlighting AI-specific needs, setting up measurable targets, constant optimization, along with the agile process. Through giving this much attention to these areas the project managers could steer AI objectives very close to strategic business targets, so that every phase will keep earning result to the business.

With this approach, teams are able to work on different elements of the issue, thus engaging in near term projects that have better chances of success with lower risks. The concept of iterative development, which is another important characteristic of the more successful projects of artificial intelligence, helps to answer this problem. For companies to be dynamic, in changing the AI projects, the stakehalers should be able to design and implement the work to be of short term and outcome-focused, where the iterations would not extend for more than a few weeks to comply with the fast-changing scenarios. Every one of the iterations has to be improved on the other versions and so the solution built up with each try based on the previous results from the real world experience and feedback. Scoping properly is one of the most vital tasks for infrastructure projects. AI project success is which can depend on how properly direction is provided.

NEW: 🇸🇻 IMF reportedly demands changes to El Salvador's #Bitcoin law for a $1.4 billion aid. They're scared 🙌 pic.twitter.com/vmqhts5dCY \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 12, 2024 El Salvador made history in 2021 by adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender under President Nayib Bukele. The country has since bet big on Bitcoin, building Bitcoin reserves, mining BTC, and launching educational initiatives. However, the IMF has objected to the Bitcoin law amid loan negotiations with El Salvador, which needs financing to pay debts and obligations. Talks have stalled for nearly two years over the IMF's calls to limit Bitcoin's scope in the country. According to the IMF's communications director Julie Kozack on last Thursday, the \"risks\" of Bitcoin remain a key issue in discussions with El Salvador. The IMF has previously cited financial integrity and stability concerns about Bitcoin. The fund's opposition highlights a clash over the future of money and payments. While Bukele sees Bitcoin as an innovative solution for financial inclusion, the IMF remains wary of its volatility and decentralized nature, and a threat to their dominance. Irrespective of pressures, El Salvador has stood firm on its Bitcoin commitment. The country has invested over $150 million in BTC reserves, continually buying more. Bukele also pledged to purchase 1 BTC daily. The IMF loan impasse puts El Salvador in a difficult fiscal position. By tying loan access to changes in El Salvador's Bitcoin law, the IMF is exerting its influence over poorer nations. But Bukele seems unwilling to back down on Bitcoin, creating an ideological tug-of-war. El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin adoption signaled a shift toward decentralization and self-determination. Demands to roll back the Bitcoin law undermine the country's monetary sovereignty. The standoff illustrates the disruptive potential of Bitcoin to reshape global finance. While risky for El Salvador in the near-term, Bukele's Bitcoin bet could pay long-run dividends.","article_summary":"The IMF is reportedly demanding changes to El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin law amid $1.4 billion credit negotiations, underscoring tensions over Bitcoin's disruptive potential.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 12 20:17:37 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712927857},"creation_date":"2024-04-12T18:17:16Z","type":"article","category":["El Salvador"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTg0MjMzMzU2NjAxMzM3Njg1/nayib-bukele-bitcoin-el-salvador.png"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin holds steady against economic headwinds, outshining Ethereum","author":"James Van Straten","article_detailed_content":"Quick Take In the midst of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to dance around the crucial $70,000 level, demonstrating its resilience despite the DXY index steadily climbing towards 106 and US yields on the rise.

This key development, as reported by Bloomberg, involves key financial players, including an international branch of China\u2019s Harvest Fund Management Co. and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital. According to Bloomberg, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong is to give the green light for these spot-crypto ETFs by month-end, contingent upon final arrangements with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. The anticipated approvals by the SFC are in line with Hong Kong\u2019s efforts to position itself as a formidable hub for digital assets. The ETFs, spearheaded by prominent financial institutions including Harvest Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management, aim to replicate the booming success witnessed in the US, where spot Bitcoin ETFs have already amassed significant capital inflows. CryptoSlate previously highlighted the progressive nature of these ETFs, noting their \u201cin-kind creation model,\u201d which could revolutionize the market by providing a more efficient and less risky way of managing assets. Unlike their US counterparts, this model would allow for the actual exchange of the cryptocurrencies themselves in the creation and redemption process, potentially reducing costs and improving liquidity. Furthermore, the strategic launch of these ETFs is seen as a strategic move to capitalize on the burgeoning demand within the Asian financial markets. This comes at a time when the global acceptance of such financial products is seeing a substantial uptick, spurred by successful launches and significant inflows in the US. Since their introduction, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen tens of billions in net inflow, bolstering Bitcoin\u2019s price surge. The success of these ETFs could bring several benefits to the Hong Kong market. These include enhancing investor protection, promoting orderly market conditions for underlying cryptocurrencies, and facilitating the integration of digital asset platforms with traditional financial institutions. However, challenges concerning fee structures and regulatory compliance remain, with a strong call for maintaining reasonable fees and stringent custodial standards to safeguard investors\u2019 interests. Moreover, the rollout of these ETFs is expected to attract new investments to the broader Asian region. This anticipation builds on the recent regulatory advancements that have seen the SFC update its list of virtual asset management funds, indicating a more receptive regulatory environment. The impending upcoming approval and launch of Hong Kong\u2019s first spot-crypto ETFs will represent a significant milestone in the maturation of digital assets investments in the region.

Following a peak at a 23-month high at $0.808 on March 11, the price of ADA has fallen by over 28%, and it is now hovering just below the $0.60 level. Notably, Cardano has underperformed compared to its competitors, slipping to the 10th position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. However, a crypto analyst, known as Trend Rider (@TrendRidersTR) on X, has declared that ADA is showing clear signs of a bull run based on technical analysis of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossovers. What This Means For Cardano Price According to Trend Rider\u2019s recent post on X, Cardano\u2019s current market behavior mirrors a rare pattern in the one month chart (ADA/USD) observed only once before, which led to a significant price surge from $0.05 to $3.00. The analyst emphasized, \u201cADA\u2019s undeniable bull run is here. With its second RSI crossover in history, it\u2019s reminiscent of when prices soared from $0.05 to $3. This rare event, marking a potential trend shift as the RSI crosses its SMA, has flawlessly predicted past cycles shifts at it\u2019s early stages.\u201d The analysis presented by Trend Rider focuses on the RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, and its crossover with the SMA, a common trading signal interpreted as a potential bullish or bearish market indicator. The post details three critical phases in Cardano\u2019s recent market activity. The first crossover occurred shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic onset when ADA traded at $0.19, marked by a substantial price increase following the crossover event. At the end of the 2021 bull run, a bearish crossover took place that heralded a prolonged bear market. \u201cNotice how perfect the bearish crossover anticipated the bear market. This is an extremely strong validation for this indicator. Making it very relevant to predict ADA long term cycles,\u201d the analyst states. The second bullish crossover of the RSI with the SMA occurred in October and November 2023, this event was initially met with market rejection a few months earlier, adding credibility to the indicator\u2019s reliability in predicting long-term market trends. Trend Rider concludes, \u201cThe RSI and its SMA crossovers are an extremely reliable source to identify ADA bull runs and bear markets at its early stages.\u201d This analysis suggests that Cardano is currently entering a bull market phase, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for ADA. Moreover, the analyst warned the one-month chart reflects a macro perspective for holders, \u201ceach candle represents one month, so you can expect huge volatility within each candle.\u201d Furthermore, he cautioned of the inherent risks in crypto investments, noting the importance of a personalized investment strategy to navigate potential market volatility and unforeseen events, often referred to as \u2018black swan\u2019 events. \u201cVERY IMPORTANT: Personally, these macro charts help me see the bigger picture, but I always use my own process to secure profits and protect myself from any black swan event,\u201d Trend Rider added.

His statement comes amid concerns about outflows from the fund, which have continued to overwhelm the Bitcoin ecosystem. GBTC Fees Will Drop When This Happens According to a Cointelegraph report, Sonnenshein mentioned during an interview at Canaccord Genuity\u2019s Digital Assets Symposium that GBTC fees will only drop when the Spot Bitcoin ETFs \u201cstart to mature.\u201d GBTC has the highest fees among all the Spot Bitcoin ETFs with a management fee of 1.5%, compared to the others, which have fees that range between 0.19% to 0.39%. However, Grayscale\u2019s CEO doesn\u2019t look so concerned. He said he is happy to wait despite GBTC boasting the most outflows among its competition, an occurrence which could be partly due to its high fees. Meanwhile, Sonnenshein elaborated on what it means for Spot Bitcoin ETFs to mature. He remarked that the market will consolidate once this happens, and investors will shift their attention to only a few of these ETFs. For now, he believes that these products are still in the first wave of adoption, and investors are still underinvested in them. \u201cThose things really haven\u2019t started happening yet,\u201d Sonnenshein claimed while suggesting there will be so much room for growth for these Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Once this first wave of adoption, he stated that fees would come down over time, which would also cause them to reduce fees on GBTC. He further suggested that this next phase of adoption. Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows On The Rise Grayscale\u2019s GBTC outflows are again on the rise, having slowed at some point last month. Data from Farside Investors shows that the fund has recorded net outflows this week. Its largest outflow this week came on April 8, with $303.3 million flowing out of the fund. Meanwhile, it recorded an outflow of $154.9 million, $17.5 million, and $124.9 million on April 9, 10, and 11, respectively. The rise in GBTC\u2019s outflows follows Michael Sonnenshein\u2019s recent interview, in which he shared his belief that the fund has begun to reach an equilibrium. He stated that some of the anticipated outflows are largely behind them now. Since converting to a Spot Bitcoin ETF, GBTC has experienced over $15 billion in outflows, negatively impacting Bitcoin\u2019s price at different times. Grayscale has had to offload some of its Bitcoin holdings to fulfill these redemptions, adding significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. Interestingly, Grayscale still holds the most BTC (319,252 BTC) among all the Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. This is because it had a first-mover advantage, having operated as a close-end fund before the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved on January 11.","article_summary":"Grayscale\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Michael Sonnenshein recently revealed when his company will reduce fund fees for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

Particularly, this decision concerns the power of the regulatory watchdog to request disgorgement, an important tool for enforcement, in situations involving securities offenses. Ripple CLO Highlights Setback For US SEC Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty, reported that the Commission keeps suffering legal defeats in the Govil case. According to Aldeorty, the agency experienced another setback after the Second Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reexamine its ruling in Govil, which maintained that the SEC is not entitled to disgorgement from the seller if there is no financial harm to the buyer. The filing read: Appellee, Securities and Exchange Commission, filed a petition for panel rehearing, or, in the alternative, for rehearing en banc. The panel that determined the appeal has considered the request for panel rehearing, and the active members of the Court have considered the request for rehearing en banc. It is hereby ordered that the petition is denied. Notably, the agency previously suffered a setback, which Alderoty drew the community\u2019s attention to in his X post. In November last year, the SEC accused Govil of inducing his former company, Cemtrex, to issue securities under pretenses, promising investors that the $7.3 million they contributed would be used for business expenses. Meanwhile, they were utilized to support other business endeavors and the defendant\u2019s personal fees. As part of a settlement, Govil offered all of its shares in the company, which both entities estimated to be worth roughly $5.6 million. It also gave Cemtrex an extra $1.5 million in the form of a secured promissory note. Consequently, the SEC demanded $5.8 million in disgorgement minus the promissory note\u2019s face value. However, the Court ruled that the SEC cannot request a crushing disgorgement award without first demonstrating that \u201cinvestors\u201d had sustained financial harm. This is because there will be no penalties without concrete proof of harm. Alderoty reporting of this verdict highlights its ramifications for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole, as well as regulatory enforcement tactics. Furthermore, it underlines the ongoing legal disputes and regulatory uncertainty that firms like Ripple must deal with in the context of changing regulatory frameworks. What This Could Mean For The Regulatory Body These negative developments do not look good for the Commission, as they could be viewed as inaccurate decisions from the body. Additionally, it can also be considered an abuse of authority since there are already speculations that the SEC enforcement actions are exceeding its jurisdiction. With the Commission\u2019s recent legal misfortune, Ripple and its devoted community are commemorating the major win.

JetMoE-8B is trained at less than a $0.1 million cost but outperforms LLaMA2-7B from Meta AI (multi-billion dollar compute cost) MyShell: \u201cAchieving LlaMA2 performance with the $100,000 JetMoE model, inspired by the sparse activation architecture of ModuleFormer, signifies a remarkable milestone in machine learning. The JetMoE-8B, with its 8 billion parameters and sophisticated structure of 24 blocks, each housing two MoE layers (Attention Head Mixture and MLP Experts Mixture), showcases advanced efficiency and computational intelligence. Each layer\u2019s selective activation of 2 out of 8 experts per input token demonstrates a refined utilization of the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) framework, enhancing the model\u2019s responsiveness and resource management.\u201d The efficiency of JetMoE-8B, with its 2.2 billion activation parameters, significantly lowered training costs while delivering robust performance. The model\u2019s effectiveness is illustrated in the subsequent figure: JetMoE-8B achieved state-of-the-art results in five categories on eight evaluation benchmarks, outperforming competitors like LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B, and DeepseekMoE-16B. On the MT-Bench benchmark, JetMoE-8B scored 6.681, surpassing models with larger capacities, such as LLaMA2 and Vicuna, which possess 13 billion parameters. But what superpowers this architectural sophistication is Exabits\u2019 contribution of an accelerated and stabilized cluster of 12 H100 GPU nodes (96 GPUs). Exabits\u2019 platform played a pivotal role in powering the JetMoE model, ensuring stable, ultra-available and robust performance at a fraction of the cost of \u201cbig compute.\u201d This synergy between JetMoE\u2019s innovative design and Exabits\u2019 cutting-edge GPU technology not only exemplifies a leap in machine learning capabilities but also highlights the effectiveness of combining advanced model architectures with Exabits\u2019 cloud compute infrastructure. Breaking the Myth: Decentralized GPU Platform for LLM Training Exabits has disproved the skepticism that decentralized GPU platforms are unsuitable for LLM training. With a sophisticated technical stack, efficient middleware, and a robust supply chain of computational resources, Exabits has demonstrated that LLM training and inference are not only possible but also efficient and deeply cost-effective on such a platform. Exabits, a decentralized cloud compute platform, overcomes the limitations of standard decentralized platforms by serving as the infrastructure base layer of AI computing and offering a full-stack solution. It does this by aggregating, accelerating, and stabilizing consumer-grade GPUs to match enterprise-grade GPU performance to almost parity. This approach taps into a vast, yet largely idle reserve of consumer GPUs, easing the GPU shortage crisis.

There\u2019s a possibility that SOL might reach around $130 as part of this correction, BeInCrypto analyzes the price charts. Solana\u2019s Price Rebounds from 50-Day EMA The day before yesterday, Solana reached the 50-day EMA support at the 0.382 Fib level, approximately at $160, and rebounded strongly. Currently, the SOL price faces significant Fib resistances around $180 and $195. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram has shown bullish momentum over the past three days. However, the MACD lines are bearishly crossed, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral. Solana (SOL) Price Chart.

Nonetheless, the corrective phase will only conclude if Solana surpasses the golden ratio of around $195. Solana\u2019s 4H Chart Alert: Is a Death Cross on the Horizon? In the 4-hour chart, the MACD lines are in a bullish crossover, while the histogram fluctuates between bullish and bearish movements.

However, they are approaching closely, potentially leading to a Death Cross. Solana (SOL) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Such a development would affirm a short-term bearish trend. Solana\u2019s Tough Week: Price Dips Over 20% Since our cautionary note on a potential correction in Solana when its price hovered around $190, it has indeed experienced a decline of over 20% from its weekly peak of approximately $205. Consequently, the MACD histogram has shown a bearish trend since the previous week. Despite this, the MACD lines maintain their bullish crossover while the RSI gradually transitions from overbought territories to a neutral stance. Presently, robust Fibonacci supports are observed around $160 and $130. In the event of a severe correction, Solana could potentially retreat to the golden ratio support near $85. Solana (SOL) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview At this level, the 50-week EMA serves as an additional pillar of support. It\u2019s worth noting that such a pronounced correction wouldn\u2019t invalidate the overall bullish trend, as significant volatility is characteristic of the cryptocurrency realm. Therefore, it remains a plausible scenario. MACD Histogram Signals Downturn in Coming Month The MACD histogram may exhibit a bearish trend in the current month. Presently, the MACD retains its predominantly bullish stance, as evidenced by the bullish crossover of the MACD lines and the upward trajectory of the histogram. Solana (SOL) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Furthermore, the RSI is progressively transitioning from overbought levels towards neutral territory. Solana vs. Bitcoin: Anticipating a Bullish Bounce at Fibonacci Support A notably distinct scenario has unfolded concerning Solana\u2019s performance against Bitcoin. Following a bearish divergence observed in the weekly RSI, the Solana price faced a bearish rejection at the Golden Ratio resistance level of around 0.003 BTC. Read More: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030 This development suggests a potential bullish rebound for Solana, with the possibility of the price bouncing off Fibonacci supports ranging from approximately 0.0021 BTC to 0.0023 BTC, initiating an upward trajectory. SOL/BTC Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Alternatively, should the price fail to find support within the aforementioned range, significant support is anticipated around 0.00145 BTC.

According to Bloomberg, sources close to the matter indicate that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) may grant approval as early as Monday. However, this decision might be subject to last-minute changes. Which Issuers Are Likely Recipients of Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF Approvals The likely recipients of these approvals are notable firms in the asset management industry. An international division of Harvest Fund Management, alongside a joint venture between Bosera Asset Management (International) and HashKey Capital, is expected to secure permissions to launch these spot-crypto ETFs. Pending regulatory approval and final discussions with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., both plan to debut the ETFs by month-end. Following recent regulatory approvals, these developments highlight Hong Kong\u2019s aggressive approach to integrating cryptocurrencies into its financial systems. Earlier in April, the SFC authorized Harvest and China Asset Management to manage funds related to virtual assets. Read more: What Is a Bitcoin ETF? This move is part of a broader effort to embrace and regulate the crypto sector. The introduction of spot ETFs in Hong Kong reflects the significant success of similar products in the United States. Since launching in January, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted approximately $59 billion in assets. This influx has significantly boosted Bitcoin\u2019s value, demonstrating the potential impact of Hong Kong\u2019s new ETFs. Despite its forward-thinking regulations, Hong Kong faces stiff competition from cities like Singapore and Dubai, which are also keen to dominate the crypto market. However, some industry leaders criticize Hong Kong\u2019s regulatory framework as too restrictive. They argue that it could hinder global investor participation and limit market expansion. For example, Livio Weng, CEO of HashKey Exchange, has voiced concerns that the new regulations might impede the influx of global users. He fears that the restrictive policies could stifle the market\u2019s potential growth in Hong Kong. This issue is exacerbated by the limited number of available licenses, which has made them highly prized yet controversial. \u201cSo this blocks a lot of global users from coming to Hong Kong,\u201d Weng said.

It has taken the crypto market by storm and has become the hottest crypto of the week. A reason for the fast-growing attention is that BEFE coin enjoys unique features that make it exceptional compared to other meme coins, and this has kept it on the radar of investors globally. BEFE has outperformed many meme coins, even the ones with bigger popularity, because it is embedded with utilities, making it a project that gives value, unlike others waiting for a pleasant market condition. BEFE Coin, Not Your Regular Meme Coin Meme coins are characterized by using memes to gain traction in the cryptocurrency sector. Most meme coins rely on hype as utilities are not the priority, making them a bad option for long-term investments. Many investors habitually seek meme coins that can give them the profit they seek temporarily while reinvesting in some other coins that could serve as good long-term options. BEFE is rewriting the narrative as it brings excitement and utility, making investors yearn for the project offerings while maintaining the hype around it. This approach by BEFE is superb as it encourages sustainability. It breaks BEFE free from being controlled by general market conditions to being controlled by investors\u2019 interest in offerings. This is the primary reason BEFE stands out from others. It can potentially give mouthwatering returns at every market phase as demand regularly increases. Strategic Partnerships Pushing BEFE To The Limelight The height BEFE attained results from the kind of partnership it has engaged in. Partnerships are very instrumental factors for growth. With the right partnership, all parties benefit massively, and growth is ensured. BEFE\u2019s partnership with Bitgert is a perfect example of a symbiotic partnership where all parties benefit. Investors can get to stake and earn in return, thereby encouraging an expansion of the ecosystem for both parties. This partnership has increased demand as investors seek to make passive income easily; via this increasing demand, popularity follows suit.

It is exploding onto the scene as a favorite with the highest and cutting-edge solutions. Now, let\u2019s look at what makes Bitgert stand out. The Bitgert Ecosystem Bitgert is an outstanding crypto initiative aspiring to bring radical changes into the blockchain space with a wide spectrum of products and audit solutions. In less than 200 days since launch, the project launched its own Blockchain, BRISE Wallet, Audits, Swap, Staking, and the Bitgert Exchange service, which confirms a rapid pace of development in the ecosystem. This project has many appealing investment side deals: staking rewards paid in BUSD and a strategically devised buyback plan to improve the value and rareness of the token. Bitgert currently trades at a market capitalization of $77,690,191, with a fully diluted valuation of $83,850,485, noting that they have a lively 24-hour trading volume of $2,219,396. Bitgert hit an all-time high of $0.0000051842 on March 7, 2022, which is 89.3% over the current value. Its all-time low price was at $0.0000000096166 on September 9, 2021, way higher by 31,797.12% now, evidently showing how the project moved from the price most importantly in its development. Bitgert had declined by 8.50% in price over the past week. However, with all this innovation and their ability to deploy blockchain products so fast, Bitgert remains one of the projects with quite good potential in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Major Advantages Posed by BRISE Below are some of the benefits that Bitgert (BRISE) would bring to the crypto market, thus making it an outstanding option for consideration: Bitgert introduced BRC20 blockchain, remarkable for making its users pay almost no gas fees, literally 0.0000000000001 dollars for the whole transaction. This innovation would place Bitgert as one of the lowest-cost options to place, further reducing the barrier that costs represent in transactions within the blockchain. The throughput capacity for the BRC20 blockchain is up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). This, therefore, brings a very high transaction speed that is efficient even in cross-chain transactions. This kind of speed is good enough to make sure that users\u2019 experiences are not undermined, like waiting for too long to process a given transaction, even during peak times. The Bitgert ecosystem duly covers DeFi, NFT, Web 3.0, and Metaverse, putting the project to its place as a one-stop-shop service for all your needs in many different blockchain technologies. Bitgert token is engineered with a buy-back mechanism specific for reserving 5% of every transaction fee to acquire tokens and support token price, thus making it a deflationary asset. Besides, the staking benefits the investor with a total tax commission of 12% on the network, encouraging holding for the long term and attracting investment on the platform. End Call Bitgert is the best crypto right now, which you can buy in/hold if you believe in the ecosystem\u2019s future sustainability. The entire ecosystem is utility-driven, probing investors with optimistic return potentials for the future. Regardless, individual research and risk appetite knowledge are always mandatory before final buy-in.

This is after news that Hong Kong is likely to approve its first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as soon as early next week. Bitbot (BITBOT) is nearing the $2.3 million mark in presale amid investor interest. Bitcoin is trading up, currently green as price hovers above $70,900. The leading cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to break out to a new all-time high has received a new boost as reports emerge Hong Kong is set to approve its first spot Bitcoin ETFs. BTC\u2019s upside flip is likely to push other altcoins higher, and one of the new tokens attracting the most attention is Bitbot (BITBOT). Is Bitcoin (BTC) set to explode next week? There are reports that Hong Kong could approve the first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the region as early as Monday. A Bloomberg report on Friday quotes sources as saying that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is set to give it nod, just days after major Chinese funds applied to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs. While Hong Kong\u2019s decision is not officially communicated as of writing, there\u2019s growing positivity in the market already. In January 2024, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, the price of BTC skyrocketed amid massive demand. BTC reached its ATH of $73,737 in March, riding halving and spot ETFs sentiment. The SEC has called for public participation on spot ETH ETFs. Today\u2019s news has seen the bellwether crypto flip from lows of $69,500 to currently trade above $70,900. Ethereum has also gained slightly, currently hovering above $3,520. Should the ETFs draw inflows as witnessed with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and others, there\u2019s potential for BTC, ETH and other coins to rally in coming weeks. Also likely to attract investor are new tokens that could tap into the overall market strength and specific fundamentals to emerge as top performers in the market in 2024 and beyond. Bitbot: Pioneering non-custodial trading bot on Telegram BitBot is the pioneering non-custodial crypto trading bot, poised to enter the crypto market at a time traders are keen on available opportunities. While competing Telegram trading bots are custodial solutions \u2013 that is they control users\u2019 private keys and thus hold their assets \u2013 Bitbot takes the approach of \u2018not your keys, not your assets.\u201d In short, Bitbot is where a Telegram bot user has the full control of their private keys and wallet. Security is key to crypto traders, who unfortunately have had to learn the hard way given incidents involving top bots such as Unibot and Banana Gun. By focusing on security through its partnership with Knightsafe, Bitbot has taken an early lead against potential rival trading apps. Bitbot app\u2019s AI capabilities add to the superior outlook, with users able to access all the advanced institutional-grade trading tools that make trading via bots such a huge market in the crypto space. Bitbot offers all of these, including trade sniping, gem scanner, copy trading and automated execution, without compromising on user security and convenience. Bitbot presale surpasses $2.2 million amid investor interest The native BITBOT token is in presale and users will get access to benefits such as revenue-sharing, trading discounts and airdrops. Presale participants can buy BITBOT at the still heavily discounted price of $0.0155 in stage 10. Early bird investors have pushed the presale to near $2.3 million. Notably, there\u2019s just five stages to go before Bitbot hits the final stage 15 and tokens debut in the market. This could be at a time when Bitcoin and Ethereum are in parabolic mode. That means current presale prices could be a real bargain and opportunity. To learn more visit the Bitbot website.

This rendition is just as good as promised and fans cannot get enough of the series. People were of course intrigued when Nolan and Joy started the show because the depiction of the universe and the lead roles by Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, and Walton Goggins were of high quality. However, amidst the excitement, some die-hard fans have raised concerns about potential discrepancies with established canon, particularly regarding the acclaimed game Fallout: The New Vegas. A near-perfect premiere season Revealing all seasons at once will help the audience to experience it as a real one and fill themselves up. On a day named Bombs Drop Day in the year 2296, 135 years after the events that took place in Fallout by Interplay Systems, the plot begins. While hailed as a near-perfect premiere season, some fans have noted apparent inconsistencies with established lore, particularly regarding Fallout: Newbeautiful. Accusations of Retconning Fallout: Fallout: New Vegas, which was created by Obsidian Entertainment and launched in 2010, is said to be the best of the entire Fallout series by fans. So does the reason of the fans\u2019 displeasure result from the suspicion that the live-action series follows the erasing or retconning of events from New Vegas. The series differs from New Vegas encompassing a character like Goggins yet the presentation of the government led by New California Republic is totally different from what we have in New Vegas. In *Fallout: On the one hand, in the game, there is a very powerful NCR but in the series, instead, there are only a few members that used to be part of their former grandeur. Confusion and criticism The attempts to reconcile these differences made by Bethesda Design Director Emil Pagliarulo like the posting of the official timeline instead make the matter much worse and result in new inflammatory remarks and negative talk. Some fans question the canonicity of the series, while others express frustration over what they perceive as disrespect towards Fallout: New No-Man\u2019s-Land. The protagonist of the argument said, \u201cBethesda has no clue about what the movie\u2019s setting and mood need to be at all\u201d. Instead, they rolled out this narrative, \u201cYup, we agree.\u201d The most severe comment, \u201cIt seems like it was Todd junior writing it,\u201d was also made by someone, hinting to fault the shoemaker\u2019s bias to Bethesda. New Vegas sneak press a run in Season 2 cloak. Despite a loss under the critical conditions Vegas\u2019 remains stand for the second season. Although the center of the city stays a riddle, the exchange of this familiarity icon leads to a mixture of eager and doubtful feeling in audience. New Vegas\u2019s exploration in Season 2 gives hope to those who are disenchanted about deviations, and there is something to keep looking forward to. This, however, would ensure that the show is faithful to the canon and has the audience it is the most suitable with, but, still, this would require an additional, careful consideration of the source material and the expectations of the fans. Franchise richness in the universe of Canon inspire several intercourse in Canon. As the Fallout universe is spreading across different medias, it becomes easier and easier to add contradictory elements and make the fans confused. While the live-action adaptation has breathed new life into the franchise, it must tread carefully to honor the legacy of beloved games like Fallout: Vegas New. The Season 2 with more diverse story-telling styles and the novel idea of coming back to those pivotally important places brings to the fans such hope. They are filled with eager excitement. No one is certain how the series will unite these stories and snatch nay-sayers\u2019 popcorns away. While the fans stalk for the hints of a disordered downfall of Fallout, they stay focused and they watch carefully.","article_summary":"This Spring, Amazon begins the Fallout series with a thrilling movie adaptation of a popular post-apocalyptic story.

This amount was confiscated by the U.K. government in response to a money laundering attempt that failed. Those who have been wronged, through a pressure group have approached China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They look for help in haggling with the U.K. to get back the confiscated cryptocurrency. Their request highlights the need of proving lawful possession in order to enable the funds to be returned. The defrauded funds had originated from $6.2 billion investment scam by Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology. Lasting from 2014 to 2017, this fraud deceived thousands. Almost 2,500 signatures have been collected for the victim group of people. These are to be forwarded to both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Public Security in China. Bitcoin seizure triggers major UK investigation The UK\u2019s participation was initiated by Jian Wen, a previous hospitality worker who tried to acquire over-the-top real estate using Bitcoin. Since Wen could not reveal the origin of these funds, questions were raised, and an official inquiry was initiated. Also, in 2021, a search performed on a residence rented by Wen and her employer, Zhimin Qian uncovered 61,000 BTC. The value of these at the time of seizure was about $1.7 billion. The value of the cryptocurrency that was seized has since gone up, currently approximated at $4.3 billion. Wen first argued that Bitcoin was a mining product. Subsequently, she changed her version, claiming it was a present from Qian, who has subsequently disappeared from the UK. Wen was accused of money laundering, and she was convicted by Southwark Crown Court on March 20. Fraud victims fear loss of Bitcoin funds Legal and some diplomatic obstacles make the process of recovery itself a difficult assignment. The U.K. government has yet to declare the way it is going to deal with the confiscated Bitcoin. The uncertainty has only made the fears of the fraud victims worse because they are wondering whether they are ever going to recover their losses. In their letter to the Chinese government, the group states their strong rejection of the permanent confiscation of their funds by the U.K. In the meantime, Jian Wen was charged with money laundering in U.K., and he was found guilty on March 20 by the Southwark Crown Court. At first, Wen contended she had mined the Bitcoin. Still, later she called it a present from Qian, who has since absconded from the U.K. Wen\u2019s conviction represents a significant development in this matter, which may affect the ongoing attempts to repatriate the confiscation funds to the rightful owners.","article_summary":"Victims of a large investment fraud in China are calling on their government to recover $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Due to the recent momentum, crypto enthusiasts are becoming less pessimistic about the digital asset\u2019s growth prior to the halving event. With the fast approaching much-anticipated Bitcoin Halving, Rekt Capital, a well-recognized cryptocurrency analyst and aficionado, has offered his market insights mapping out three distinct stages of the event for investors. 3 Distinct Aspects Of The Bitcoin Halving Rekt Capital\u2019s analysis delves into Bitcoin\u2018s movement before and after the halving takes place, which is expected to happen this month. In the seven days leading up to the occurrence, the crypto analyst underscored three stages to observe for a successful outcome. These three phases include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation phase, and the parabolic uptrend phase. Emphasizing on the first aspect, Rekt Capital noted that the pre-halving retrace is documented in the books and has already manifested. During this period, Bitcoin experienced an 18% pullback compared to 2016 and 2020\u2019s retracement of 38% and 19%, respectively. The expert believes that the concluded pre-halving Retrace was the last chance to purchase a deal during the pre-halving phase. Following the conclusion of the retrace, Rekt Capital has confirmed the development has laid the groundwork for the Re-accumulation range. It is important to note that the aforementioned range occurs a few weeks ahead of the halving, and it ends with a breakout from it a few weeks later. Specifically, the period could last for several weeks and up to 150 days or five months. Given the manifestation of the range, sideways movement through the halving and beyond is the major purpose of BTC.

Due to the recent momentum, crypto enthusiasts are becoming less pessimistic about the digital asset\u2019s growth prior to the halving event. With the fast approaching much-anticipated Bitcoin Halving, Rekt Capital, a well-recognized cryptocurrency analyst and aficionado, has offered his market insights mapping out three distinct stages of the event for investors. 3 Distinct Aspects Of The Bitcoin Halving Rekt Capital\u2019s analysis delves into Bitcoin\u2018s movement before and after the halving takes place, which is expected to happen this month. In the seven days leading up to the occurrence, the crypto analyst underscored three stages to observe for a successful outcome. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is \u201cProgrammed\u201d With Halving Approaching: Analyst These three phases include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation phase, and the parabolic uptrend phase. Emphasizing on the first aspect, Rekt Capital noted that the pre-halving retrace is documented in the books and has already manifested. During this period, Bitcoin experienced an 18% pullback compared to 2016 and 2020\u2019s retracement of 38% and 19%, respectively. The expert believes that the concluded pre-halving Retrace was the last chance to purchase a deal during the pre-halving phase. Following the conclusion of the retrace, Rekt Capital has confirmed the development has laid the groundwork for the Re-accumulation range. It is important to note that the aforementioned range occurs a few weeks ahead of the halving, and it ends with a breakout from it a few weeks later. Specifically, the period could last for several weeks and up to 150 days or five months. Given the manifestation of the range, sideways movement through the halving and beyond is the major purpose of BTC. Thus, the analyst has stressed the need to be patient around this phase, as many investors get frustrated, bored, and disappointed here because their Bitcoin investments lack significant returns. As a result, they lose confidence and get shaken out of the market before the event. BTC\u2019s Post-Halving Rally Might Mirror Previous Trend As for the parabolic uptrend, Rekt Capital claims the phase will begin when Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation range. He further stated that the price of BTC tends to grow more quickly and enters a parabolic upsurge during this stage.

This move positions Hong Kong as a pivotal player in the Asian cryptocurrency market and underscores its ambition to become a leading digital-asset hub. Approval For The Spot Bitcoin, ETH ETFs On Monday? The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong is reportedly finalizing the approval process, with Harvest Global Investments and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital poised to receive the first set of approvals. These approvals are contingent upon completing the necessary listing arrangements with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (HKEX), aiming for a product launch by the end of April. Unlike the futures-based crypto ETFs currently available in Hong Kong, these spot-crypto ETFs will allow for direct investment in the actual cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether. This method could offer a more tangible asset base for investors, contrasting with derivatives-based investments. The introduction of similar ETFs in the United States on January 11 this year has been linked to increased market activity and significant capital inflows into the sector. Notably, the upcoming Hong Kong ETFs will utilize an \u201cin-kind creation model,\u201d as reported earlier by Bitcoinist. This model facilitates the actual exchange of cryptocurrencies in the creation and redemption processes, which could reduce costs and improve liquidity\u2014a notable advancement over traditional ETF structures and the US peers. Moreover, the rollout of these ETFs is strategically timed, as the global crypto community anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event in just eight days, which historically influenced market dynamics. This strategic launch could attract substantial new investments not only by Hong Kongers but also from the wider Chinese and Asian market. This development follows a series of regulatory advancements in Hong Kong, including the implementation of a regulatory regime for virtual asset service providers and the approval of virtual asset management funds. The introduction of these spot ETFs is seen as a continuation of these efforts to foster a regulated and stable environment for digital assets, enhancing investor protection and integrating digital assets more closely with traditional financial sectors. According to Singapore-based Matrixport, the investment vehicle could unlock up to $25 billion in demand from Chinese investors through the Southbound Stock Connect program. At press time, BTC price did not show any major reaction to the news and traded at $70,656.","article_summary":"Hong Kong is on the cusp of approving its first spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with potential final approvals as early as Monday, according to Bloomberg, citing two people familiar with the matter.

This is according to ARK Invest\u2019s latest report, \u201cThe Bitcoin Monthly,\u201d covering the events of March 2024. BTC\u2019s price reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 in March, marking an approximately 18.5% gain from the start of the month. The price level also represents a nearly 75% surge during Q1 2024. However, after achieving this ATH, BTC entered a period of consolidation. Bitcoin Market Remains Bullish Despite Profit-Taking ARK Invest\u2019s analysis highlights that the market sentiment remains robust despite significant profit-taking by long-term holders. This trend is underscored by a steadfast group of investors who have held their positions for five years or more. Their commitment underpins stability in the face of profit-taking. One of the core indicators, MVRV Z-Score, suggests that Bitcoin has not yet entered the excessively exuberant zone often seen in past cycle peaks. Read more: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030 Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score is an indicator that measures the market value against the realized value. While technically overbought according to certain indicators, the MVRV Z-score suggests Bitcoin\u2019s relative valuation remains below the levels indicative of unsustainable market froth. Bitcoin\u2019s Health Based on Several Key Metrics. Source: ARK Invest Regarding technical support levels, Bitcoin\u2019s price exceeds several key metrics, including the short-term holder cost basis and the 200-day moving average. This suggests a resilient market price; however, significant sell-offs can trigger price corrections. March also saw a notable balance in the inflow and outflow of funds in the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with assets under management climbing to over $59 billion. This shows continued interest and investment in Bitcoin, reinforcing its appeal to retail and institutional investors. \u201cIn March, US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows hit records that nearly balanced at $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively,\u201d ARK Invest wrote. Further buoying the positive outlook is the improvement in Bitcoin\u2019s risk-adjusted returns. ARK notes that Bitcoin\u2019s four-year annualized returns and the Sharpe ratio have reached three-year highs. This momentum upswing follows a period of lower volatility and less dramatic price action throughout 2022 and 2023. On the innovation front, Bitcoin\u2019s scaling solutions are seeing rapid advancements. More than 50 independent projects are developing on the Bitcoin base layer, employing technologies such as Roll-ups, State Channels, and Sidechains. Significant contributions from initiatives like the Lightning Network, Rootstock, and Stacks have collectively locked in nearly $700 million in value since October 2023. However, it\u2019s important to remember that the outlook presented by ARK Invest here only summarizes Bitcoin\u2019s performance in March 2024.

The price of AXS asset has been displaying bearish behavior and has been declining consistently on the daily chart, indicating a potential further downward trend. The asset\u2019s performance was poor last week and last month, with a drop of -3.59% and -25.95%, respectively, which suggests a stable downtrend. The price of Axie Infinity crypto has significantly dropped in recent times. This decline was evident as the price plunged from a crucial level of approximately $13.50 on the chart. AXS crypto is deteriorating at faster pace, as it meets the resistance level and could dive to new lows from the current price. The Axie Infinity price asset plunged below the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. Likewise, the AXS price asset is displaying bearish characteristics as MACD is below the zero line at -0.73 and the RSI is falling smoothly below the median line at 41.60, implying that the Axie Infinity asset is losing momentum and can achieve new depths in the coming sessions. At press time, the AXS crypto had experienced a 1.99% decline in the last 24 hours to $9.36. Therefore, if the Axie Infinity price fails to stay above the $8.50 level, it could decline further and reach lower lows. However, if the demand for the crypto remains high, the AXS asset price could bounce back from the current level by surpassing the below trendline. The next goal for Axie Infinity is to reach $11.0 and $12.0. AXS Volume Analysis Upon examining the AXS chart, it becomes evident that there was a surge in trading volume on or around March 10th, 2024. This increase in volume suggests that there was a notable uptick in both interest and market activity regarding the Axie Infinity token at that particular moment in time. It is worth noting that the volume had previously surpassed the $600 Million mark. However, from March 11th, 2024 onwards, volume continued to fall, and a significant descent in AXS activity was observed which illustrated decreased demand and excitement about Axie Infinity price. The trading volume depleted from $600 Million to the low of $250 Million by April 8th on the chart. AXS Crypto Active Addresses Declining The count of active addresses in the AXS refers to the number of unique addresses of Axie Infinity users who have participated in one or more transactions within a specific timeframe. Within the last hour, there were 31 transactions, in the past 24 hours, the number of transactions involving different addresses in Axie Infinity was 357, in the past 7 days were 1529, and in the last 30 days, there were 6907 transactions involving unique addresses in the AXS asset. This data indicates that the number of people who are involved in using and trading the AXS is decreasing. As a result, the demand and value for the Axie Infinity price may also be decreasing due to the decreasing number of active addresses over time. These terms are used to highlight the short-term and long-term trends of AXS crypto\u2019s activity and its adoption. Summary The AXS asset price is falling, showing bearish signs on the daily chart. Last week and last month saw poor performances with drops of 3.59% and 25.95%, indicating a stable downtrend. From March 11th, 2024, AXS volume fell significantly, indicating decreased demand for Axie Infinity. Trading volume dropped from $600 Million to $250 Million by April 8th.

NASA and SpaceX astronauts are utilizing the metaverse to undergo training, for life on a space station known as \u201cGateway,\u201d which is currently in the works. This space station is envisioned as a cutting-edge science laboratory solar-powered spacecraft and a home away from home for astronauts from around the world as detailed in a blog post by NASA. How Metaverse Is Changing The Cosmo Game In the past astronauts typically trained for missions using computer-based simulators. However with the advent of virtual reality headsets and advanced spatial computing technologies astronauts now have the opportunity to acquire the skills to operate and thrive in an immersive 3D environment. The initial inhabitants of space will be the team for managing Gateway, which is being established as a crucial site for the Artemis program. The goal of this U.S.-led endeavor is to construct a manned outpost on the Moon. This will be part of humanity\u2019s mission to send a human to Mars. Gateway plays a role in the Artemis missions According to NASA Gateway plays a role in the Artemis missions. Will serve as a versatile outpost orbiting the Moon. It will offer support for surface expeditions serve as a hub for scientific endeavors and acts as a launching point for further exploration, into deep space. As per NASA, the astronauts assigned to the Gateway project will encounter the mission of becoming the crew of an orbital space station in deep space situated at a distance of around 386,243 kilometers from Earth. In contrast, astronauts aboard the International Space Station typically work at a distance of 400 kilometers, from Earth. NASA Planning to Utilize Blockchain Technology NASA is teaming up with Lonestar and the Isle of Man to use blockchain technology for verifying and securing data storage on the moon during the upcoming Artemis missions. Blockchain will be used to provide irrefutable proof of human landing on the moon during NASA\u2019s Artemis 3 mission in 2025. Before that, Artemis 2 will launch in November 2024 with a crewed mission to orbit the moon and return to Earth. As one of the scientific missions during the Artemis voyages, Lonestar and the Isle of Man will develop lunar storage systems that rely on solar power and require no additional infrastructure. According to Roosen, the head of innovation at Digital Isle of Man, the island\u2019s government-funded agency that supports its tech sector, \u201cpeople often tell NASA: \u2018You made up the moon missions,\u2019 and proving that they\u2019re actually there is surprisingly difficult.\u201d How Blockchain Is Useful To NASA? Blockchain technology\u2019s immutability is reliable for recording and verifying future lunar missions. This would provide real-time check-in mechanisms for lunar exploration and indisputable evidence of human presence on the moon\u2019s surface, helping NASA dispel any conspiracy theories surrounding lunar landings. This project marks a significant milestone in the evolving relationship between blockchain technology and space exploration, as blockchain-verified data storage solutions could authenticate historical space achievements and future lunar activities as NASA\u2019s Artemis program progresses.

The issues related to security & scalability have persisted in the blockchain technology since its launch and require an effective solution. Chainlink (LINK), a decentralized blockchain oracle network streaming on Ethereum, introduced a new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019 for safer data transfer. The Bridge app is available on a few of the blockchains including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, etc. Chainlink\u2019s New Bridge App Details On Thursday, April 11, to mitigate the challenge of security, Chainlink introduced a new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019 for safer data and value transfer. The new application will permit users to transfer the tokens and data across different blockchains without any security concerns and is available for individuals and institutions. The aim is to offer the best and most cost-effective way to make high-value token transfers effortless and secure. The new bridge was developed on Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) technology, which is mainly used by SWIFT for shifting large token volumes and messages to other networks in a safe way. Additionally, the technology is used by banks for international money transfers. Apart from top-notch security, the platform also supports real-time visual tracking to check the status of transfers between blockchains. The platform charges the regular fee for using the technology and includes the cost of executing the transaction on different blockchains and fees paid to CCIP service providers. The Transporter application is currently available for blockchains including Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and WEMIX. Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of Chainlink addressed the new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019. \u201cHaving a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years,\u201d, Nazarov added. Bridges play a crucial role in interconnecting the individual blockchain rails, permitting the transaction of value and data in between. According to DefiLlama data, the existing bridges have transferred around across different chains last month. However, all these bridges are the targets of exploits and hacks, holding chances of user data loss. Chainlink\u2019s Upcoming Events Chainlink is a platform connecting the world of blockchains and is actively engaged in innovations and inventions. After the launch of \u2018Transporter,\u2019 the platform is ready to work on its upcoming projects like Chainlink SmartCon and Introducing the Chainlink Block Magic Hackathon. Chainlink SmartCon is an event going to be organized in Hong Kong between October 30 and 31, 2024. The event involves digital asset leaders, DeFi pioneers, and on-chain builders who will come together to discuss technological topics and invent the future of global markets. Another upcoming event on Chainlink is Block Magic, which is going to be organized from April to June and involves different events like Chainlink Bootcamp, workshops, Hackathon kick-off, and Project submission deadline. According to CoinMarketCap data, Chainlink is currently trading at $17.44 after an upsurge of 0.64% in the past 1 day and has a market cap of $10,236,002,394. The coin has a 24-volume of $277,908,962, a maximum supply of 1 Million, and a circulating supply of 587,099,970.","article_summary":"Chainlink, a platform connecting public and private blockchains has launched a new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019 for making data and value transactions safer.

Grayscale Investment is one of the organizations that got approval for the spot Bitcoin ETF. On Wednesday, GBTC hit its new all-time low, helping the fund category end a two-day net outflow streak. $17.5 Million of net money was withdrawn from the funds, as per the Farside Investors data. GBTC Hit Its All-Time Low A report from Farside Investors recorded the assets leaving GBTC hit a new single-day low in funds. Grayscale Investment\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF experienced a historic low in asset withdrawal, contributing to the end of a two-day trend of net withdrawals across the wider fund category. On Wednesday, GBTC recorded a net departure of $17.5 Million, the lowest to date, as reported by Farside Investors, marking a significant decrease from the $303 Million and $155 Million net outflows on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Source: Farside report The reduced outflow from GBTC aided the US spot bitcoin ETF sector, consisting of 11 funds, in achieving net inflows totaling $124 Million. Additionally, the BTC funds faced net outflows of $224 Million and $19 Million on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Since Bitcoin\u2019s transformation to an ETF on January 11, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin offering has consistently reported net outflows every trading day, with the most significant outflow hitting $642 Million on March 18. The ongoing loss of assets from the trust can be due to GBTC\u2019s 1.5% fee, which is notably higher than that of the nine other spot bitcoin ETFs. The net outflows from GBTC on Wednesday, amounting to $17.5 Million, were lower than the prior record of $22 Million on February 26. Sumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, in an interview with Blockworks, expressed that the initial wave of sales by arbitrage traders and those shifting to more affordable funds was mostly concluded. However, GBTC\u2019s outflows hiked in successive days, hitting $600 Million on February 29. Roy cautioned Blockworks that it\u2019s early to declare the end of GBTC\u2019s outflows. He suggested that a pattern of minor outflows, or even inflows, over several days would be necessary before making such a determination. A few of the analysts consider bankruptcy lender Genesis as the major player behind the continued outflows from GBTC. Genesis liquidating its holdings in the fund and estimates valued Genesis\u2019s investment in the Grayscale fund at approximately $1.6 billion. However, as per court documents, Genesis and its associated commodities had completely liquidated their nearly 36 million GBTC shares by April 2, using the proceeds to purchase 32,041 Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin\u2019s Performance To Date According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC is currently trading at $70,640.85, after a surge of 0.05% in the last day with a market cap of $1,390,240,213,879.

Major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and many more have maintained a sluggish trend. As the bears take hold of the market, the newly launched tokens show potential for growth and massive returns. Fantom, Ethena, and DTX Exchange have proved their growth potential by exhibiting a green candle for over a month. The upward trajectory of these tokens has raised the question of the best token for massive gains. Analysts Predict Ethena\u2019s Price Surge Ethereum\u2019s synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena, has amassed a market capitalization of more than $2 Billion and may quickly establish itself in the top 50. Given that the price of the ENA is following a sharp upward trend, the short-term trade is very bullish. The token consistently makes higher highs and lows, anticipating a small decline. Analysts predict it will make another higher low and then form the next ATH, which will be around $1.66. The OBV is still trending upward, and the RSI is still bullish. Thus, it implies that there is sufficient room to grow, given the liquidity on the platforms. Moreover, rising whale activity and staking rewards make room for price surges shortly. Whale-Driven Momentum Builds For Fantom Fantom (FTM) is on the cusp of a market upswing as it approaches the pivotal $1 threshold. Significant whale activity supports this possible surge, and noteworthy buying patterns point to a bullish outlook. Investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are keeping a close eye on these developments, which may portend an impending price breakthrough for FTM. Addresses with significant FTM holdings, ranging from 100,000 to 10 million tokens, have added more than 19 million FTM, or almost $19 Million, to their combined holdings last week. Whales\u2019 aggressive accumulation is a warning sign that could move the market and raise the price of FTM. The RSI indicator positions FTM in a potential bullish phase, with room for growth if the trend continues. Currently trading at $0.98, FTM is flirting with the crucial $1.00 mark. However, the DTX Exchange\u2019s growth potential remains unparalleled proving it to be the best choice of investment. DTX Exchange (DTX) Is The Best Choice For Massive Gains In 2024 Making waves in the DeFi space, DTX Exchange (DTX) employs a hybrid strategy that blends elements of decentralized and centralized exchanges. With its state-of-the-art setup and wide range of trading options, the platform provides traders with unmatched market opportunities. The platform will offer users 1000X leverage without requiring KYC verification, making it the first large-scale exchange to do so. Distributed liquidity pools are also used to minimize slippage. Additionally, it benefits traders with low trading fees and the ability to participate in governance votes and proposals. DTX Exchange\u2019s non-custodial wallet strategy provides security and decentralization. In the event of a security breach, traders\u2019 complete control over their private keys and digital assets is preserved. This dedication to personal accountability and ownership fits in perfectly with the project\u2019s philosophy. The ongoing presale presents marks a prime time for investors to be a part of DTX Exchange and play an integral role in shaping its future. With the total volume of decentralized exchanges reaching around $447 Trillion in the past 24 hours, DTX is poised to capitalize on this market opportunity, especially given its presale price of $0.02.

This demonstrated the potential of asset tokenization, an expanding industry that seeks to integrate conventional financial products with blockchain technology. Investors and enthusiasts explore blockchain\u2019s potential to transform financial markets as traditional finance and DeFi mix. The Increase In Asset Tokenization Using blockchain technology, asset tokenization represents trades and manages traditional assets like equities and real estate. This is transforming the banking industry. Digital tokens are made on a blockchain network as verifiable asset ownership records. This process offers increased liquidity by making assets more tradable on decentralized platforms. It also improves transparency, providing an auditable record of ownership and transactions. These benefits reduce the risk of fraud and manipulation in financial markets. Ondo Finance\u2019s Trailblazing Experiment And The Implications Ondo Finance\u2019s successful test of instant conversion between Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin and BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL token sets a groundbreaking precedent for asset tokenization. By exchanging $250,000 worth of BUIDL tokens for USDC, Ondo Finance demonstrated the practicality of this innovative technology. CEO Nathan Allman stated that the experiment aimed to enable instant redemptions of Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG) tokens into USDC. This seamless conversion showcases how asset tokenization can streamline redemption processes and enhance liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. This experiment\u2019s implications go beyond DeFi. For established financial organizations, asset tokenization can open up new pathways for efficiency, accessibility, and liquidity. Tokenized assets have the potential to expedite settlement times, lower risks, and increase investor access to premium asset classes. BlackRock\u2019s Entry & The Convergence Of Traditional Finance & DeFi BlackRock, a major financial institution, recently entered the asset tokenization race by launching the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with Securitize. This fund holds the Ethereum-based BUIDL token, which represents traditional assets like cash and US Treasury bills. BlackRock\u2019s action indicates that it is embracing blockchain technology in the financial industry. When BlackRock entered asset tokenization, it was a turning point in integrating DeFi and traditional finance. Growing interest in blockchain among major financial institutions promotes increased cooperation between the two industries. This confluence can change the financial landscape and promote innovation by combining the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology with compliance with and knowledge of traditional banking. The Future Of Asset Tokenization & The ONDO Token Rally As news spread of Ondo Finance\u2019s successful transaction, the ONDO token surged by 8%, reflecting growing interest in asset tokenization. This technology aims to bring traditional financial assets onto blockchain platforms, offering transparency and accessibility. Several factors drove the spike in ONDO\u2019s price. First, it showcased Ondo Finance\u2019s tech prowess and leadership in DeFi innovation. Second, it highlighted the practical benefits of asset tokenization, opening new revenue avenues for the platform. And third, it bolstered investor confidence in Ondo\u2019s future growth prospects. Looking ahead, asset tokenization holds promise as traditional finance embraces blockchain. This could lead to new financial products and market efficiencies. However, collaboration is needed to address regulatory and technical challenges for sustainable growth. Conclusion Ondo Finance\u2019s test with instant conversion between USDC and BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL token marks a big step in asset tokenization\u2019s evolution. The 8% ONDO token rally shows excitement for this sector, set to change how traditional financial assets are traded and managed. With big players like BlackRock\u2019s involvement, blockchain\u2019s integration into finance gains momentum. This convergence offers innovation, efficiency, and broader access to financial markets. However, there are still issues with compatibility, scalability, and regulation. Working together, stakeholders can overcome these obstacles and guarantee sustainable progress. Still, Ondo Finance\u2019s success highlights asset tokenization\u2019s disruptive potential. As traditional and decentralized finance merge, we anticipate a more inclusive, transparent, and efficient financial world.","article_summary":"Excitation erupted in the DeFi community after Ondo Finance\u2019s governance token, ONDO, spiked 8% due to the platform\u2019s successful test of instantaneous conversion between BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL token and Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin.

John Deaton\u2019s Campaign Fundraising As reported by Eleanor Terret of Fox Business, the lawyer-turned-senate hopeful raised $1.36 million for his campaign Q1, compared to Warren\u2019s $1.1 million. \u201cAccording to his campaign, Deaton has received donations from prominent figures in the crypto industry such as Ripple execs Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Charles Hoskinson, Jameson Lopp, and Anthony Scaramucci,\u201d Terret wrote to X on Friday. According to Politico, donors including Garlinghouse, Larsen, Scaramucci, and the Winklevoss twins put down the maximum donations of $6600 for his campaign. NEW: According to the Federal Election Commission, @DeatonforSenate outraised @SenWarren in the first quarter with Deaton raising total revenues of $1.36M and Warren $1.1M. According to his campaign, Deaton has received donations from prominent figures in the #crypto industry\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 12, 2024 Deaton\u2019s large, largely corporate funding is as foretold by Warren, who issued warnings to her followers in February in anticipation of Deaton\u2019s campaign announcement. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, but this now means we need to prepare to compete against funding from powerful special interests, Wall Street, and the GOP,\u201d she said at the time. Deaton\u2019s history with the crypto industry is no secret. He\u2019s best known for representing 75,000 XRP holders in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that closed last year, which mostly panned out in Ripple\u2019s favor. He\u2019s also blasted the SEC for harshly treating the crypto industry in several other high-profile lawsuits, including its fight with Grayscale \u2013 the issuer of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF. The result of that lawsuit ultimately forced the SEC into allowing Bitcoin spot ETFs to trade, which Elizabeth Warren loudly disapproved of. Is Elizabeth Warren Worried? Beyond crypto, Warren and Deaton fiercely disagree on other partisan topics: student loan forgiveness, the migrant crisis, and loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. \u201cI\u2019ve beaten the odds as an underdog my entire life and I\u2019m going to do it again.

Bitcoin was a relative safe haven versus most of the market, dropping just 4.5% to $67,000. That leaves it still only about 9% down from its recent record highs near $74,000. With Bitcoin increasingly viewed as a form of digital gold, it could even rally if Iran/Israel/US tensions rise further. But with the halving around the corner and Fed rate cut bets fading, investors may remain reluctant to pile in. They may instead be eyeing up opportunities in the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain shitcoin markets. On-chain markets refer to the market for tokens that are issued directly onto blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. The name \u201cshitcoin\u201d refer to the fact that most of these tokens are scams, pump-and-dumps, or lacking in real utility. But on-chain shitcoin markets are also one of the only places where traders are able to secure gains of 10x or more in under 24 hours. Here are the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be watching, as per DEXTools. As a reminder, potential investors should always do their own research into tokens and never risk more than they can afford to lose. Top Crypto Gainers Today 42 times 10 (420) A just-launched meme coin called 42 times 10 (420) is up 1,750% on Friday, as per DEXTools. Despite these big gains, the token\u2019s market cap was last around $150,000, with only around $40,000 in liquidity. The token also still has less than 100 holders and only saw $28,000 in trading volumes over the past 24 hours. As per DEXTools\u2019 smart contract audit, the token has three concerning aspects to its smart contract. Traders should be very careful with this highly illiquid shitcoin. WojakPepe (WOPE) A new hybrid version of the Pepe and Wojak meme coins called WojakPepe (WOPE) is up 550% on Friday. That\u2019s as per DEXTools, who puts the token\u2019s market cap at $1 million and liquidity at $100,000. The token last had just over 550 holders and 24 hour trading volumes of $6,2 million. Not bad for a first day of trade. That being said, the token has two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools. The utility of the token also isn\u2019t clear. So traders should be very cautious with this shitcoin. pepcoin (PEP) A new meme coin claimed to be the \u201cretard cousin ov Pepe\u201d called pepcoin (PEP) is up 1,150% on Friday. But, as per DEXTools, it market cap was last only around $60,000 with $25,000 in liquidity and 220 holders. That means a very small volume of sales could trigger a huge price crash. Traders should be very cautious of such an illiquid coin. A Better Way to Make Quick Gains Shitcoins offer the prospect of quick gains, but are very risky. That\u2019s not just due to their illiquidity and volatility. Its also due to the fact that most are scams of some sort, or pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project\u2019s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first. Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects. Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.

XRP fell as much as 16% at its lows to around $0.51, which marked new two-month lows. The latest XRP price collapse means it has now reversed 27% lower versus its 2024 highs. The XRP price has dropped back over 25% from its recent highs / Source: TradingView And XRP price predictions could be about to get a lot more bearish. XRP Price Prediction \u2013 Recovery to $1 Incoming? With XRP now sharply below its major moving averages, focus is turning to a test of a long-term uptrend. Indeed, the XRP price has followed an uptrend going all the way back to its early 2023 lows. Should this uptrend break, a short-term retest of support in the $0.43-46 area. Even a break under $0.40 could be on the cards. XRP price predictions would get very bearish if it broke below this long-term uptrend / Source: TradingView Of course, assuming the broader market is in a bullish phase, such a dip would probably be bought into. But whether a recovery to $1 is incoming remains difficult to predict. Ripple Labs maintains winning momentum in its lawsuit versus the SEC. A judge ruled last year that Ripple Labs\u2019 sales of XRP didn\u2019t necessarily constitute a security transaction. And Ripple Labs predicts that its winning momentum will encourage banks to begin using its XRP-powered global payments solution. That could substantially boost XRP\u2019s adoption. That being said, concerns remain about XRP\u2019s lack of decentralization. Moreover, many are concerned that XRP lacks a major use case, when compared to other major cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The former is increasingly viewed as digital gold, while the latter two are fast-growing smart-contract blockchains and the homes of fast-growing decentralized finance and application ecosystems. Crypto Alternatives to Consider XRP investors would be right to be concerned about the cryptocurrency\u2019s near-term price risks. Sometimes traders hunting quick gains often turn to the shitcoin markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes.

The proceedings also included the directors of these mining schemes: Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten.

The regulator applied for these orders because it thinks investors in these crypto-mining schemes \u201care at risk of dissipation.\u201d Crypto Mining Collapse Leaves Investors $41 Million in the Red The crypto mining firms collapsed into liquidation owing 450 investors more than USD $41 million. The companies allegedly targeted investors to establish self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and then converted them into cryptocurrency. \u201cASIC alleges in the proceedings that the NGS Companies contravened section 911A of the Corporations Act by providing financial services without an Australian financial services license,\u201d the release read. The regulator is now holding the companies accountable for illegally marketing investment products backed by crypto mining. ASIC Chair Joe Longo warned investors to consider risks before using their SMSF to invest in crypto-related investments like mining. \u201cThese proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinized by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers,\u201d he said.

Robert Kiyosaki Claims Bitcoin ETFs Are For Institutions In an X post, Robert Kiyosaki shared his opinion that spot Bitcoin ETFs and other asset-backed \u201cETFs are best for most people and institutions.\u201d Q: Will you buy the Bitcoin ETF? A: No. Just as I own gold and silver coin and mines and own apartment houses I do not own gold or silver ETFs or REITS, real estate ETFS. ETFs are best for most people and institutions. Personally I am an entrepreneur and prefer to stay as far\u2026 \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 12, 2024 Having invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, and real estate, which he said are bargains today, Kiyosaki is sticking to his guns. He believes in making his own financial moves that align with his entrepreneurial spirit. However, the renowned author reiterated that investors should always choose what is best for them, noting that his stance against Bitcoin ETFs works best for him. If he makes a mistake, he has no one else to blame but himself, he noted. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETFs market is at an all-time high, with tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) picking up pace. CoinShares data showed that cryptocurrency investment products, including Bitcoin ETFs, have recorded positive inflows of late. Total inflows were $646 million on April 8, and the year-to-date (YTD) inflow was $13.8B, the highest volume ever recorded. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, predicted an upward shift towards the tokenization of RWAs, such as bonds issued on blockchains, during a Chainalysis Links Conference held in New York. Robert Kiyosaki Endorses Cathie Woods BTC Price Prediction The remarks of Robert Kiyosaki, who has always been bullish on Bitcoin, came on the heels of the bullish price prediction made by Cathie Woods, the founder of Ark Invest asset management firm, who has been optimistic about the prospect of spot Bitcoin ETFs encouraging institutions to invest in Bitcoin. During the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22, Wood stated that the BTC price could soar to $2.3M per token. NEW: \"Cathie Wood guarantees #Bitcoin will hit $2.3M per #BTC.

And most importantly, \u2018How many Bitcoin do you own?\u2019 If Kathie is right, I will wish I bought more.\u201d While Kiyosaki and Cathie Wood might disagree on ETFs, they both see immense potential in Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrency prices dumped on Friday as leverage long futures position liquidations spiked / Source: coinglass.com Most of the aforementioned altcoins are at least 25% down from recent highs. Some, like Arbitrum and Bonk, are down over 50% from yearly highs. Indeed, it had already been an ugly few weeks for most alternative cryptocurrency prices, even prior to Friday\u2019s sharp. After a strong finish to 2023/start to 2024 that saw many major altcoins posting 2-3x or more gains, as well as Bitcoin recovering to new record highs, momentum has stalled, and profit-taking has taken over. Jitters about a Bitcoin halving related turbulence, fading Fed rate cut bets and geopolitics have added fresh reasons to derisk. Where Next For Cryptocurrency Prices? It remains far too early to say definitively that the latest drop in cryptocurrency prices is over. After all, there remains plenty of room left for escalation between Iran and Israel. The altcoin pullback presents a great opportunity for investors to get in at bargain prices versus a few weeks ago. But anyone jumping into the market now should be ready for significant two-way volatility. Or, if they fancy buying a crypto that carries a much lower risk of near-term 15% intra-day moves, there\u2019s Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin has dropped 5% in 24 hours on risk off flows. But trading in the $67,000s, BTC is only down 8% from the record highs it hit near $74,000 last month. Moreover, it remains locked well within recent ranges. That could reflect the fact that many view Bitcoin to actually be a safe haven asset, much like gold. And its general resilience in recent weeks could reflect a reluctance to sell ahead of the halving/amid ETF optimism. While a post-halving \u201csell-the-fact\u201d reaction could see Bitcoin dip back towards the $60,000s, its outlook remains strong. Prior halvings have typically been followed by huge price run-ups to fresh record levels within a few months. Big US deficit spending and global central bank easing suggests that macro will remain a tailwind. That\u2019s even if the Fed is comparatively slow to begin cutting rates, amid robust US data. And finally, institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has added a new, long-term source of buy pressure to the market. $100,000 Bitcoin for later this year remains very much on the cards. Bitcoin could dip back to $60,000 amid a broad downturn in cryptocurrency prices / Source: TradingView And that suggests that, while the near-term altcoin outlook is bumpy, traders should brace for strong comebacks later this year.

Justice Mellor found that: 1) Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper. 2) Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto. 3) Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. 4) Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software. 1/4 \u2014 COPA (@opencryptoorg) March 14, 2024 \u201cFor over eight years, Dr. Wright and his financial backers have lied about his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto and used that lie to bully and intimidate developers in the bitcoin community,\u201d COPA posted to their X account shortly after the ruling. \u201cThat ends today with the court\u2019s ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201d In fact, a recent linguistic analysis of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s writing shows that the enigmatic founding father of crypto may be a collective group, not just one individual. Shortly after the ruling, UK Judge James Mellor froze the entirety of Wright\u2019s assets after he attempted to transfer several of his London firm\u2019s shares to a Singapore-based entity, potentially in a bid to evade financial penalties related to the case.

The stablecoin market has also grown more competitive. For example, XRP issuer Ripple recently announced plans to launch a United States dollar-backed stablecoin. Launching a stablecoin is a natural step for Ripple as we bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto. We have 1/ the years of experience 2/ regulatory footprint 3/ a strong balance sheet and 4/ a network with near global payout coverage, to offer the best of\u2026 https://t.co/GlyqhYl9ES \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) April 4, 2024 Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will likely compete with the two most dominant stablecoin issuers, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). The supply of Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC expanded by nearly $10 billion combined over the past month. Is The Bull Market Driving Stablecoin Demand? Interestingly, increasing demand for stablecoins coincides with the current crypto bull market. Yet while stablecoin growth may be correlated with increasing cryptocurrency prices, industry experts believe demand for digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar are surging for other reasons. Austin Campbell, Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, told Cryptonews that while there is a correlation between stablecoins and the wider crypto market cap, it has been declining over time. \u201cIt appears that stablecoins are being used independently of crypto trading for payments,\u201d said Campbell. He added that dollar-backed stablecoins are addressing a broader market segment compared to digital assets solely used for speculation. Stablecoin Use Cases For Payments On The Rise Their utility may be increasing as well, as a number of stablecoin payment use cases are coming to fruition. For example, David Uhryniak, Head of TRON Ecosystem Development, told Cryptonews that an app called Grab \u2013 known as the \u201cUber of Singapore\u201d \u2013 recently began accepting USDT on TRON for payments. \u201cTRC20-USDT holders can now pay for their rides or food delivery directly without converting to fiat currency,\u201d said Uhryniak. \u201cI expect a growing trend where more international e-commerce platforms will integrate with TRON to accept crypto transactions for everyday services.\u201d According to Uhryniak, the TRON blockchain has become one of the preferred transport layers for popular stablecoins like USDT due to its low transaction fees and fast processing. \u201cTRON has the highest circulating supply of USDT, at over $54.8 billion,\u201d said Uhryniak. \u201cSince early February of this year, USDT on TRON has been averaging over 2 million transactions daily.\u201d Jelena Djuric, CEO and Co-Founder of digital asset issuance chain Noble, told Cryptonews that while stablecoins can be used for decentralized finance (DeFi), the platform has recently seen a surge in stablecoins for payments. \u201cAn example of this is being seen with Cypher Wallet, where users can load USDC from Noble and spend those dollars in stores wherever Mastercard is accepted,\u201d said Djuric. Djuric added that she believes the most interesting stablecoin use cases currently focus on digital dollars. \u201cStablecoins are more convenient, efficient and scalable than the traditional financial rails,\u201d she said. Djuric shared that Noble is currently handling $1 billion of volume per month of USDC transactions from the platform to other Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol chains. \u201cWe have grown USDC issuance more than most other native issuance chains for the past few months. This represents real adoption by users and Dapp chains that plug into Noble for liquidity,\u201d said Djuric. Massimiliano Silenzi, CEO of research firm Cryptorefills Labs, told Cryptonews that recent findings from Cryptorefills show almost 80 percent of crypto-shoppers prefer to pay for goods and services with stablecoins versus other cryptocurrencies. Source: Cryptorefills While notable, Silenzi pointed out that due to transaction speeds and fees, only one-sixth of stablecoin payments take place on the Ethereum mainnet. \u201cThe majority of stablecoin payments are dispersed fairly evenly across alternative networks like Polygon, TRON, Solana, and Avalanche as well as Ethereum layer-2s like Optimism and Arbitrum,\u201d said Silenzi. \u201cAs a result, when it comes to stablecoin payment networks that are quick, inexpensive, and scalable, there isn\u2019t yet a clear winner.\u201d Challenges May Hamper Stablecoin Adoption While it\u2019s notable that stablecoin adoption may be increasing due to real-world payment use cases, regulations and other concerns may slow adoption. For instance, while stablecoin legislation may get passed this year in the U.S., Senator Elizabeth Warren recently criticized the proposed stablecoin bill. As Cryptonews previously reported, Warren argues that creating new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins could \u201camplify and entrench\u201d risks they pose to the American banking sector. Moreover, David Pope, Commissioner of The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, told Cryptonews that tax rules around stablecoins remain a barrier to adoption as well. \u201cThe IRS views all crypto (including Stablecoins) as property (as opposed to cash),\u201d said Pope. \u201cThis means whenever a US person or entity uses a stablecoin for anything, it has to be reported on their tax return (even though there is normally no gain or loss).\u201d Pope believes that if stablecoins become commonly used, this will likely result in thousands of transactions needing to be documented. In addition to regulations, Djuric believes that non-crypto natives still struggle with Web3 concepts such as private keys, wallets, on-ramps, bridged versions of the same stablecoins, and more. \u201cNoble is trying to solve all of these challenges, but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Eventually, we should see chain and asset abstraction as secure but highly intuitive wallet interfaces,\u201d she said. Indeed, these challenges may eventually lead to decreasing demand in stablecoins. For instance, Paxos\u2019 most recent transparency report on PayPal USD noted the circulation of PYUSD in March totaled $188.5 million. This marks a 39% decrease in PayPal\u2019s stablecoin compared to the previous month. Ways To Ensure Stablecoin Growth Moving Forward Challenges aside, Campbell believes that stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto space matures. \u201cStablecoins will probably outgrow DeFi and become a tool for real-world payments around the globe,\u201d he said. Although adoption may be slow, education, along with retail demand for stablecoins, will ensure growth in the future. Notably, Tether is already taking steps to provide better stablecoin education. On April 10, Tether announced a partnership with Coins.ph \u2013 a popular digital asset exchange in the Philippines \u2013 to promote financial education for blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and stablecoins in the region. According to a Tether blog post, the educational initiatives being launched will target diverse segments of the Filipino population. This includes finance professionals like bankers and fintech companies, but also overseas Filipino workers seeking efficient remittance solutions. Pope also believes that as the general public moves through the learning curve, retail demand for stablecoins will increase. \u201cThis all suggests that stablecoins are slowly being adopted,\u201d he said. \u201cBut can anyone buy their cup of morning coffee with them yet? Probably very few places accept a wallet transfer for that, but adoption does seem to be moving along.\u201d The post Payment Use Cases Fuel Increasing Stablecoin Growth appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"The global stablecoin supply currently stands at over $150 billion, demonstrating new demand for relatively stable digital assets.

This concern was outlined in a paper presented by Cardell during an Antitrust Law Spring Meeting in Washington on April 11. UK Competition and Markets Authority Concerned over Potential Market Exploitation Cardell, head of the regulatory body, has expressed concern that Big Tech investments in the artificial intelligence sector could stifle competition. \u201cThe essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We\u2019re committed to applying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at our disposal \u2013 now and in the future \u2013 to ensure that this transformational and structurally critical technology delivers on its promise,\u201d Cardell explained. According to the CMA boss, there\u2019s an \u201cinterconnected web of over 90 partnerships and strategic investments involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia (the leading supplier of AI accelerator chips).\u201d We\u2019ve outlined our growing concerns in the #AI #foundationmodels market, including 3 key interlinked risks to fair, open and effective competition.

The CMA chief outlines three specific dangers: Control over inputs: Big Tech could gain control of essential AI inputs like data and specialized chips. Limiting choice: Companies could leverage existing market power to limit user options for AI services. Anti-competitive alliances: These tech giants could form partnerships explicitly to concentrate market power and hinder innovation. Big Tech Firms Invest Massively In Artificial Intelligence Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have invested billions in AI development, hiring top talent and building products for vast user bases. Microsoft\u2019s backing of OpenAI (the creators of ChatGPT and leading model GPT-4) is a prime example. These investments, while fueling progress, also solidify their positions as gatekeepers within the industry. The CMA recognizes the potential benefits of AI and the expertise these corporations possess. However, Cardell worries that smaller companies could be squeezed out if the current trend continues.

But such a retracement wouldn\u2019t snap the thesis that BTC remains in a bull market. Throughout its history, within a few months of the halving, Bitcoin has always pumped to new record highs. Add to that picture that the US continues to run a big deficit, that rate cuts are coming sooner or later, that ETF demand should continue to act as a long-term tailwind, and that the 2024 Presidential election could see the US political and regulatory landscape shift in a more pro-crypto direction, $100,000 remains on the cards for later this year.

It was last trading with gains of roughly 2% in the past 24 hours near $0.15, as per CoinMarketCap. Its low market cap of under $4 billion, despite its link to one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, suggests plenty of room left for growth this bull market.

Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer investors the opportunity to potentially make quick gains. But some traders are on the lookout for much faster gains than major altcoins can offer. These traders often turn to the shitcoin markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project\u2019s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first. Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects. Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.

TAO Price Falls After Binance Listing as Spotlight Shifts to Solana\u2019s Hidden New Coin","author":"Tim Hakki","article_detailed_content":"Cutting edge AI token Bittensor (TAO) has fallen 20% in 24 hours to trade at $572, only a day after listing on Binance in what looks like \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the news\u201d trading activity, according to data by Coin Gecko. Bittensor is a pioneering peer-to-peer (p2p) machine learning protocol that incentivizes participants to train machine learners across a global decentralized network of nodes. By spreading the computing load across multiple nodes, the Bittensor team hopes to create a collaborative and open-source AI training ecosystem that will rival the more centralized machine learning systems used by corporations like Google and IBM. Bittensor employs a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. PoI is an alternative to Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) model, where the nodes with the most computing power validate the most transactions and mine the most BTC. It also differs to the Proof-of-Stake model used by Ethereum, where the nodes that staked the most ETH validate the most transactions. Bittensor is currently the number one AI-related cryptocurrency with a market cap of nearly $4 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of just over $230k. Is it too late to buy AI token Bittensor (TAO)? Given the sudden price drop, it\u2019s definitely not too late to buy TAO. TAO is frontrunning an AI token sector that will rise to prominence in the coming years once tech companies in jurisdictions across the world are confident about both crypto and AI regulation. In fact, some would argue the depreciation is welcome because it offers new buyers a chance to get in at a discount ahead of a potential future rally. However, Bittensor\u2019s trading chart has followed a slightly different narrative to more mainstream cryptocurrencies over the last three months. While, broadly speaking, the price has gone up over the period examined, it has not moved in tandem with the rest of the market. According to the trading chart, the transition from February to March was more volatile for TAO than more leading cryptocurrencies. Having said that, the token has found strong support around $600 and is only trading 22% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of $757.60 set a month ago, March 8. Source: TradingView However, TAO\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44 and falling, which indicates there could be further losses over the next 24 hours. Beyond AI Tokens Like TAO: Solana Meme Coins are Worth Watching If AI related tokens and protocols are undoubtedly the blockchain\u2019s next technological leap, then Solana meme coins are its next cultural one. Bittensor is a good, solid cryptocurrency to invest in. Sure, it has its risks. As with all cryptocurrency investments, people should only invest what they\u2019re prepared to lose, but Bittensor\u2019s Proof-of-Intelligence concept and decentralized AI-training model are revolutionary USPs for any token. Meme coins are another promising sector and Solana meme coins are some of the buzziest right now. The network\u2019s latest star is a 420-friendly sloth with big dreams. In just three weeks, traders have poured well over $10 million into an ICO for new Solana meme coin Slothana ($SLOTH) to try and recapture some of the early upside potential of recently profitable Solana funny tokens like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk. Slothana isn\u2019t lazy, although he certainly appears that way. High on ambition (and surreptitious toking), he\u2019s eyeing the clock hands, waiting for 4:20 because from there, he hopes to get to $420 million. Word on the grapevine says Slothana is by the same team that launched Smog (SMOG), which rallied strongly after ending its presale and listing. Early investors hope to capture that explosive upside potential ahead of a Slothana listing. The clock is ticking and the $SLOTH team has not confirmed launch dates, so the presale window duration is an enigma. Got FOMO?

SHORK Price Analysis: Is Shork Coin On The Verge of a Second Rally Leg? As price action pushes to the upside once more, SHORK is currently trading at a market price of $0.035 (representing a 24-hour change of +15,030%). This comes after the token launched at just Midnight UTC in a DEX listing on Raydium. It gained almost instant traction, and its price surged +10,000% in the first three hours. Resistance at $0.062 sent the price tumbling into a strong consolidation pattern above lower support at $0.0225, setting the stage for a further push to SHORK\u2019s current all-time high at $0.067. Yet, with the all-time high delivering +50,000% returns to SHORK holders, early-backed moved for a quickfire sell-off around 6 AM UTC \u2013 sending the price tumbling back to support. However, defying expectations, the support level has once again been successfully defended by holders \u2013 and SHORK price is once again on the climb \u2013 teasing the potential of a second rally leg. The volatile price action has been fuelled by significant interest from retail investors, represented by an impressive $58m in 24-hour trading volume. Now standing at a $41m market cap, interest threatens to wane, with the prospect of a major return for late-stage investors diminished to a generous 5x expectation at these levels. Remarkably, despite more than 8,000 holders, bulls remain in control \u2013 with buy pressure representing 51% of transactions over the past hour.

He talked about his gradual and intentional switch from a professional sports player to a crypto entrepreneur, accepting Bitcoin as salary seven years ago, establishing a staking-as-a-service, and chains coming to Myrmidon soon. Rosenthal told us why ETFs are useful but go against the basic crypto ethos, and how Myrmidon ensures true coin ownership. Lastly, he discussed the pros and cons of the four staking types: which one is the most difficult but most beneficial earning-wise and which one is the least. In this interview, Rosenthal discussed: being the first athlete to accept BTC as salary in 2017; Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider; what\u2019s going on with Ethereum; the implications of Ethereum ETF; solo-home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking. You can watch what Rosenthal told Matt in the video above or read it below. From Hokey Player to Crypto Player There\u2019s a pattern in the world of sports, Rosenthal said. Players retire and then feel like they\u2019ve lost their identity. They struggle to live outside the sports world. Rosenthal didn\u2019t want this happening to him, so he started spreading out career-wise early on. Being a pro hockey player in the US or Canada pays very well. In Europe, too, a player can \u201cmake a pretty good living.\u201d But making money post-retirement is difficult. Rosenthal returned from the US to Europe, well aware that his career would come to its inevitable end. Therefore, he went to study and earn his degrees from the Copenhagen Business School. Also, in 2016, he fell \u201cdeep down the rabbit hole\u201d of crypto through Danish Bitcoin entrepreneur Niklas Nikolajsen, who founded Bitcoin Suisse AG in 2013. This path ultimately led to Rosenthal becoming the first athlete to accept Bitcoin as a salary in 2017. Many would certainly think this a very strange and/or bad financial decision at the time. Bitcoin and the world of crypto were very different seven years ago, and they were perceived differently in the mainstream. But it turned out to be an excellent decision, and there are multiple athletes today accepting their salary in crypto. And \u201cI definitely orange-pilled a couple of boys, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Rosenthal said. He noted how relative the term \u2018early\u2019 is. In 2016 he used to think of those who had gotten into the space in 2015 or 2013 as being early. But now that he looks back, he was early too. Anybody who gets in today will likely be \u2018early\u2019 for somebody entering the space in 2030, let\u2019s say. No Competitor for Ethereum Yet Rosenthal eventually went on to co-found Myrmidon in 2022. It\u2019s a non-custodial staking provider primarily focused on Ethereum. The CEO commented that \u201ctoday, Ethereum is still the biggest L1 chain out there.\u201d There are some layer-1 blockchains competing with it, including Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. But \u201cthe bottom line is that Ethereum is still the one to beat, in my view,\u201d Rosenthal remarked. Since the last time Rosenthal was a guest at Cryptonews Podcast back in 2021, Ethereum has undergone a number of major upgrades. And \u201ceverything went smoothly,\u201d he said. Congratulations to the entire #Ethereum community on a succesful Dencun upgrade on epoch 269,568. Here are some of the most important things you need to know about the upgrade : pic.twitter.com/zQbYLS0ELg \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) March 14, 2024 An issue, Rosenthal argued, is that some people may not understand what an update is supposed to do, expecting it to do something else \u2013 for example, lower the fees, which are a major pain point for Ethereum. A negative narrative is then created around the chain when an upgrade doesn\u2019t do what it wasn\u2019t supposed to do in the first place. Though he doesn\u2019t fully understand why there has been so much negativity recently directed at Ethereum, Rosenthal remarked that it does follow historical patterns of \u201cETH getting hammered, Bitcoin taking off.\u201d The latter is up primarily because of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval is the US. And Ethereum ETFs are expected to follow. And while personally he doesn\u2019t \u201creally care about the ETF,\u201d the entrepreneur finds it beneficial for adoption. That said, \u201clong-term, ETH ETF or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter for the adoption of ETH because I can\u2019t really see a competitor to ETH as it is right now,\u201d Rosenthal opined. Case Against ETF and For True Ownership Going deeper into the ETF argument, Rosenthal argued that \u201cit\u2019s a great product for the average person out there.\u201d It\u2019s an easy way to enter the space and get exposure to the asset class. But there is a big \u2018but\u2019. It\u2019s counter-crypto. Crypto, Rosenthal says, was invented for people to custody their own assets and always maintain full control. The Bitcoin ETF is, by default, not a product that allows this. People make different choices when managing their assets. And it likely can\u2019t be expected that everybody will self-custody. However, \u201cfor me, the underlying asset and owning the underlying asset is really what matters,\u201d Rosenthal said. This is why the Myrmidon team made the non-custodial solution, Ethereum Staking Dashboard, enabling people to easily stake their ETH without losing control over it. The stakers don\u2019t give up their keys, and they also earn yield. There is a saying in #crypto \u2013 \"Not your keys, not your coins\" That's why we're all about native non-custodial #Ethereum staking So why pick us? 1\u20e3 You have 100% validator control 2\u20e3 0% protocol rewards fee 3\u20e3 100% native staking Get started todayhttps://t.co/NaG7pWH6Og pic.twitter.com/JDHoHzUJm8 \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) February 14, 2024 Notably, Rosenthal explained, Ethereum staking is a bit different. Most proof-of-stake blockchains use delegation: for example, you delegate ADA or SOL to the stake provider. However, if you want to stake your ETH, you have to make a transaction to the Beacon chain, and if you want to get the ETH back, you have to send the correct data to unlock it, the entrepreneur said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated process,\u201d Rosenthal opined. And because it\u2019s difficult for many to understand, they turn to centralized exchanges. This choice comes with its own set of security risks. Therefore, Myrmidon enabled people to stake their ETH, maintain ownership over it, and exit the staking position easily. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a friendly UI for ETH staking, which is not very UI-friendly,\u201d Rosenthal said. The downside of Myrmidon\u2019s service is that it must support native ETH staking, which means that users must stake 32 ETH per validator. That said, \u201cas of yet, we haven\u2019t found one single provider [besides Myrmidon] who can safely say that they are truly non-custodial staking providers.\u201d Hence, unlike Myrmidon, should something happen with the provider, the users\u2019 ETH is gone forever. The Four Staking Categories: Pros and Cons Rosenthal went on to discuss the four categories of staking. These are solo home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking. He explained that we can observe these categories as listed from the most to the least decentralized, from the most difficult to the easiest, and from the most secure to the least secure. Solo home staking is the hardest and requires the most knowledge and work, given the constant updates. But it\u2019s also the most decentralized, the most secure, and the most rewarding. Staking-as-a-service is what Myrmidon does. It\u2019s a very decentralized way to stake ETH, and it\u2019s also not easy. However, if you know how to operate a wallet, you can choose this option. Did you know #MyrmidonStaking offers a user-friendly platform for staking #Ethereum kinda like the launchpad? It's actually more like a dashboard and launchpad in one built right into our staking solution, which is 100% non-custodial No messing around with extra smart\u2026 pic.twitter.com/RvkXnncsyx \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) April 9, 2024 Pool staking is a very popular solution. For one, it doesn\u2019t require 32 ETH, but only 0.1 ETH. It\u2019s easy and convenient. But the big issues are smart contract risk and centralization. The final option is the easiest and the riskiest one: centralized staking. Here, the centralized exchanges do the work for you. They don\u2019t require 32 ETH either. At the same time, stakers give up control over their assets. Furthermore, the yield gets significantly lower as you go further down the list. For example, those who use staking-as-a-service, get all base rewards, hence they earn more. More Chains Incoming The Myrmidon team has so far primarily been focused on Ethereum. However, that\u2019s not to say they haven\u2019t worked with other chains or started planning support for additional chains. \u201cYou should definitely check our website because we\u2019re going to pop up new networks over course of 2024,\u201d Rosenthal said. Just recently, the team launched Cardano, which is \u201coff to a great start.\u201d Users can now delegate their ADA coins via Myrmidon. Hey #CardanoCommunity We are live with our cardano stake pool Name: Myrmidon Ticker: MYR Fixed cost: 170\u20b3 Margin: 5% Some facts about #MyrmidonStaking (us) 1\u20e3 We host our nodes in house 2\u20e3 We are a non-custodial staking service provider 3\u20e3 We are a team of 5 people\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5myTN1ag2D \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) April 3, 2024 They are also live with the Danish-founded blockchain Concordium. \u201cWe run the largest pool as a third-party provider for that ecosystem,\u201d said Rosenthal. Therefore, the company supports three networks currently, while the fourth \u2013 Fleek \u2013 is expected to go live this summer, in Q3. Myrmidon will not launch any chains before it has customers on them, Rosenthal stressed. Running various networks without customers is wasting time and effort that can be put elsewhere. This is especially true for Myrmidon, which hosts everything in-house and does not rely on third parties like Amazon or Google Cloud. Additionally, they focused on setting up a second server on a different energy grid as another security layer, which can take over should anything happen to the first one. Therefore, there is plenty to do at all times. And with their dashboard launched and doing well, these are \u201cgreat times, exciting times, exciting markets,\u201d Rosenthal concluded. _________ About Nikolaj Rosenthal Nikolaj Rosenthal is the Co-Founder and CEO of Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider.

This Bitcoin is the result of a $6.2 Billion wealth management fraud conducted between 2014 and 2017, fronted by Chinese company Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology. In which, more than 128,000 people were defrauded. The UK government became aware of the situation after ex-restaurant worker Jian Wen attempted to launder funds by purchasing a $30 million property with Bitcoin. However, the transaction could not be completed since Wen was unable to explain the source of the funds. This prompted an investigation, which culminated in a raid on a property rented by \u201cfront person\u201d Wen and her boss Zhimin Qian, the suspected mastermind of the operation. During the raid, investigators seized 61,000 Bitcoins, worth $1.7 billion at the time. Under pressure to explain the damning situation, Wen initially claimed that Bitcoin was mined. She eventually changed her story, stating it was a \u201clove present\u201d from Qian, who fled the country after the raid. Jian Wen was ultimately put on trial for assisting Qian in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewellery, and property. While Wen denied all charges, Southwark Crown Court convicted her guilty of three counts of money laundering on March 20th. Bitcoin Seized: The Victims Want What is Rightfully Theirs Following the conviction, a group representing the scam victims set out to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money, now worth $4.3 billion. The group reportedly submitted a letter to China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to negotiate with the UK government for the return of the \u201chuge amount\u201d of seized Bitcoin. They also contacted China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, claiming to have the backing of almost 2,500 signatures from the victims, and want to submit them to both ministries. The letter requests that the Chinese government and the UK judicial departments work together to submit evidence proving their status as \u201clegitimate owners.\u201d The group said: \u201cWe do not want, and will never accept, a situation where Bitcoins are confiscated by the UK and not returned to us.\u201d At the time of writing, the UK government had not issued a statement on how it intends to deal with the Bitcoin it holds, and Qian is still at large. However, if the UK government evaluates that no one else was entitled to the asset, it would typically be divided and distributed to the police and Home Office. However, the victims who \u201csuffered extremely serious economic losses, resulting in family breakdown, separation from their children, indebtedness, and no money for medical treatment,\u201d have not gone without aid. Four victims who lost money in the scam claim that, since last May, victims who enrolled with Chinese police have received two pay-outs from a task group on the fraud, headed by Tianjin authorities. They stated that 8% and 5% of their investment capital had been returned with assets recovered from Lantian Gerui and its former employees. Additionally, a local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country\u2019s largest lender, has committed to assisting with the return process and has estimated that 207,000 people invested in the fraudulent scheme.

This figure is an improvement compared to the net loss of 90.6 billion won in 2022. Gopax\u2019s revenue grew 97% year over year amid recovering market sentiment. GOPAX Reports Net Loss of $37 Million in 2023, Faces Challenges with GoFi-Linked Debt Gopax cash flow statement Site: Streamy On April 12, GOPAX released a financial statement that comprises its balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The balance sheets comprise the related statements of profit or loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for the years that ended. GOPAX reported a net loss of 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) for the fiscal year 2023. As of the end of the reporting period, the company\u2019s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by KRW 66 billion, and total liabilities exceeded total assets by KRW 101 billion. Most of Gopax\u2019s net losses stemmed from GoFi-linked debt, from deposits stuck in Genesis Global Capital. Genesis, which operated Gopax\u2019s crypto custody service GoFi, suspended withdrawals in November 2022 due to a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement with FTX. According to the financial report, GoFi still owes users 63.7 billion won. Despite the continued net losses, Gopax exhibited favorable year-over-year performances in 2023. The exchange reported a significant increase in revenue, which surged by 97% to reach 3.1 billion won. Furthermore, the net operating loss decreased substantially, contracting 78% to approximately 17 billion won. The resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean cryptocurrency market propelled Gopax\u2019s enhanced financial results in 2023. Notably, South Korea remained one of the most active crypto markets globally, with the South Korean won overtaking the U.S. dollar as the primary fiat trading pair for cryptocurrencies in November 2023, according to Bloomberg. Binance Grapples with Regulatory Delays and Financial Strain in Gopax Acquisition Binance acquired Gopax at the end of 2022 to address the latter\u2019s liquidity challenges and expand Binance\u2019s presence in the South Korean market. However, financial authorities have been delaying the acceptance of Gopax\u2019s change of virtual asset business report for over a year, impeding Binance\u2019s plans for market entry. Binance\u2019s decision to acquire Gopax was driven by the latter\u2019s inability to return funds to users following the FTX incident involving its virtual asset deposit service, \u2018GoFi.\u2019 Gopax Shareholders Source: Streamy Binance became the majority shareholder and took on the responsibility for GoFi\u2019s debt, appointing Leon Singh Pung, the former head of Binance Asia Pacific, as CEO of Gopax. Despite submitting a report on the change in virtual asset business to the FIU, the decision regarding its acceptance has been consistently postponed. Gopax later replaced its CEO with former CEO Lee Jung-hoon and submitted another change report, but the FIU continued to delay its decision. In response to these challenges, Binance has initiated discussions to reduce its shares in Gopax to become the second-largest shareholder. This strategic move will alleviate Gopax\u2019s financial burdens and regulatory compliance pressures. Binance CEO Richard Teng even traveled to Seoul in March to engage with local financial regulators to address these concerns. As of the latest financial report, Binance remains the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake. However, a Binance spokesperson has stated that there are no updates regarding any changes to Binance\u2019s ownership stake in Gopax.

While FLOKI is up by 2.5% in a week, it has now declined by 30% in a week, although the popular meme coin has posted a 460% increase in the last 12 months. This is very impressive performance, and with FLOKI remaining popular among retail investors and whales, it could easily see a recovery in the coming weeks. This is particularly the case when the market is waiting on a possible surge, which could coincide with the next Bitcoin halving on April 20. Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 4% Overnight \u2013 What\u2019s Going On? One encouraging feature of FLOKI\u2019s chart is that it has bounced a little in the past hour, after dropping earlier this morning. This could mean that it has bottomed out as far as its recent decline is concerned, a claim which receives some tentative reinforcement from its support line (green). Source: TradingView It\u2019s also notable that FLOKI\u2019s 30-day average (orange) has reached what looks like a bottom in relation to the 200-day (blue), implying that the coin has entered an oversold position and is ready to rebound. Having said that, FLOKI\u2019s trading volume remains largely lowkey at $150 million, whereas it rose as high as $2 billion in early March. What we can take from this is that whales have yet to return to the meme token, despite having pumped it vigorously in the weeks preceding its last big surge. $FLOKI: It seems that price is still in a wave-iv correction. Ideal target for wave-C is the 100% Fib extension level at $0.000137. A break above $0.000266 would be the first sign that wave-iv already has bottomed. pic.twitter.com/RSt5KjF9bi \u2014 Man of Bitcoin (@Manofbitcoin) April 12, 2024 Yet given that the coin has been down for several weeks now, it may be a good time to buy it, given that it\u2019s selling at a relative discount. Indeed, the next week or so may see the crypto market rally as a whole, helped by the incoming Bitcon halving, which is due in eight days. And the Floki price could ride any resulting bull market, with the token continuing to attract new exchange listings that could support it in the long run. More importantly, it also has a detailed and ambitious roadmap that should help improve its utility and fundamentals. FLOKI ROADMAP: WHAT\u2019S NEXT ON OUR AGENDA\u2026 From the get-go, we\u2019ve been VERY clear about our goal for Floki: To be the most known and most used cryptocurrency in the world. Our new roadmap outlines how we intend to achieve this:https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH pic.twitter.com/hBydq4D4lX \u2014 FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) March 22, 2024 For this reason, the Floki price should reach $0.00025 in the next couple of months, before reaching $0.00035 in the latter half of the year. Newer Meme Tokens May Bring Bigger Returns While FLOKI remains one of the most popular meme coins in the market, it isn\u2019t the only promising token available right now. Numerous newer meme coins have emerged in the past few weeks, with several holding presales that not only help support their development, but also help them attract supporters prior to listing. One coin doing this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme token that has raised more than $2.8 million in its increasingly popular sale. Embracing Inclusive Accessibility! $DOGEVERSE opens its doors to a wide audience, from #Ethereum aficionados to those preferring the rapid, cost-effective benefits of #Solana or #Polygon, fostering a diverse and inclusive community. pic.twitter.com/sXPOvaoz67 \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 12, 2024 What\u2019s so exciting about Dogeverse is that it\u2019s one of the only meme tokens in the market to make itself multi-chain. It will launch on Ethereum, before bridging to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base. What this means is that it will find applications and uses in multiple ecosystems and platforms, something which could raise its demand in relation to other similar tokens. It also comes with bullish tokenomics, with its capped supply of 200 million tokens ultimately making it a deflationary token. And unlike the original Dogecoin, holders will be able to stake DOGEVERSE, earning themselves a passive income in addition to any price gains. #DOGEVERSE bringing in optimized costs and speed! Users enjoy the ability to choose chains with lower transaction fees and faster processing times, significantly enhancing the trading and transaction experience. pic.twitter.com/phcMnBhwLT \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 11, 2024 All in all, the use of multiple chains will make DOGEVERSE one of the fastest and most useful tokens in the crypto ecosystem. Investors can join its presale by heading over to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000293. The presale has an allocation of 15% of the coin\u2019s overall supply, with 10% going to staking and 50% going to marketing and project funds (a further 15% goes to liquidity and another 10% to its ecosystem). Given how quickly the sale is raising money, it may sell out fairly soon, so interested parties are advised to act quickly.

For UNI holders, this peaked when their token hit $16 and it has been in steady decline since, with the steepest losses posted in the last 48 hours. According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, a sell-off, which gained momentum on the eighth peaked yesterday when the RSI bottomed down to about 20.

Uniswap? DEXs? DeFi? Learn and earn with 99Bitcoins! Uniswap is DeFi\u2019s largest decentralized exchange (DEX). This means users can buy and sell a large inventory of cryptocurrencies as with centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but they have to self-custody their crypto. Some see this as a barrier to entry. While it\u2019s not difficult to select a wallet and begin trading crypto on DEXs, it\u2019s not as streamlined as whipping out a MasterCard, paying for it, and letting the exchange do the custodial work. Many lost faith in letting exchanges custody their crypto after the recession in 2021/2022, when crypto companies with liquidity troubles routinely paused withdrawals to head off bank runs. It culminated with the collapse of FTX, an exchange that had been sending billions of customer funds to its sister company, Alameda Research. Since these revelations, there has been growing attraction around DeFi and self-custodying crypto through decentralized wallets that give them control over their own private keys, like Uniswap\u2019s. If anything, the events of 2021 were a reminder to the industry on the importance of educating the public. The most important lesson people learned after FTX was the importance decentralization: the founding ethos of crypto. However, it can be overwhelming to crypto novices to know where to educate themselves. Luckily, there is a new crypto presale for an established crypto education project that hopes to revolutionize learning with its learn-to-earn model. 99Bitcoins is a heritage platform that brings with it a long-established community of 700,000 YouTube subscribers alongside 2 million registered users for its crypto courses. Through its revolutionary Learn-to-Earn model, 99Bitcoins uses a blend of gamification and a leaderboard reward system to make users feel like their learning is bearing tangible (spendable) benefits.

Recent investigations by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) suggest that while Australians aren\u2019t willing to shell out extra cash for the so-called safety perks of a digital central bank currency, they do put a price on privacy. We have released a Research Discussion Paper 'Valuing Safety and Privacy in Retail Central Bank Digital Currency' \u2013 https://t.co/Qmxwd9FmEh \u2014 Reserve Bank of Australia (@RBAInfo) April 12, 2024 Safety and Privacy Valuations A close look at the RBA\u2019s research reveals Australians\u2019 perspective on both safety and privacy when it comes to digital banking. The RBA pitched its hypothetical CBDC as a potentially safer and more private option than existing commercial bank offerings. Yet, the public\u2019s reaction was lukewarm at best regarding safety. Despite the RBA\u2019s role as a financial safety net and various protective measures already in place such as deposit insurance and bank supervision, the allure of a safer digital currency does not seem to tempt the average Australian wallet. Contrastingly, privacy is where the attention changes. Australians appear ready to pay up for enhanced privacy measures in their digital transactions. According to the RBA\u2019s findings, the average Aussie would prefer their transaction data to be accessible by the RBA rather than a commercial bank, even if it costs them around $5 more annually. When this preference is projected across the adult population, it translates into an approximate $100 million per year preference for privacy handled by the RBA over commercial banks, assuming all other conditions are constant. The Nuances of Consumer Choices The discrete choice experiment conducted by the RBA sheds light on how Australians value different aspects of digital banking. The study involves a choice scenario between two hypothetical bank accounts differing in their fee structures, data privacy levels, and managing entities. The set-up avoids direct references to CBDCs, leaning instead on more relatable banking analogies to gauge public interest and understanding. This method, while complex, is critical for understanding real-world preferences without the skewed results that might come from less sophisticated survey techniques. Fees and privacy settings are randomized in the survey to ensure that the data reflects genuine preferences free from bias introduced by price or convenience factors. Further dissecting the demographics, it emerges that age and income play significant roles in how individuals value these banking attributes. Lower income individuals place a higher value on safety than their wealthier counterparts, possibly due to a more acute awareness of financial vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the use of cash, which offers high privacy and safety, was also analyzed to understand its impact on preferences for digital banking features. The survey results also suggest a robust attachment to traditional banking services, with a clear preference for features that align closely with existing offerings. This implies a significant challenge for the adoption of a CBDC in Australia unless it can offer a clear and unique value proposition, especially in areas like privacy that currently resonate with the public. With this comprehensive exploration into the preferences of Australians regarding digital currencies and banking privacy, the RBA has provided valuable insights. However, the question remains whether these preferences will steer future policies or if the traditional banking framework will continue to dominate Australia.","article_summary":"Australia seems to have made its choice clear when it comes to banking preferences, showing a strong inclination for commercial banks over the proposed retail central bank digital currency (CBDC).

This collaboration was highlighted during a meeting between Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where they discussed strategies to propel this financial transformation. Reinforcing the Multipolar Vision China and Russia have committed to advocating for a multipolar world and spreading this ideal among developing nations. Their plan includes shifting away from the US dollar in international transactions in favor of local currencies. The two countries have voiced their concerns about the US imposing what they consider \u201cillegal sanctions\u201d on them, prompting a coordinated effort through BRICS to counteract these measures. Their aim is clear: to overhaul the global governance system by rallying developing nations against US economic sanctions. In their quest for global financial reform, China and Russia are embarking on a tour across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. They are promoting the benefits of abandoning the US dollar (de-dollarization) and embracing the concept of a multipolar world. My man Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of these initiatives, stating, \u201cChina values the development of Sino-Russian relations highly and is eager to enhance bilateral communication and strategic coordination within BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, to foster unity among Global South countries and push for the reform of the global governance system.\u201d The success of these efforts, however, remains uncertain, as it depends on how other developing countries respond to the idea of a multipolar world. Although the de-dollarization agenda is already underway, the broader concept of a multipolar world is gradually gaining acceptance. The Golden Strategy: China\u2019s Economic Maneuver Amidst all of these, China is strategically increasing its influence in the gold market, causing prices to soar to unprecedented heights. The recent record high of $2,342.43 per ounce is a testament to this trend. This surge in gold prices is largely driven by the People\u2019s Bank of China, which has been aggressively purchasing gold. Economists note that gold\u2019s appeal lies in its liquidity, return potential, and stability during economic downturns, making it a robust alternative to the US dollar. As the US dollar weakens, partly due to its own internal struggles with inflation and interest rate hikes in 2023, other countries, led by BRICS, are finding the prospect of investing in gold increasingly appealing. This enthusiasm is mirrored in China\u2019s consistent increase in gold reserves, marked by a 16th consecutive month of growth in February, according to the World Gold Council. This bullish trend in gold is supported by central banks in emerging markets, which are also ramping up their gold reserves. Additionally, there is speculation that the new BRICS currency might be backed by gold, adding another layer of strategic depth to BRICS\u2019 financial maneuvers.

The BRICS is gaining momentum in their quest to cut ties with the U.S. dollar, potentially reshaping global economic supremacy. De-dollarization Dreams of BRICS This push towards abandoning the U.S. dollar in international dealings is not just a fleeting whim but a strategic plays rooted deeply in the BRICS countries\u2019 long-term economic plans. The bloc is actively seeking to enlarge its membership, inviting new countries to join in their movement towards using a BRICS currency or other local currencies instead. This expanding influence in trade and geopolitical matters signifies a possible shift in global power dynamics, challenging the U.S.\u2019s economic clout. The allure of joining BRICS extends to numerous nations, intrigued by the bloc\u2019s commitment to reshaping global financial infrastructure. This growing alliance represents over 40% of the global population and contributes about a quarter of the world\u2019s GDP. Their economic growth rates are currently eclipsing those of the U.S., which struggles with inflation and seesawing economic indicators. The shift in global trade patterns, favoring the BRICS nations, could further erode the U.S. dollar\u2019s hegemony and by extension, impact the U.S. economy and its burgeoning national debt. China, a major player within BRICS, boasts a significant trade surplus with the U.S., essentially selling more to America than it buys. This relationship feeds the U.S. trade deficit, effectively increasing the national debt as more dollars flow out than come in. Similarly, Brazil and India, as vital trade partners with the U.S., hold considerable sway over America\u2019s trade balance and debt levels through their economic policies and trade flows. Forecasting Fiscal Futures As the U.S. grapples with escalating national debt, the forecast isn\u2019t looking particularly sunny. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that by 2054, the U.S. national debt could reach a dizzying $141 trillion, which would be a staggering 166% of the projected GDP of $85.2 trillion. This exponential growth in debt is primarily driven by soaring interest costs and persistent deficits that exclude net outlays for interest. Looking closer at the fiscal forecast, debt held by the public is expected to peak in 2029, reaching the highest level ever relative to GDP, before continuing its upward trajectory. This monumental debt will likely slow economic growth, inflate interest payments to foreign debt holders, and present significant risks to both the fiscal and economic outlook of the U.S. It might also limit the flexibility of future lawmakers in their policy-making decisions. Source: Congressional Budget Office Government spending, already high by historical standards, is only expected to rise, reaching 27.3% of GDP by 2054. This increase is driven by growing costs associated with major healthcare programs, particularly Medicare. On the revenue side, despite fluctuations over the next decade, there\u2019s an anticipated increase, with income growth expected to boost receipts from individual income taxes. Economic Adjustments and Insights The U.S. economy\u2019s growth prospects are tempered by slower population growth expected over the next three decades. Without a boost from immigration, the population could even start to decline by 2040. The economy\u2019s growth is also likely hindered by slower labor force growth and subdued capital accumulation, exacerbated by high levels of federal borrowing. Despite a grim long-term outlook, inflation is projected to decelerate, aligning with the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term target of 2% by 2026 and stabilizing thereafter. Interest rates are set to rise, influenced by increasing federal borrowing needs and a growing proportion of capital income relative to total income. These fiscal dynamics reflect adjustments from the CBO\u2019s earlier projections, suggesting a somewhat less dire financial scenario than previously anticipated. This stems from a combination of lower discretionary spending due to legislative caps and an optimistic outlook on immigration boosting the potential labor force.","article_summary":"The economic dance floor has never been more intriguing, with major world powers moving to the rhythms of finance and strategy, directly influencing the global dominance of the U.S. dollar.

Each of these services play a specific role, a role that is very important for advancing the Ethereum ecosystem. Like the AltLayer\u2019s MACH platform. This platform is designed to accelerate the finality of rollups, boasting impressive confirmation speeds of under 10 seconds. Lagrange on the other hand is another pivotal service, that offers light client functionality, which is essential for enabling faster and more secure communication between optimistic rollups and other blockchains. One of the latest launches is Eoracle, the feature-rich Ethereum-native oracle network built on EigenLayer, the first ETH-focused Layer 2 scaling solution. Oracle is a very important link between the data in the real world and smart contracts that make it possible for smart contracts to send commands according to inputs gathered from the external environment. Eoracle will seek to simplify the grievous task using the data to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that they will provide right, reliable, and on time. This growth, apart from ensuring the reliability of decentralized applications, also supports the creation of special transactions that are complex, such as smart blockchain functions and financial tools. In addition, Brevis incorporates \u201ccoprocessors\u201d that ensure the proper purpose of computations on Blockchain, with emphasis on those that do not require storage. Such a service is important for developers who need to make their apps both productive and low-cost that, as a result, makes the technology facilitating the blockchain and its implementation more accessible for as many users as possible. Providing enhanced security via restraking protocol. With a unique identity as the securing asset, EigenLayer\u2019s ground-breaking restacking process empowers users to leverage locked ETH/ETH-backed stablecoins to boost third-party services. The protocol, which offers a robust security system for the Ethereum network, sends the staked assets to support the growth of new services through its capability. The introduction of such services becomes part of a comprehensive work of EigenLayer to solidify its standing as a leader of blockchain innovations. Through the provision of many features having the aim to remedy the current technological and operational problems associated with the Ethereum network, EigenLayer is the precursor of more complicated, safe and usable relating to the blockchain. Conclusion With EigenLayer launching these six frequently validated services, the embracement of peer-to-peer economy and collaborative way of working becomes a clear manifestation in the Ethereum network evolution; providing the necessary thrust to scale and interoperability, thanks to the security being offered by constant validation. As these firms start to build up some traction and want to show that they\u2019re really valued, I think they are bound to earn more developments and investments, especially to come up with more great solutions in the blockchain realm. This feature manifests the fluency of the blockchain technology system and its advanced abilities to deploy continuous solutions with comprehensive approaches. In addition to enhancing its own platform, EigenLayer is also creating something which is very unique in the bigger blockchain ecosystem and in that way is emerging a new era where Ethereum is considerably transforming the world and our online activities.","article_summary":"EigenLayer, better known as a leading company in blockchain technology has announced its launch for six new services.

This change comes hot on the heels of de-dollarization efforts by BRICS countries, and it highlights a growing rift from traditional economic dependences. The yuan now claims more than 42% of total currency exchanges in Russia, overtaking the US dollar, which has fallen to a 39.5% share. The actual trading volume of the yuan has skyrocketed to an impressive $385 billion this year alone. The Rise of Yuan in Global Trade With the backdrop of the BRICS nations pushing forward their agenda to diversify economic interactions away from the US dollar, the impact is visibly significant. This economic shift affects how the global market views the US dollar\u2019s longstanding dominance as the preferred reserve currency. The Moscow Exchange has recorded these shifting trends, with yuan transactions soaring to 34.15 trillion rubles (about $391.5 billion) in 2023, a dramatic increase from the previous year. On the contrary, the dollar\u2019s presence in Moscow\u2019s exchange dipped significantly, dropping from a 63% dominance in previous years to just below 40% this year. As Moscow leans more towards Beijing, amid escalating Western sanctions, this change has seen an increase in Sino-Russian trade, which touched a new peak at $240 billion in 2023, marking a 26.3% increase from the previous year. This surge comes as Russia boosts its import of Chinese goods, ranging from vehicles to smartphones, filling the gap left by departing European and American brands. Yuan Stability Amid Global Fluctuations Even as the dollar experiences fluctuations influenced by U.S. economic policies and global market reactions, China has maintained a relatively stable yuan, an approach aimed at avoiding volatility in its financial markets which can adversely affect local stocks and bonds. The People\u2019s Bank of China has consistently set the yuan\u2019s daily reference rate at levels that prevent drastic fluctuations, recently fixing it at 7.0968 per dollar. This is part of a broader strategy to manage the yuan\u2019s value carefully within a permissible trading range of 2%. The contrast in the two giant economies\u2019 currencies is evident not only in trade figures but also in the broader strategic maneuvers in currency management. While the yuan\u2019s value is carefully curated by Chinese policymakers to foster stability and predictability, the US dollar\u2019s value swings with market sentiments and economic indicators such as inflation rates and Federal Reserve policies. In recent times, the yuan\u2019s stability has become a cornerstone for regional economic confidence, providing a bulwark against potential capital outflows that can destabilize the broader financial markets. This has been particularly critical as the yuan faced pressures that could have tipped it towards undesirable volatility.","article_summary":"The financial tables have turned with the Chinese yuan now leading over the US dollar in trading figures out of Russia, a significant shift in the global currency scene.

TRON Overview Tron Market Statistics TRON Price History As seen on the Tron chart, the price of Tron cryptocurrency has seen a good amount of volatility over the past years. After spending the second half of 2019 retracing from $0.04, TRX eventually found support around the exchange rate of $0.11. This resulted in a push higher at the beginning of 2020 as the price set a new higher high, indicating that a new bull cycle has potentially begun. However, after peaking at $0.026 in the middle of February 2020, the Tron price got heavily rejected to the downside, destroying any bullish price prediction at the time. What followed for the price of crypto was another dump lower. The Tron price pushed through previous support and set a new several-year low at $0.07. The price started to slowly recover from there on, creating a bullish Tron (TRX) price action structure by the end of the year. In September, the Tron price moved and saw a very sharp spike to the upside, resulting in a brief breakout from the significant resistance of $0.04 as it hit a new several-year high of $0.05. During the following weeks, the crypto retraced toward the previous resistance of $0.22-$0.025 and retested it as support. As expected by analysis of several well-known traders at the time, Tron\u2019s price reversed from thereon. After spending the end of 2020 in a consolidation, Tron pushed higher at the beginning of February in a solid bull run, resulting in a $0.065 level being reached, beating several predictions. Source: Tradingview It is in a bearish momentum and has an RSI index of 39. In the 4-hour chart, we can make a short-term Tron price prediction using the above technical analysis. With the reversal in the trend, the coin price has changed its bearish outlook as it is trading above the 50-day and 100-day MA, breaking out of the upper end of the Bollinger Band. Developments affecting the TRX Price The price took a sudden hit of 7% when, on December 17, Justin Sun announced that he had been appointed as Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization, and would be stepping back from TRON. As a result, the TRON Foundation has said it has \u201csettled to dissolve itself on July 25, 2022\u201d. Despite this, the Tron (TRX) price still keeps going up. Could it be that the strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in the DeFine social NFT platform is finally bearing fruits? The funding will be used to develop the first NFT marketplace in the TRON ecosystem and launch auctions soon. Or could it be that the network\u2019s BTFS file storage system (was integrated with DeFine in September? Or TRON\u2019s expansion into the NFT ecosystem with APENFT is operating successfully? Or was some other strategy hatched by Justin Sun? Now, let\u2019s look at the long-term Tron price prediction for the upcoming years and remember that these Tron price predictions are not investment advice. More on the Tron Network What Is Tron (TRX)? Tron (TRX) was created by tech entrepreneur Justin Sun in 2017. The TRON project funds were raised through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with a subscription of funds reaching 70 million. This was one of the largest ICOs and increased cryptocurrency popularity even further. Today, Tron has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies with over $5.4 billion in capitalization, while the 24-hour trading volume exceeds $250 million. At first, TRX ran on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 blockchain as it offered a quick and easy solution for running the peer-to-peer network. Later on, the developers of Tron switched the blockchain to their custom-made solution. The blockchain used proof of stake mining and validation consensus algorithm and was one of the first cryptocurrency projects to implement this solution. One of the primary use cases and benefits of the TRX platform is the support for content creators and artists by providing ownership over the content they create. This is done by storing and tracking the information about created content and its use on the blockchain. Therefore, content creators can directly track how their creations are used and their reward for producing them. The middleman is eliminated, and content creators get paid instantly. TRON Ecosystem Applications Some of the core applications that the TRON ecosystem aims to provide include: Wallet-Cli: Wallet-Cli is the official wallet client provided by the TRON foundation. Further, Wallet-Cli is a command-line version of the wallet that provides essential tools to communicate with the TRON public chain by RPC protocol. RPC protocol stands for remote procedure call, an inter-process communication technique used for point-to-point communication between software applications. Wallet-Cli supports all functions of the TRON public chain in real-time. TronLink: TronLink is a TRON wallet that provides users with a convenient experience, complete functions, and secure funding options. Blockchain Explorer: The first blockchain explorer based on TRON is tronscan.org, which offers essential functions like searching transactions, accounts, blocks, nodes, smart contracts, token creation, and more. DApp: TRON public chain aims to attract a vast community of developers to join in the development, deployment, and running of DApps on the blockchain because of their high performance, low cost, and safety. Tron Foundation The Tron foundation is the governing body of the Tron blockchain. They aim to popularise and further develop the blockchain. Based in Singapore, they ensure that the TRX blockchain is regulated and complies with laws. Tron, Justin Sun, is still the Tron foundation leader and is listed in the Forbes list of 30 under 30 in Asia. In 2018, a popular peer-to-peer torrent-sharing network \u2013 BitTorrent, announced that the TRON Foundation had acquired them to use TRX tokens to incentivize and reward network users. This created massive interest for the token, and it soon exceeded a $1 billion cap. Several other projects and development phases have since been launched, with the most notable ones being the Odyssey, which created a system for incentivizing content creators. Further development phases \u2013 Great Voyage and Apollo-enable content creators to build their brands and issue personalized initial coin offerings to raise funds for their projects. Plans to develop the ecosystem align with Star-Trek and Eternity phases. Star-Trek is set to launch in mid-2023, and Eternity in late 2025. Therefore, we will probably see interest in Tron and blockchain itself grow even further in the upcoming years and increase the price. Let\u2019s look at Tron\u2019s previous price history to understand what the future price could look like. It is a good investment if you rapidly lose money in all others. Tron has been compared with Ethereum due to its lower fees and fast payment. When ETH was at its all-time high, a considerable amount of fees was applicable for transfer, and for this reason, people started shifting to TRON. What other factors affect the TRX price? Tron celebrated the most significant milestones in its existence, surpassing a million active user accounts. But since then, a lot has changed because the total number of active user accounts surpassed 4 million, and it is flourishing. Moving forward, in the first week of June 2021, there have been more than 10 million transactions recorded on the Tron blockchain. On June 14, it recorded a total of 1,049,206 transactions. That is almost triple the number of transactions recorded daily on the Bitcoin blockchain. Factors affecting Tron\u2019s price are the same as any other cryptocurrency \u2013 mainly, the supply and demand on cryptocurrency exchanges. More significant deals are often done off the exchanges, creating a negligible impact on the Tron price. Supply and Demand The coin supply naturally comes from the number of tokens released into the market every day. In the case of Tron, you can earn a mining reward by staking the coin. As of now, staking TRX offers around a 7 percent annual yield. However, this yield will vary over time and based on market conditions. On the other hand, the demand for Tron comes from investors who want to buy it with the expectation that its long-term value will grow. Another motivation for purchasing Tron is the ability to stake your coins, giving you an annual yield. Staking TRX tokens also gives the power to vote on various issues that the network developers want to solve or features that they want to add. Therefore, by purchasing and staking TRX, you help ensure the TRX blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism. Regulatory Compliance Recently rumors of the United States and China investigating the TRON Foundation and the blockchain itself. In his Twitter account, the founder of Tron Network, Justin Sun, ensured no reasons to doubt the accusations of malpractice as the network is run as a decentralized network. Therefore, claims of centralized manipulation are of no sense since the TRON Foundation is only one of several thousands of participants. Overall, TRX is compliant with various global regulations as any other major blockchain. This ensures the demand for TRX continues growing. Therefore, over time, the crypto market price should continue to rise over the next five years. The Rise of DApps Over the last months, the TRX network experienced an increased interest in decentralized applications (DApps). As of now, more than 100 DApps are running on the blockchain, offering various categories of functionality ranging from exchanges to gaming and gambling. Websites such as DappRadar offer a quick overview of the most popular ones and how many users have each decentralized application attracted over time. User count ranges from several hundred to several thousand, and this number is expected to grow further over the next 5-year period. This raised interest in the TRX blockchain functionality, which created an additional appeal to invest in Tron. Therefore, creating extra trading volume and market growth for the cryptocurrency market. Where to buy Tron? Tron is available for trading on practically every major exchange, just like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is one of the best-known cryptocurrencies, with a high average trading volume of more than $2 billion per day. As seen during previous bull markets of cryptocurrencies, this number is likely to grow over the next five years. Therefore purchasing crypto shouldn\u2019t be an issue for anyone interested in trading or investing. How to store Tron? Tron offers several options for storing crypto. The basic one is the so-called TRON paper wallet, which involves a primary method of printing out your private keys and keeping them on a piece of paper in a place to which only you have access. This basic solution comes from earlier cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Other options include Tron Android wallet, Tron IOS wallet, Chrome wallet, Exodus desktop wallet, and the commonly used hardware wallets of Ledger Nano and Trezor. This means that the Tron coin can be stored in as many different wallet options as other well-established cryptos, such as Ethereum. TRON DAO introduced a development fund to support blockchain projects focused on AI. With AI technology gaining increased attention and experiencing growth, especially within the cryptocurrency sector, TRON DAO seeks to expedite this trend through its latest $100 million fund. It is anticipated that TRON will soon position itself at the top list of dominating the payment sector, significantly pushing TRX\u2019s price to the North. Not long ago, TRON\u2019s stablecoin USDD depegged from $1 and traded at $0.97, which built up a strong negative sentiment in the TRON community with an extended bearish consolidation ahead in the TRX price graph. However, the development team seems promising as it looks for several ways to revive the ecosystem with great enhancements to the network. It is advised to do your own research and conduct good investment advice before investing in the highly volatile market. TRON has evolved the blockchain space to a new era as it focuses on developing the foundation of a decentralized global ecosystem, which is a crucial sector of the crypto space. TRON coin is a highly-rated cryptocurrency with massive potential for widespread adoption in the future. Much of these expectations are due to the strategic partnerships continuously secured by the TRON ecosystem in a bid to promote awareness of the platform. An example of such partnerships is the recent collaboration with the Republic of Dominica, in which the TRON platform will be used to create fan tokens known as Dominica Coins (DMC), which serve to promote the country\u2019s national and cultural heritage. The Tron ecosystem is rapidly growing with new users and dApps. This results from the robustness, scalability, and low cost of the blockchain. As we transition into WEB 3, we anticipate new industry players to plug into the Tron blockchain, like Samsung. Furthermore, the TRON network continues to attract numerous developers and users with its high throughput and low transaction fees. On the first of September, Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, announced the network had hit a new milestone, recording a total transfer value of over $5 trillion since its launch in 2018. Tron has weathered its investors from this year\u2019s crypto winter, and due to its high utility, it will be highly profitable in the following market bull run. The shaky performance of Tron USDD stablecoin will adversely affect Tron\u2019s performance in the case of a crash. Many Tron opponents and Ethereum proponents have long believed that Tron is not legitimate crypto. They have speculated on the legitimacy of Tron as a company in general after Tron openly admitted that it is going after Ethereum. ETH is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. However, crypto enthusiasts think that the two projects cannot be compared. They are different since the ETH developers wrote their code from scratch, while Tron might have copied and improved the code. Nonetheless, Sun said that the Tron blockchain code was written from scratch and originally in Chinese, the main thing going for TRX. TRON may soon make a bullish reversal as the developing team is actively looking for valuable opportunities to bring to the TRX platform. If the demand for TRX stays stable or increases, and supply remains constant, TRON crypto may see a price increase in the future. With the Tron Foundation out of the way, TRX will be one of the most decentralized cryptos and can shoot up to a high of $3.05 with an average forecast price of $2.56 by 2032. You have to trade and hold TRX for a long time before getting rich due to its volatility. Most TRON price predictions consider TRX a favorable asset for long-term investment, capable of delivering steady profits over the years. The future prices of TRON will majorly depend on the crypto market\u2019s favorability to make it a good investment option. That said, these price predictions are not guaranteed, as various factors can influence cryptocurrency market prices. Thus, investors are advised to consult with financial market experts before making investment decisions. By reading your favorite coins\u2019 price analysis and daily roundups, you may keep yourself updated and better able to make a decision.","article_summary":"Tron Price Prediction 2024-2033 TRX, or rather Tronix, is the native crypto asset of the TRON Network.

The more attention it garners, the more it appears to falter. Yet, despite the turmoil, significant voices in the finance sector argue that now might just be the perfect time to invest in UK stocks. This suggestion is timely, especially considering the performance metrics and economic dynamics currently at play. Barclays and Goldman Sachs, two giants of finance, have been vocal about the potential lurking in the undervalued corridors of the UK stock market. As economic indicators flicker between positive and ominous, these institutions see a silver lining ready for savvy investors to explore. The Argument for Investment Barclays points out that while the UK may not be a hotspot for tech giants, which has been a drawback, the broader market is gaining momentum. The UK market, rich in commodities and defensive stocks, might just prove resilient in the face of global economic fluctuations. Moreover, with the Bank of England taking a bold approach to interest rates, compared to a more cautious Federal Reserve, there\u2019s potential for the pound to stabilize, adding more attractiveness to UK stocks. On the valuation front, the UK\u2019s equities are trading at appealing multiples. The FTSE 100, a composite of the UK\u2019s top 100 companies, is showing signs of underpricing compared to its historical performance. Goldman Sachs has gone so far as to declare this one of the best entry points for the UK market in recent history, especially relative to global counterparts. Brexit and Beyond Then there\u2019s the Brexit angle. The departure from the EU has certainly left its mark on the UK\u2019s economy, but recent political developments suggest a potential thawing in relations with the EU. With new government frameworks aiming to foster closer ties with the continent, the prolonged Brexit anxiety might start to diminish, providing a boost to investor confidence. The UK\u2019s stock market also benefits from regulatory reforms and fiscal incentives aimed at making it more attractive for both domestic and international investors. Noteworthy is the introduction of savings reforms which might bolster the market by enhancing the domestic bid for UK equities. Yet, for all the optimistic projections, the UK market remains haunted by its less appealing performance in sectors like IPOs. The London Stock Exchange saw a dismal year with only a minimal amount raised through public offerings. Major companies and exciting startups seem to prefer listing elsewhere, drawn by more favorable market conditions or regulatory environments. This exodus poses a serious question about the long-term attractiveness and competitiveness of the UK as a financial hub. Compounding this is the dwindling interest from the pension sector, historically a significant player in UK equities. As pension funds diversify their portfolios away from the UK, the domestic slice of the market shrinks, adding to the liquidity concerns and the broader negative perception regarding the UK\u2019s financial markets. Despite these challenges, the UK stock market is not without its defenders who point to sectors and conditions ripe for investment. The current valuation levels, the potential for regulatory and fiscal enhancements, and a more stable geopolitical scene post-Brexit adjustments present a mixed bag of risks and opportunities.","article_summary":"The UK stock market, it seems, is a creature of contradiction.

Despite some superficial similarities in market trends, such as interest rates, the core dynamics diverge sharply. Differing Directions in Monetary Policy Recent shifts in financial forecasts have brought a surprising expectation: the Bank of England might lower rates sooner and by more than the Federal Reserve. This twist comes after U.S. inflation rates in March hinted at more aggressive monetary cooling than anticipated. Yet, the persistence of inflation in the UK suggests that rate cuts might need to be postponed rather than accelerated. The UK faces unique challenges, with significant supply-side constraints that dampen its economic outlook. The Monetary Policy Committee pegs this year\u2019s potential growth at a modest 1%, with a slight rise to 1.3% by 2026. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office projects a potential growth of 2.2% during the same period, highlighting a strong capacity to handle economic demand without tipping into inflation. The Investment and Labor Supply Gap The disparity extends into crucial economic areas like labor supply and business investment. In the UK, labor market participation hasn\u2019t bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, and business investment has been tepid since the Brexit vote in 2016. On the other side of the pond, the U.S. boasts a vigorous return in workforce participation and has seen a surge in business investments, outpacing other advanced economies since 2016. This includes significant investments in strategic sectors like green technology and semiconductors, propelled by recent legislative acts like the Inflation Reduction and CHIPS Acts. The stronger U.S. consumer market also fuels demand which, coupled with government spending, places the U.S. in a favorable position to manage inflationary pressures. In contrast, the UK struggles with weaker supply and demand, making it more susceptible to inflation, especially given the lingering effects of global challenges such as the pandemic and geopolitical tensions in Europe. The impact of the Ukrainian conflict on energy costs exemplifies these differences, with the UK feeling a sharper sting than its American counterpart. This divergence in economic shock absorption capacity has led to a UK market that\u2019s more reactive to past inflation, potentially prolonging the inflationary environment as businesses and households adjust to elevated costs. The sticky wage growth in the UK, which is higher than in the U.S., further complicates the inflation outlook. While U.S. wage growth remains more aligned with inflation, the UK sees wage-driven cost pressures that continue to push service inflation beyond desirable levels. Sterling\u2019s journey also tells a tale of its own. Despite a lengthy period of underperformance, there are signs of impending appreciation. The UK\u2019s inflation is on a downtrend, and real interest rates are tilting towards the positive. This scenario, combined with a favorable global economic outlook, suggests potential strength for the pound, especially as the Bank of England gears up for a cautious rate-cutting cycle later this year. Moreover, the UK\u2019s chronic current account deficit shows signs of narrowing, which could further support the currency. The upcoming general election, anticipated to tilt in favor of a pro-business Labour majority, might also bolster confidence in the pound.

Despite narrowly sidestepping the dread of a full-blown recession, the forecast isn\u2019t exactly rosy. We\u2019re staring down the barrel of a decade where historical growth rates feel like distant memories. A Persistent Struggle for Growth Our economy has been anything but forgiving since the 2008-09 financial crash, with global growth consistently dragging its feet. The latest data projects an even sadder scenario. Growth limping to just above 3% by 2029. This is nearly a whole percentage point under what we saw before the pandemic wreaked havoc. The implications are grave, threatening to roll back the progress in living standards we\u2019ve made, particularly hitting hard where the discrepancy between rich and poor countries continues to widen. The sluggish growth is tethered to persistently high interest rates, which may well jeopardize debt sustainability. This, in turn, shackles governments\u2019 ability to respond to economic downturns and fund social or environmental ventures. A chilling expectation of weak growth might also keep investors from putting money into crucial areas like technology and capital, potentially exacerbating the economic slowdown. And let\u2019s not overlook the main problem. Geopolitical tensions and trade policies that could fragment the global market even further. Yet, there\u2019s a silver lining, albeit a slim one. Implementing a variety of policies aimed at better distribution of labor and capital and addressing labor shortages due to aging populations in key economies could ignite some sparks of growth in the medium term. It\u2019s about making labor and capital more productive, moving resources to where they can be used best. Tackling Challenges Head-On In our ongoing struggle, demographic shifts and weak business investment are also putting the brakes on growth. With the aging populations in key economies, there\u2019s an imminent squeeze on labor growth, while capital formation continues to lag due to tepid investment levels. Addressing these issues might seem daunting, but the potential remedies could stimulate notable improvements. Enhanced labor supply and better resource distribution, while moderate in their individual impact, collectively offer a beacon of hope. By adopting policies that increase trade openness, improve labor market flexibility, and boost financial development, we might just see global growth lifted by about 1.2 percentage points by the end of this decade. The adoption and integration of artificial intelligence also hold a promising, though uncertain, potential to amplify labor productivity significantly. Remember, technological breakthroughs aren\u2019t coming as easily as they once did. There\u2019s a palpable stagnation in educational advancements, and the gap between developing and developed economies isn\u2019t narrowing fast enough. Without some major technological and structural reforms, we\u2019re potentially looking at a global economic growth of just 2.8% by 2030\u2014well below the 3.8% historical average. Kristalina Georgieva described the upcoming decade as \u201ctepid\u201d at best, amidst a backdrop of economic challenges that include still-rampant inflation, depleted fiscal buffers, and soaring public debt. This sets a rather grim stage as we face a record number of elections and an era marked by unprecedented uncertainty and years of economic shocks. With her term ending soon, and a reelection seemingly on the cards, the next set of projections for the global economy, expected next week, could provide a crucial update to the narrative. There\u2019s no room for complacency. The staggering estimated $3.3 trillion in lost output since the coronavirus pandemic began has dealt the harshest blows to the most vulnerable nations. It\u2019s clear that if significant policy changes aren\u2019t made, particularly around productivity and debt management, this decade could very well be one of the most challenging we have faced globally in modern times.","article_summary":"The managing director of the International Monetary Fund has sounded a stern warning about the trajectory of the global economy, predicting a scenario of subdued growth and rising public unrest over the next ten years.

If you manage a large pool of Bitcoin and you take fees for doing so, then why would you not reinvest some of that into the underlying infrastructure?\u201d For this reason, Bitwise, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (ticker: BITB), committed to donating 10% of its ETF fee profits to three different nonprofits that fund Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 OpenSats, Brink and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) \u2014 for 10 years. \u201cBrink, OpenSats and HRF were the most established nonprofits with a track record of funding Bitcoin devs \u2014 they had the proof of work, so to speak,\u201d Kim told Bitcoin Magazine. VanEck, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name VanEck Bitcoin Trust (ticker: HODL), also sees the value in supporting Bitcoin Core developers. Hence, it promised to contribute 5% of HODL profits to Brink and it made an initial $10,000 donation to the organization. \u201cWe believe TradFi stands to gain from the efforts of Bitcoin's Core contributors,\u201d Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAs we stand to profit from Bitcoin\u2019s price increase, it makes sense that we also give back to the work of the innovators who make the chain possible,\u201d he added. Given that it\u2019s only sensible for spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to give back Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 those who support and further the underlying asset for their financial product \u2014 which will be next to follow Bitwise and VanEck\u2019s lead? The development of Bitcoin and open-source scaling solutions for the protocol could benefit significantly from more of these major financial institutions donating even a small portion of the profits from their spot Bitcoin ETF fees.","article_summary":"Currently, less than 20% of the financial institutions that issued spot Bitcoin ETFs give back to Bitcoin Core developers.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-support-btc-developers-bitwise-and-vaneck","_id":{"date":"Sat Apr 13 07:43:23 ICT 2024","timestamp":1712969003},"creation_date":"2024-04-13T02:22:26Z","type":"article","category":["Vaneck","Business","Bitwise","Developers","News","Spot Bitcoin Etf","Bitcoin core"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-support-btc-developers-bitwise-and-vaneck","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3NzYxMzkzMTI1MDE1/educating-the-next-wave-of-bitcoin-developers.jpg"},{"article_title":"6 Common Pitfalls of Self-Directed and Checkbook Bitcoin IRAs","author":"Jessy Gilger","article_detailed_content":"Originally published on Unchained.com.

You don\u2019t often see the term \u201cRoth IRA\u201d trending online, but in 2021, tech investor Peter Thiel made headlines for his $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA piggy bank. How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny. \u201cThiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.\u201d \u2013 ProPublica (2021) Let\u2019s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures. The different IRA structures The different IRA structures can behave in an \u201cevery square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares\u201d kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA. Brokerage and Bank IRAs Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The Unchained IRA is closest to this structure in this hierarchy. Self-directed IRA (SDIRA) A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn\u2019t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that are not allowed (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.). Checkbook IRA Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (\u201ccheckbook control\u201d). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA. Non-checkbook self-directed IRA A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA 1. Liquidity Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy. 2. Formation and legal structure When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account. With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA. 3. Misreporting transactions Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions. At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit fair market valuation (FMV) information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law. 4. \u201cDeemed distribution\u201d treatment Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of \u201cdeemed distributions\u201d treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC\u2019s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the LLC\u2019s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA. It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying \u201cdeemed distribution\u201d treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to IRS Publication 590, it\u2019s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. Read more about the McNulty case and its implications. 5. Prohibited transactions All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. \u201cSelf-dealing\u201d is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself\u2014not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide \u201csweat equity.\u201d It\u2019s not only the IRA owner that can\u2019t participate in any \u201cself-dealing,\u201d but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and penalties are stiff. These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don\u2019t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the IRS list of prohibited transactions here. Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors: Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets Leverage without a non-recourse loan Investing in certain collectible NFTs1 6. Financing Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons: Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases. Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits. IRA-owned active businesses could run into the issue of UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin mining within an IRA. Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA\u2019s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs. What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs? The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls. Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA If you\u2019re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It\u2019s not a \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations. There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it\u2019ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time \u2013 adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope \u2013 ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it\u2019s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the experience of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal\u2019s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0 is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions \u2013 but don\u2019t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network \u2013 we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we do broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork \u2013 presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we\u2019ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can\u2019t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) \u201cLayer Connector\u201d that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs! With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes) A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per \u201clayer\u201d (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.) The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the \u201cDispatcher\u201d. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn\u2019t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can\u2019t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the \u201cparent\u201d. In order for miners to capture the fees from this \u201cchild\u201d transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10\u2019s or 100\u2019s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we\u2019d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would: look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the \u201csplit\u201d transaction here: https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb. The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn\u2019t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas. Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. There are other aspects of the project that we haven\u2019t covered here \u2013 how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one\u2019s easy: it\u2019s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. This is a guest post by Rijndael.

Cipher Mining and Stronghold Digital Mining also announced expansions in January. The halving will reduce mining rewards per block. Not accounting for possible fluctuations in BTC prices, lower rewards will likely reduce profitability for some mining companies. However, lower profits can potentially be offset by more efficient operations.

Ficco said the IRS has seen an increase in \u201cpure crypto tax crimes\u201d that fall under Title 26 of the US Code, which includes federal income tax violations. Crimes considered pure tax crimes involve failing to report income from crypto sales and hiding or shielding one\u2019s actual basis in crypto. The issue will likely persist. Ficco observed an \u201cuptick\u201d in tax-reporting crimes and expects the IRS to bring forward more charges this year and in the future. Until recently, IRS investigations have primarily been a part of broader investigations into crypto crimes such as scams and embezzlement. Ficco acknowledged that crypto is \u201cbecoming more pervasive\u201d and will \u201cmaintain or probably have a larger part\u201d in broader crimes such as phone scams, romance scams, and pig butchering. Crypto scams are distinct from tax-reporting crimes. Reporting failures widespread Ficco\u2019s comments come after the IRS published a reminder that individuals must report taxes if they sold crypto, received crypto as payment, or engaged in other crypto transactions. The IRS has included some form of tax reporting rules for crypto investors since at least 2014, but past reports suggest that reporting failures remain high. A 2023 report from Divly found that in the US, just 1.62% of investors paid taxes on crypto as required. The US rate is only slightly above the global average of 0.53%. IRS enforcement efforts around crypto could become especially strong starting this year. In February, the agency hired two experts to focus on crypto, and past reports from CNBC suggest that tax professionals are preparing for a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of scrutiny. Ficco\u2019s predecessor, Jim Lee, also suggested an increased focus on tax issues in December 2023. Lee said half of 2023\u2019s then-active crypto investigations involved tax issues.

JP Morgan and Bitcoin investment management firm NYDIG anticipated that spot Bitcoin ETFs could achieve an AUM of $36 billion and $30 billion by the year\u2019s end. Meanwhile, Matrixport predicted the ETF would garner an AUM between $24 billion and $50 billion by Dec. 31, 2024. The actual AUM is nearly twice as high as each company\u2019s earlier prediction, and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the way to meet the more optimistic predictions made by CryptoQuant, Standard Chartered, and Bloomberg Intelligence. Bloomberg and Standard Chartered project an end-of-year AUM of roughly $100 billion for the ETFs, while CryptoQuant believes they will reach $150 billion. The data includes Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, which accounts for $22.26 billion of the collective AUM and has mostly seen outflows since its launch. Other key ETF data Bitwise\u2019s report also revealed that spot Bitcoin ETF demand far exceeded new BTC production during the first quarter of 2024. Miners produced 74,756 BTC during the first quarter, while the ETFs collectively took in 212,852 BTC \u2014 2.8x higher than the amount produced. The report said that the reduction in mining output caused by Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving \u2014 expected roughly around April 20 \u2014 could affect the supply-demand ratio. Bitcoin ETFs also demonstrated strong performance against the two largest US gold ETFs. During the first quarter, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $12 billion in inflows against $3 billion in gold ETF outflows. Despite their broader success, Bitcoin ETFs represent only a minority of Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin ETFs hold 800,000 BTC, amounting to 3.9% of all Bitcoin ownership. Individuals (57%), inactive accounts (17.6%), and several other small categories hold the remainder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin findings The Bitwise report also noted that Bitcoin had demonstrated high performance year-to-date, with its value rising 66.99% year-to-date \u2014 outperforming growth in almost every market, including the US equities (10.56%), gold (8.09%), DM equities (5.81%), and other markets. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan also noted \u201clow correlations between Bitcoin and the S&P 500,\u201d represented in the report by a 0.11 correlation between Bitcoin and the US equities market. The correlation is critical, as the degree to which Bitcoin correlates with traditional markets determines whether Bitcoin is a risk-on asset or a hedge against conventional markets. Hougan said Bitwise\u2019s report should provoke a \u201cstaggeringly bullish\u201d attitude toward the crypto market.

The decline mirrored a broader selloff across asset classes amid heightened global economic uncertainties and geopolitical risks. Bitcoin has slightly recovered since the violent drawdown, trading at around $67,300 as of press time, based on CryptoSlate data. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, fell 12% to $3,100 before paring some losses to close 8% lower at $3244 as of press time.

Both tokens were down roughly 12% over the past 24 hours as of press time \u2014 trading at $593 and $153, respectively. Smaller cryptocurrencies faced even steeper declines, with tokens like Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recording losses ranging from 15% to 20%. The crypto market\u2019s downturn triggered one of the largest leverage washouts of the month, erasing approximately $850 million in leveraged derivatives positions, with CoinGlass data indicating that $770 million of these were long positions expecting price increases.

The sentencing marks the first time someone has been convicted for hacking a smart contract. US attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cNo matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today\u2019s sentence shows, time in prison \u2014 and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto \u2014 is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks.\u201d Ahmed was also ordered to forfeit approximately $12.3 million and a significant quantity of crypto and pay over $5 million in restitution to the unnamed crypto exchange and Nirvana. The hacks In 2022, Ahmed hacked the smart contracts of two decentralized crypto exchanges, including Nirvana and an unnamed protocol, for a substantial amount of a digital asset. The DOJ said Ahmed manipulated pricing data on the unnamed platform to siphon approximately $9 million in inflated fees and withdrew the funds in crypto. Subsequently, Ahmed agreed to return around $7.5 million under the condition that the exchange refrains from involving law enforcement. Shortly after, Ahmed targeted Nirvana Finance, stealing about $3.6 million. According to the DOJ, Ahmed exploited Nirvana\u2019s smart contracts to purchase crypto at lower prices from the exchange and sold it at higher prices. Despite the exchange offering a $600,000 bounty, Ahmed demanded $1.4 million, leading to a stalemate and the retention of all stolen funds, culminating in the exchange\u2019s closure. Subsequently, Ahmed laundered the stolen digital assets using sophisticated techniques such as token-swap transactions and advanced crypto mixers like Samourai Whirlpool.

Anza, a spinoff of Solana Labs, spearheaded the development with the release of version 1.18.11 aimed at mitigating network congestion. Validator clients, essential in proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana, verify transactions to ensure compliance with network rules and confirm the sender\u2019s fund sufficiency before appending new blocks to the blockchain. Recently, spam transactions have significantly slowed processing times and increased transaction drop rates on Solana, which uniquely processes transactions directly without a mempool, adding complexity to its congestion issues. Anza initially deployed the updated software version 1.18.11 on a devnet, and they are now calling for testnet validators to test the effectiveness of these fixes. Anza tweeted on April 12: \u201cThe v1.18.11 release is now deployed to devnet, recommended for use on testnet. Please upgrade ASAP to help us start analyzing the effects of the proposed congestion fixes.\u201d In response to the congestion, Solana developers are also exploring strategies to enhance network efficiency. These include optimizing computing unit usage, implementing priority fees to improve user experiences, and developing a stake-weighted Quality-of-Service (QoS) system to prioritize transactions more efficiently. External analyses have highlighted the negative impact of congestion on Solana\u2019s operational performance. The network serves as a significant hub for DeFi activities, which has escalated the congestion problem with increased demand, leading to record-high trading volumes on decentralized exchanges in March. Austin Federa, Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, recently addressed the root causes of these issues in a tweet: \u201cThe issues stem from an implementation of the QUIC protocol and can be attributed to a known issue that suddenly got much worse due to unprecedented demand.\u201d Teams from Anza, Firedancer, Jito, and other core contributors are actively working to strengthen Solana\u2019s networking stack in response to this demand. Federa remains optimistic about overcoming these challenges, drawing parallels to similar obstacles the network faced in early 2022.

EIP 3074 EIP 3074 is a pivotal advancement within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and was introduced by Lightclients in 2020. The proposal has garnered widespread support from the crypto community as it aims to enhance the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets. Fundamentally, EIP 3074 enables conventional crypto wallets like MetaMask to function akin to smart contracts. This upgrade facilitates various functionalities, including transaction bundling, streamlining the signing process to a single step, and sponsored transactions. The latter feature empowers wallets to delegate funds for others to utilize, offering a more versatile and efficient transaction framework. Trading a new token on a DEX such as Uniswap will now only require one signature from a user\u2019s wallet as opposed to having to approve the new token and then sign the transaction to purchase. Crypto community reacts The announcement of the impending upgrade has sparked various reactions within the crypto community. Georgios Konstantopoulous, Paradigm\u2019s CTO, highlighted the update\u2019s potential to enhance wallet usability tenfold, noting Reth\u2019s successful implementation and testing. Echoing this sentiment, Hayden Adams, the mind behind Uniswap, lauded the upgrade as a significant boost to Ethereum\u2019s user experience. He added: \u201cIndustry should make an effort to create compatibility for 4337 wallets to interact with 3074 contracts (much like eip1271 has created compatibility between safes and EOAs today).\u201d However, EVM developer Alex Watts cautioned against solely focusing on user experience improvements, emphasizing the broader implications for application and mechanism design. Despite the optimism, concerns linger among some community members regarding the EIP 3074 upgrade. Ansgar Dietrich, an Ethereum Researcher involved in the proposal\u2019s inception, expressed ambivalence, reflecting on the lengthy journey to its impending mainnet integration and questioning its alignment with the evolving account abstraction roadmap.

In a recent episode of the SlateCast podcast, CryptoSlate\u2019s Liam \u201cAkiba\u201d Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Joonatan Lintala, the CEO of the web3 social app Phaver, to explore how this new paradigm is empowering creators and communities. The Meme Coin Conundrum The discussion started with a dive into the controversial world of meme coins. Akiba, a self-proclaimed critic of memecoins, argued that they often \u201churt adoption\u201d and represent \u201cgambling\u201d rather than genuine value creation. However, he acknowledged that Lens memecoins, such as Bonsai and Degen, behave differently, potentially driving the adoption of decentralized social platforms. Lintala shared a similar perspective, noting the \u201ccasino and the computer\u201d dichotomy in blockchain, where speculation can overshadow the development of real-world solutions. He explained: \u201cIf the meme coins, in this case, the social meme coins especially, are the ones that are actually driving adoption of those computer side solutions, such as decentralized social and web free social, then obviously they can be a net positive.\u201d Favor\u2019s Approach to Tokens Lintala delved into Phaver\u2019s approach to building an in-app economy, emphasizing the importance of being \u201cfarming resistant\u201d and incorporating advertising partners. He highlighted the lessons learned from the Lens ecosystem, where airdrops to bots and multi-account users have diluted the value of some meme coin distributions. Lintala explained: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that\u2019s going to be kind of even more of an adoption driver. But at the same time, it\u2019s been very bullish to see how well Bonsai is doing on the Lens side. And of course Degen on the Farcaster side has been an even much bigger success and very much driving the adoption of Farcaster, despite being a third party meme coin on top of Warpcast right now.\u201d Building Partnerships and Community A key aspect of Phaver\u2019s strategy is building mutually beneficial partnerships with high-quality web3 projects and local communities. Lintala highlighted the importance of these collaborations, stating: \u201cBy far the biggest value you can bring in growth is if you build mutually beneficial partnerships with high-quality people or projects.\u201d This approach has allowed Phaver to create a thriving ecosystem, with creators from diverse backgrounds and locations finding a home on the platform. Lintala noted: \u201cWe have a lot of really amazing content. Female creators, whether they are creating art or music or just in general sheet posting.\u201d The Holistic Web3 Social Experience Phaver\u2019s vision extends beyond just social media functionality, as the platform aims to provide a seamless and accessible experience for users to engage with various web3 features.

Lintala shared: \u201cWe want to include both Forecaster Frames and Lens Open Actions. Besides Lens collecting alone, we see that while collecting posts does have an amount of potential in itself, but I think there\u2019s even more potential in the general collectibles minting of, if you\u2019re an artist you can make kind of an actual NFT instead of a Lens post NFT out of an artwork and allow people to meet that if you\u2019re a musician, you can sell your fantasies directly in frames or open actions, all of that, I think will have even bigger potential than just the collecting alone.\u201d The Future of Web3 Social As the web3 social landscape continues to gain adoption, Phaver\u2019s focus on building a mainstream-friendly, farming-resistant platform that empowers creators and communities across the globe stands out.

Nervos Network, along with its native token CKB, has not only recorded significant gains but has also climbed to the 79th rank in the market, raising questions about the factors behind its surge. Nervos Network Decoded Nervos Network is a proof-of-work (PoW) Layer 1 (L1) blockchain designed to optimize application-specific Layer 2 chains. The network aims to establish its native asset, CKB, as a more sustainable store of value (SoV) compared to Bitcoin (BTC) while providing a more secure smart contract platform than Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply and decreasing block rewards raise concerns about long-term economic incentives for miners. Notably, the Nervos Network tackles this issue by introducing a fixed annual secondary issuance of CKBs and the base supply, providing long-term incentives for miners. Nervos Network also addresses the potential security risk associated with Ethereum. In Ethereum, the value of its native asset, ETH, is not directly linked to the value of Layer 2 apps built on top of it. Nervos Network aims to mitigate this risk by ensuring that CKB is used for transaction fees and storage, creating a stronger economic relationship between the native asset and the overall network. How Secondary Issuance And State Rent Drive Sustainability Nervos utilizes a perpetual secondary issuance model to increase CKB\u2019s SoV properties. This model incentivizes users to continuously lock up CKB in proportion to the size of their applications. Furthermore, locked CKBs are subject to \u201cstate rent\u201d through inflation, which automates state rent payments and ensures a sustainable economic model. Nervos Network introduces a secondary market for chain space, enabling apps to unlock and sell CKBs without requiring relevant storage. Investors can offset inflation by purchasing CKBs and depositing them into NervosDAO, a mechanism that receives a portion of the secondary issuance to counterbalance inflation. Interestingly, this resembles \u201ctreasury bonds\u201d and offers potential investment opportunities. Approaching ATH Amidst Bitcoin Integration Announcement Having delved into the fundamentals, CKB has recently experienced a significant surge in value, breaking out of a long consolidation phase that lasted almost two years. After trading in a range of $0.0024 to $0.0035, the cryptocurrency has broken through this price level since January 30th and has seen significant gains over the past few months. Currently trading at $0.032, CKB is close to its all-time high (ATH) of $0.043, which was reached in March 2021. The token has seen notable price increases of 47%, 69%, 75%, and 14% over the past fourteen days, seven days, and 24 hours, respectively. According to CoinGecko data, CKB has also seen a significant increase in trading volume, reaching $207 million in the last 24 hours, 9.7% from the previous day\u2019s trading. In addition, CKB\u2019s market capitalization has increased significantly, nearly doubling from $740 million on April 2 to approximately $1.35 billion in just over a week. The price spike can be attributed to the announcement that Nervos Network\u2019s CKB token will join the Bitcoin network. The token\u2019s introduction of smart contract functionality, along with its interoperability and modularity features scheduled for 2024, has created excitement among investors. As Bitcoin approaches the Halving that has historically increased its value, Nervos Network is well-positioned to benefit from its strong ties to the largest cryptocurrency in the market. With its continued bullish momentum and the predicted increase in BTC\u2019s price, CKB may be poised to reach new all-time highs soon.

Analyst Thinks So","author":"Keshav Verma","article_detailed_content":"An analyst has explained how a PEPE daily close outside of a certain price range could lead its value to go on a rally of 54%. PEPE Symmetrical Triangle May Hint At The Next Move For The Memecoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the recent trend forming in the PEPE price. According to the analyst, the memecoin is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on its one-day chart. The \u201csymmetrical triangle\u201d here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle. In this pattern, there are two lines of interest between which the asset\u2019s price consolidates for a period. The upper line connects successive tops, while the lower one joins together bottoms. The main feature of the pattern is that these two lines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope (hence the \u201csymmetrical\u201d in the name). There are other triangle patterns in TA, but those have either differently angled lines (as is the case with wedges) or one line parallel to the time-axis (ascending and descending triangles). Like other TA patterns that represent a consolidation phase, the lines of the symmetrical triangle also serve as a point of potential reversal for the price. The upper line usually offers resistance (meaning tops can occur), while the lower line may provide support (bottom formation). When a break takes place from either of these lines, the price may likely see sustained momentum in that direction. This implies that a break above the triangle could be a bullish signal, while one below may be bearish. The symmetrical triangle may be viewed as a phase of the market in which the bulls and bears are at a standstill, hence why the price is ranging sideways. During a break, one of these wins out, and price action follows in that direction. Naturally, as the lines converge towards a center point in this pattern, a breakout becomes increasingly probable the closer to the apex of the triangle the asset\u2019s price gets. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that highlights the symmetrical triangle pattern that PEPE has been trading inside recently: As is visible in the graph, the 1-day price of PEPE has been approaching the triangle\u2019s apex recently, implying that a break in a direction may be coming for the memecoin. \u201cWatch out for a daily close outside of the $0.00000793 \u2013 $0.00000664 range, which could lead to a 54% move for PEPE,\u201d explains the analyst. Given the pattern that has been forming, it now remains to be seen how the asset\u2019s price will play out from here. PEPE Price At the time of writing, PEPE is trading around $0.000006868072, up 3% over the past week.","article_summary":"An analyst has explained how a PEPE daily close outside of a certain price range could lead its value to go on a rally of 54%.

Analytics Platform Reveals What You Should Expect","author":"Scott Matherson","article_detailed_content":"Hannah Phung, a lead analyst at on-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain, recently gave her opinion on the impact that Bitcoin Halving could have on the flaghsip crypto\u2019s price. This adds to the ongoing debate on whether or not the Halving event could cause Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise to $100,000. Bitcoin\u2019s Price Surge Might Not Come Immediately Phung mentioned during an interview with BeInCrypto that Bitcoin\u2019s price tends to increase around 6 to 12 months after the Halving and not immediately. This is evident from the past Halving events, as Bitcoin\u2019s significant price gains came about one year after the Halving had occurred. After the first Halving on November 28, 2021, Bitcoin saw a price increase of over 8,000% one year after the event. Meanwhile, BTC saw a price increase of 284% and 559% one year after the second and third Halving events, which took place on July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020, respectively. Phung further noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price gains come from the reduction in Bitcoin miners\u2019 supply, which helps increase scarcity and drive up its price, especially when demand is stable. In February, NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin\u2019s demand was far outpacing the miners\u2019 supply. This led to several crypto analysts making bullish predictions that Bitcoin\u2019s price could increase exponentially when miners\u2019 rewards are further cut in half later this month. One such analyst was MacronautBTC, who raised the possibility of Bitcoin rising to $237,000. This Bitcoin Halving Could Be Different Despite the crypto market being known to follow historical patterns, Phung emphasized that the market can also be unpredictable, opening the possibility of this Halving being different from past ones. Moreover, this cycle has already proven different, considering that for the first time, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving. Furthermore, the analyst acknowledged that the Bitcoin market is \u201cmuch larger and more established compared to earlier halvings.\u201d However, Phung still expects a price increase after the halving, although she admitted that the exact timing is uncertain, meaning it could be earlier or even later than usual. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also echoed a similar sentiment about how things could be different this cycle when he shared his analysis of the five phases of the Bitcoin Halving. Specifically, he stated that the Re-accumulation phase \u201cmay not last very long before additional uptrend continuation\u201d since this is the first time the Re-accumulation range will be around a new ATH.

She predicts that crypto investors will likely be bullish once the halving takes place, considering the significance of the event on Bitcoin\u2019s supply. However, once the excitement about the halving wears off, several metrics, such as price charts, trading volume, social media discussions, and on-chain data like active addresses or exchange supply, will need to be analyzed to determine whether or not investors are still bullish. Meanwhile, Phung suggested that the price surge that occurs immediately after the Bitcoin halving may not be shortlived this time around since more institutional investors are now involved and have helped create a \u201cmore mature market.\u201d","article_summary":"Hannah Phung, a lead analyst at on-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain, recently gave her opinion on the impact that Bitcoin Halving could have on the flaghsip crypto\u2019s price.

At the same time, Shiba Inu has now crossed a major milestone in the number of addresses, which could mean an increase in the number of holders. Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Drops The price of Shiba Inu can easily be moved by selling and buying pressure from investors. Recent on-chain data, however, indicates that the selling pressure is currently decreasing, which could manifest in the price of the SHIB in the coming week. Particularly, IntoTheBlock\u2019s historical active address by profitability shows the yearly average now shifting towards wallet addresses at the money.

Interestingly, this indicates they might be opting to hold right now in order to increase their unrealized profits. Similarly, on-chain data shows a substantial amount of SHIB moving out of the hands of short-term holders, contributing to a drop in selling pressure. About 4% of the entire circulating supply of SHIB has moved from short-term holders to mid-term holders in the past week. Mid-term holders hold their assets for more than a month to a year, in contrast to short-term holders, who are known for holding for less than a month before selling. What\u2019s Next For SHIB? With decreasing sell pressure and a shift to longer holding times, SHIB is poised for a reversal and continued upward momentum. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002766, down by 1.1% in the past 24 hours and up by 4.65% in a larger 7-day timeframe.

Ripple just unlocked a massive amount of tokens from escrow, which could threaten the price further. Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP In the early hours of Friday, on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert posted two transactions carrying a notable number of XRP tokens. The first transaction saw 200 million tokens unlocked from the escrow wallet, worth $122.63 million at the time of the transfer. The second transaction came minutes later when a total of 300 million XRP tokens were also unclosed from escrow. This second tranche of tokens, being larger than the first, was worth $183.89 million at the time, bringing the total number of unlocked tokens to 500 million. Together, both transactions were worth over $300 million. These unlocks have, unsurprisingly, stirred concern in the Ripple community for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that Ripple never does unlocks in the middle of the month. Rather, they do scheduled unlocks at the start of each month. So, these transactions have drawn the attention of the crypto community. Another cause for concern is the fact that Ripple could be selling these XRP tokens. Hence, putting more tokens in circulation and adding more selling pressure to the already struggling digital asset. However, Ripple has not shown any indication of what these unlocks could be for as there have been no transfer transactions since then, just the unlock transactions. Unlocks Can Send Price Crashing?

But most times, the majority of the unlocked tokens are sent back to escrow. Usually, these unlocks do not negatively affect the altcoin\u2019s price, but that\u2019s when the unlocks are expected. This time around, the unlocks are unplanned, leading to speculation as to why Ripple would be unlocking XRP tokens outside of the unlock schedule. So far, the XRP price seems to not be reacting to the unlock at all. It continues to trend around $0.61, with small losses of 0.91% in the last day. However, the altcoin is still seeing 4.74% gains in the last week, showing the positive upside that it saw earlier in the week.","article_summary":"XRP has struggled to a higher degree compared to the others in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and it seems like the bearish sentiment is far from over.

Since announcing his candidacy in mid-February, Deaton has also raised $360,690 from individual contributors, leaving him with nearly $1.4 million cash on hand. According to the Federal Election Commission, Deaton outraised Warren in the race\u2019s first quarter, with Deaton raising a total of $1.36 million to Warren\u2019s $1.1 million.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company\u2019s executive chairman and co-founder, Chris Larsen, also contributed the maximum $6,600 each, split between the primary and general election campaigns, underscoring Deaton\u2019s support from key industry players. However, it should be noted that Deaton faces a challenging campaign against Warren, who has a significant financial advantage with $4.4 million in her campaign war chest. This solidifies her position as the \u201cheavy favorite\u201d to win the Senate battle against the pro-XRP attorney in what is considered a \u201creliably blue state.\u201d High-Stakes Senate Race A spokesperson for Warren emphasized that her campaign is powered by \u201csmall-dollar donations,\u201d emphasizing grassroots support rather than \u201cspecial interests attempting to elevate candidates.\u201d Nevertheless, Deaton\u2019s challenge against Warren extends beyond a political rivalry, representing the ongoing debate surrounding the role of cryptocurrencies and their regulation in the United States. Deaton has previously stated, \u201cRegular people are sick and tired of different rules being applied to Washington insiders. We need real leadership in Washington, DC.\u201d Deaton, an ex-US Naval officer from Detroit who attended Eastern Michigan University and New England Law Boston, moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island in late January, shortly before he announced his Senate candidacy. While Warren\u2019s record of service and establishment support pose significant challenges, the crypto industry\u2019s endorsement and call for change, coupled with the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, gives Deaton significant leverage in his campaign. The outcome of this high-profile race will not only determine a political representative but also shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.

This has caused a suppressed price action over the last week, stopping the meme coin\u2019s advancement in its tracks. However, the outlook still remains bullish for the DOGE price, with crypto analysts expecting the rally to continue soon and the price to double. Dogecoin Forms Bull Flag Pattern The Dogecoin performance over the past month has been quite encouraging, and despite hitting a roadblock with its rally, it has continued to show bullish tendencies. The most recent of the bullish moves which the meme coin has pulled is the formation of a bull flag pattern on its chart. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the cryptocurrency\u2019s chart had showed something interesting on the daily chart. According to the analysis, the movements that Dogecoin has made over the last few weeks has led to a bull flag formation on the daily chart. Now, the main driver of the rally that is supposed to follow this formation is the DOGE price breaking out from the bull flag, which is yet to happen. But as the crypto analyst explains, a breakout from here would send Dogecoin\u2019s price at least 2x higher than its current level. A successful break above the $0.205 level would confirm this bullish formation. However, DOGE has been unable to achieve this, still trading below $0.2 at the time of writing. This could also be a hard-won battle for the meme coin as Bitcoin\u2019s uncertain moves continue to drag the crypto market down. When Will DOGE Make This Move? The month of April is expected to be bullish for the Dogecoin price, and the crypto analyst\u2019s price shows this. The expected timeframe for the bullish breakout is sometime this month, which would put it in the next few weeks. Trader Tardigrade\u2019s target shows an over 100% increase from the current price level, reaching as high as $0.4 in the short term. This move could be spurred on by the Bitcoin halving happening this month, which is expected to propel bullish sentiment. Expectations for the Bitcoin price are that it will reach $80,000, and this move would no doubt pull up the rest of the crypto market, causing coins like Dogecoin to surge. At the time of writing, the DOGE price was trending at $0.19, with a 1.61% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly time frame, its price is up 14%, coming in second to Toncoin (TON) for the best performer in the top 10.","article_summary":"The Dogecoin price has continued to trend around the $0.19-$0.2 level after encountering significant resistance from the bears at this level.

Gopax\u2019s Revenue Surge And Net Loss Reduction Despite challenges related to liquidity issues and regulatory scrutiny, Gopax narrowed its net loss to 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) last year, compared to 90.6 billion won in the previous year. The financial report further showcased Gopax\u2019s notable performance in 2023, with a roughly 97% year-over-year growth in revenue, reaching 3.1 billion won. Additionally, the exchange reduced its net operating loss by 78% to approximately 17 billion won. As reported, these positive results were largely attributed to the resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean crypto market, which emerged as one of the \u201cmost active\u201d crypto markets globally in 2023. Despite its revenue growth, Gopax encountered notable hurdles, particularly regarding its association with Genesis Global Capital, which had a subsequent halt of withdrawals stemming from a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement in FTX in 2022. The situation resulted in substantial losses for Gopax, with funds from its GoFi-linked debt stuck in Genesis Global Capital, totaling 63.7 billion won. However, Binance, Gopax\u2019s major shareholder, stepped in to address liquidity issues and \u201cacquired\u201d the exchange in February 2023, aiming to penetrate the South Korean market. According to the report, Binance\u2019s acquisition positioned the global exchange as the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake. Binance\u2019s Global Challenges And Resilience However, Binance itself has been navigating regulatory challenges from several corners globally. Among these challenges is the $4.3 billion fine settlement with the US Department of Justice and even the crackdown from the Nigerian government. Additionally, the crypto exchange has recently faced a ban from the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As reported, the SEC\u2019s decision was based on Binance\u2019s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform in the region. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino noted: The SEC has identified the aforementioned [Binance] platform and concluded that the public\u2019s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos. In response to these regulatory hurdles globally, Binance\u2019s CEO, Richard Teng, recently outlined a new strategy focused on addressing \u201ccultural issues\u201d and \u201cenhancing compliance efforts.\u201d Notably, despite all of these challenges Binance has faced recently, the exchange\u2019s native token, BNB, has maintained its trading value above $600, boasting green days up by 6.6% in the past 7 days and 2.2% in the past 24 hours with a current market price of $612.

Ripple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse has now joined the conversation, as he recently commented on whether or not the market could witness other crypto funds soon enough. \u201cThere Will Be Other ETFs\u201d Garlinghouse mentioned during an appearance at the Paris Blockchain Week that he \u201cthinks there will be other ETFs.\u201d However, he added that this will take \u201ca little bit of time\u201d because of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) reservations about crypto assets. The Commission is known for its enforcement actions against several crypto projects, including Ripple. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse further suggested that XRP would be among those crypto assets with its ETF when the time comes, as he noted that XRP and Bitcoin were the only crypto tokens with regulatory clarity. XRP achieved this status following Judge Analisa Torres\u2019s ruling that the crypto token wasn\u2019t a security. Unlike Garlinghouse, some other market experts haven\u2019t sounded optimistic about whether an XRP ETF could come soon. Van Buren Capital\u2019s general partner, Scott Johnsson, mentioned that the SEC\u2019s likelihood of approving an XRP ETF is \u201cvery slim.\u201d He further opined that Gary Gensler will need to be replaced before the SEC can approve an XRP ETF. Ark Invest\u2019s CEO Cathie Wood also once predicted that there would only likely be Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs in the US, thereby shoving aside the idea of an XRP ETF. Back then, she mentioned that it would be surprising to see \u201canything but Bitcoin and Ether being approved by the SEC,\u201d possibly due to the SEC\u2019s non-recognition of other crypto assets besides those two. What Needs To Happen Before An XRP ETF Can Launch In addition to the SEC\u2019s reservations about the XRP token, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart highlighted another factor that could impede the launch of an XRP ETF. He stated that the absence of XRP on a regulated market like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) makes it more unlikely for the SEC to approve an XRP ETF. His comment relates to the fact that the SEC previously rejected the applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF on the grounds that they were susceptible to market manipulation. However, in the Grayscale case, the court ruled that the spot and futures markets were correlated. This paved the way for the subsequent approval of these funds since Bitcoin futures were already listed on the CME. Therefore, the potential listing of XRP futures on the CME could also pave the way for XRP ETFs since issuers can argue that the CME, being a regulated market, can help prevent market manipulation.","article_summary":"Since the Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) were approved, market experts have continued to give their opinions on the possibility of other crypto ETFs, such as an XRP ETF launching soon.

According to a South China Morning Post report, the partnership aims to allow users in the Asia-Pacific region to exchange their Toncoin for cash, creating an on-ramp and off-ramp for the cryptocurrency. The agreement also encompasses the joint exploration of new ecosystem projects, mentorship opportunities, networking, and other incubation activities, as the Open Network Foundation announced. TON Foundation Prioritizes Compliance The Foundation was established following Telegram\u2019s decision to abandon its TON blockchain due to a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Despite this setback, the foundation has continued to develop the blockchain and integrated it into Telegram through a mini app and business arrangements. Although the Foundation aims to maintain a separate identity from Telegram, its blockchain\u2019s primary utility remains closely linked to the popular messaging app, which boasts over 900 million global users. The collaboration with HashKey is viewed as a significant opportunity by the TON Foundation. HashKey\u2019s regulatory compliance measures, particularly in adhering to know-your-customer (KYC) rules, are expected to facilitate the integration of Toncoin into the Telegram ecosystem. The Open Network Foundation President Steve Yun emphasized the importance of compliance and expressed confidence in \u201cstrategically\u201d following the requirements to ensure regulatory adherence. The Foundation views Telegram\u2019s \u201cmini app ecosystem\u201d as a crucial driver for adopting its blockchain. Moreover, the blockchain has secured premium real estate within the Telegram app, making its blockchain the default wallet option in the sidebar. However, the network faces regulatory challenges, restricting the use of the cryptocurrency function within Telegram for individuals in certain jurisdictions, including the US, China, and Hong Kong. Asia\u2019s \u2018Super App\u2019 Market For Toncoin Adoption According to the report, TON recognizes Asia as a natural fit for its expansion due to the region\u2019s familiarity with the concept of \u201csuper apps.\u201d The partnership with HashKey aims to leverage the existing \u201csuper app\u201d culture prevalent in Asia-Pacific, with renowned platforms such as Line, Kakao, and WeChat. HashKey recently launched a global crypto exchange and received an upgraded license from Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission, enabling it to sell crypto-related investment products to retail investors. Notably, HashKey aims to surpass Coinbase\u2019s trading volume by 2030, positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the crypto exchange landscape. Ultimately, the partnership between HashKey Group and the Open Network Foundation opens new avenues for Toncoin adoption and cash conversion in the Asia-Pacific region. By integrating Toncoin into the Telegram ecosystem, both organizations aim to cater to millions of potential Asian users who are already familiar with the \u201csuper app\u201d concept. Currently, the native token of the blockchain, TON, is trading at $7.14, reflecting a slight decline of nearly 3% within the last 24 hours. However, an analysis of the 1-day TON/USD chart reveals a noteworthy upward trend spanning the past 30 days. The token has exhibited substantial gains during this period, amounting to 63%.

The developer\u2019s warning comes amidst the growing anticipation within the Dogecoin community, spurred by Coinbase\u2019s recent announcement of a potential listing for Dogecoin futures this April. Mishaboar has warned DOGE investors to avoid the leverages and derivatives market at all times, but more so in the coming weeks. Responding to an inquiry from community members seeking clarification for his statements, Mishaboar elaborated that cryptocurrency trading is inherently a risky business; however, the leverages and derivatives market had a higher risk level, to the point of it being unacceptable. \u201cThe unfairness and risk you expose yourself to is not worth it in a market where assets are already so volatile,\u201d Mishaboar wrote.

This development was made in alignment with Coinbase\u2019s expansion strategy to extend their futures contracts to meet the needs of their growing network of traders. Additionally, the announcement comes at a time when Coinbase launched their new Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin futures contracts. The exchange revealed that expanding its offerings to these cryptocurrencies would improve access to digital asset trading and enable traders to participate with reduced capital within a regulated framework. In addition to its upcoming Dogecoin futures listing, Coinbase revealed in an X post published on Thursday that it would be adding support for the popular frog-themed meme coin, Pepe (PEPE), in its perpetual futures offerings.

Bitcoin Inflows For Binance & OKX Have Stayed Low Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a post on X, the BTC deposits for cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and OKX have been low recently. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the \u201cexchange inflow,\u201d which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that\u2019s being transferred to the wallets attached to centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are depositing a large number of tokens to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why holders would transfer to the exchanges is for selling-purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator being low implies these platforms aren\u2019t observing that many deposits currently. Depending on the trend in the opposite metric, the exchange outflow, such a value may be either bullish or neutral for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow for Binance and OKX over the past few years: Binance is the largest exchange in the world on the basis of trading volume, while OKX is generally number two behind it in the same metric. While these two platforms certainly don\u2019t make up for the entire cryptocurrency market, the user behavior on them would still provide an estimation about the wider pattern. As is visible in the chart, the exchange inflow for Binance and OKX has been at relatively low levels for quite a while now. When BTC observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH) earlier in the year, the deposits saw a slight uptrend, but recently, the inflows slumped back to low values. This would suggest that the appetite for selling, particularly from the whales, just hasn\u2019t been there for the cryptocurrency. Even the ATH break could only entice a few large users of the platforms to push towards selling. The behavior is in contrast to, for example, the second half of the 2021 bull run, which can be seen in the chart. The rally back then had not only observed some exceptional inflow spikes, but the baseline inflows had also generally been higher than recent levels. Interestingly, the two major tops of the rally had also coincided pretty well with extremely large inflows, so going by this pattern, the current rally may not be near a top yet. Though, it remains to be seen whether this same trend would continue to hold for this cycle, given the fresh emergence of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ETFs have provided an alternate means to gain exposure to the asset, meaning that cryptocurrency exchanges may not carry the same relevance in the market anymore.

US District Judge Victor Marrero handed down the sentence, marking a significant milestone in crypto-related law enforcement. DeFi Hacker Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison Shakeeb Ahmed utilized his extensive knowledge in reverse engineering and blockchain audits to manipulate smart contracts on the exchanges. US Attorney Damian Williams states this case represents the first-ever conviction for hacking a smart contract. \u201cNo matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today\u2019s sentence shows, time in prison \u2014 and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto \u2014 is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks,\u201d Williams emphasized. On July 2 and 3, 2022, Ahmed targeted the first exchange by injecting fake pricing data, generating $9 million in inflated fees, which he then illicitly withdrew. In a subsequent communication with the exchange, Ahmed agreed to return the stolen funds except for $1.5 million, provided the exchange did not report the attack to law enforcement. A few weeks later, on July 28, Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in Nirvana Finance\u2019s smart contracts. This second attack drained Nirvana of approximately $3.6 million, nearly all its funds, forcing the platform to shut down. Ahmed declined Nirvana\u2019s substantial bug bounty offer, opting to keep the stolen assets.

These included swapping tokens across blockchains, converting assets into the untraceable crypto Monero, and utilizing overseas exchanges and cryptocurrency mixers. In addition to prison time, the court has ordered Ahmed to forfeit around $12.3 million in stolen assets. He must also pay restitution exceeding $5 million to the affected exchanges.

Slated for release between late 2024 and early 2025, the Pectra upgrade focuses on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074 and EIP 2935. These vital modifications aim to transform how users interact with Ethereum wallets. Ethereum Community Discusses Pros and Cons of Pectra During a recent bi-weekly call, Ethereum developers announced that EIP 3074 would be central to the Pectra upgrade. Tim Beiko, a core Ethereum developer, confirmed its inclusion with a post on April 11. This upgrade will introduce several smart contract functionalities to ordinary Ethereum wallets, significantly enhancing the user experience. Read more: Ethereum EIPs: What Are They? How Are They Implemented? According to Domothy, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, EIP 3074 will introduce a novel social recovery tool. This tool requires users to initially transfer asset ownership to an invoker contract via a digital signature. This contract will facilitate future transactions and enable users to reclaim their assets if they lose or forget their seed phrase. Additionally, EIP 3074 eliminates the need for users to have Ethereum in their wallets to execute transactions. The entity behind the invoker contract can cover these costs upfront. This feature could significantly expand Ethereum\u2019s appeal by lowering the barriers to entry for new users. Moreover, EIP 3074 allows the batching of transactions. Users can approve multiple transactions at once, streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency. On-chain analyst Hitesh Malviya praises this upgrade for its potential impact on Web3 gaming. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a game-changer for web3 gaming, where you can sign your session once and then play the whole game without worrying about interacting with smart contracts,\u201d Malviya stated. Uniswap developer Hayden Adams echoes this enthusiasm, describing the inclusion of EIP 3074 as a \u201cmonumental upgrade to Ethereum UX.\u201d However, the upgrade has also raised concerns. \u201cDownside of EIP 3074 is that now it\u2019ll be possible to fully drain an address (all tokens, all NFTs, all defi positions\u2026) with only one bad signature,\u201d DefiLlama co-founder 0xngmi said.

The entire Rebel Satoshi ecosystem is built on its dual-token system of the $RBLZ and the $RECQ tokens. Rebel Satoshi aims to grow to a $100 million market cap. Also, the presale of the $RBLZ token generated 150% returns and raised over $2.5 million for its investors. Right now, Rebel Satoshi is conducting the presale of the $RECQ tokens at $0.0037 per token in Stage 1. The $RECQ token has rallied by 85% to reach the current price, and over 74% of tokens have already been sold out. By the end of the presale, the $RECQ token is forecast to surge by 238% to $0.0125. That\u2019s why some analysts are describing the $RECQ token as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Injective continues to trade in red after rising to an all-time high The Injective (INJ) token has been one of the best performers in the recent market surge. As a result, the Injective price rose to an all-time high of $52.75 on March 13. Since then, the INJ token has been on a downtrend. As of the second week of April, the INJ price dropped by 34.6% to trade at around $34.45. Amid the price drop, the Injective (INJ) ecosystem has continued to grow exponentially. For instance, the Ionic Upgrade to the Injective Bridge was announced on March 26. The first DePin platform on Injective (INJ), Aurora, was introduced on April 7. These developments and others in the Injective ecosystem have led to a bullish outlook. Experts predict that the INJ token could rise above $40 again in the coming months. Terra Classic trades sideways after getting caught in market volatility The Terra Classic (LUNC) token has been caught up in volatility ever since rising in March. Initially, the LUNC token price dropped to $0.000121 on March 19 before bouncing slightly. The Terra Classic price then rose by 41.3% to $0.000171 a week later before dipping again. Since then, the Terra Classic (LUNC) has entered a downtrend, dipping by 20.4% to around the $0.000136 level. This drop in LUNC price has occurred despite Binance burning 4.1 billion LUNC on April 2. As the massive token burn has failed to turn the Terra Classic token bullish, experts are increasingly bearish on it. Hence, many are predicting that the Terra Classic (LUNC) will drop below $0.000120 in the coming months.

NuggetRush token emerges as a promising altcoin with play-to-earn gaming features. Cardano prioritizes security and scalability for smart contracts, while Ethereum faces technical challenges but maintains its commitment to decentralization. Amidst a recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have demonstrated signs of steadiness, as both assets have seen remarkable increases in value. At the same time, some analysts are shifting their attention to NuggetRush (NUGX), assessing its potential to become the next altcoin sensation. This digital asset offers innovative features and potential for growth in the crypto community. NuggetRush is among the bullish altcoins incorporating a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming design, allowing participants to earn tangible assets as prizes. Its innovative offerings strive to foster an engaging gaming atmosphere, attracting investors and gaming enthusiasts alike. The blockchain ICO presale is gaining momentum and piquing crypto investors\u2019 interest. This article explores why Ethereum and Cardano show remarkable gains as analysts eye NUGX tokens as the next altcoin sensations. NuggetRush (NUGX): decentralized GameFi exploration and real-world rewards NuggetRush is a new DeFi project fostering a vibrant community within a flourishing digital ecosystem focused on GameFi exploration. Operating on the Ethereum blockchain, NuggetRush prioritizes broad user accessibility. NUGX captures attention through blending exploration, strategic thinking, and tangible real-world benefits. Analysts suggest it may be one of the bullish altcoins poised for significant gains this year. The platform presents diverse avenues for gamers to accumulate rewards, including acquiring unique character NFTs, earning RUSHGEMS, and trading in-game assets. NuggetRush differentiates itself from typical meme coins by enabling players to trade their in-game earnings outside the platform\u2019s ecosystem. This new DeFi project has also established a player-driven marketplace for character NFTs and other exclusive items. This enriches the platform\u2019s economy and empowers users to exchange and sell virtual assets. NuggetRush has already garnered immense support, with over 271 million tokens sold and more than $3.75 million raised. Some industry analysts are predicting that once NUGX is listed on major exchanges, its price could experience a significant surge, potentially reaching $0.020. This anticipated price increase could position NUGX as one of the best crypto investment options right now. The NuggetRush vesting system presents an appealing incentive for early adopters. Through participation in the presale phase, investors can access up to 50% of the tokens across five claim rounds based on their entry timing. This mechanism could enable early supporters to realize substantial gains as the project progresses. Cardano (ADA): scalable ecosystem for smart contracts and DApps Cardano is a decentralized platform that creates a more secure and scalable infrastructure for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Cardano is trading at approximately $0.5877, showing stability amidst market fluctuations. As the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event approaches, alternative coins like Cardano are garnering attention. ADA showcases resilience and growth potential amid market volatility. This has piqued the interest of investors and traders seeking promising alternatives within the cryptocurrency landscape. Cardano has seen a remarkable turnaround in investor sentiment. After facing outflows, there\u2019s now a substantial $1.1 million inflow into ADA investment products. This shift highlights Cardano\u2019s resurgence and growing appeal among crypto investors. The influx of funds indicates a renewed confidence in Cardano\u2019s potential, marking a positive trend after a period of uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH): empowering decentralization with smart contracts Ethereum is a blockchain network that is decentralized and open-source, with the ability to execute smart contracts. The current price of Ethereum is approximately $3,315, which represents an increase of nearly 2%. After a significant upward trend from the $3,500 support level, ETH is now facing resistance around $3,550 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA). The hourly ETH/USD chart reveals a notable resistance zone at $3,550. Technical indicators indicate that the hourly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains bullish for ETH. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits below the 50 level, suggesting potential increased selling pressure. Despite recent challenges, Ethereum\u2019s repeated tests of crucial support levels hint at the possibility of a rapid price recovery. Conclusion As Ethereum and Cardano continue demonstrating remarkable gains in the cryptocurrency market, analysts are now setting their sights on the NuggetRush token as the next potential altcoin sensation. NuggetRush is an intriguing platform that combines gaming with decentralized finance principles. Its unique approach presents an attractive investment prospect for those interested in the growing GameFi industry. With growing excitement surrounding NUGX\u2019s listing on major exchanges and the continued development of its ecosystem, this token\u2019s future appears promising. It has the potential to create ripples within the ever-changing cryptocurrency world. For more information on NUGX, visit NuggetRush Presale Website.

This strategic realignment could position Mastercard to compete more effectively in a rapidly evolving payments industry. Doubling Down on Core Payments: Jorn Lambert's move to Chief Product Officer signifies the continued importance of Mastercard's traditional business \u2013 facilitating secure and efficient card transactions. This focus ensures they stay competitive against rivals like Visa and emerging players in the global payments network. Expanding the Commercial Landscape: Raj Seshadri's appointment as Chief Commercial Payments Officer reflects Mastercard's ambition to broaden its reach beyond consumer credit cards.

In the heart of India's digital payment revolution, a battleground is emerging \u2013 the war of the wallets. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent decision to allow third-party UPI apps to access prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) has ignited a firestorm of potential, and the fight for customer loyalty is about to get fierce. This isn't your typical corporate clash. The combatants here are a diverse bunch \u2013 established giants like Paytm, scrappy fintech startups, and even brick-and-mortar retailers with their own loyalty programs. Until now, PPIs operated in closed gardens, forcing users to stick to the app provided by the issuer. This fragmented landscape stifled competition and limited the reach of digital payments, especially for smaller transactions. The RBI's move dismantles these walls, throwing the doors wide open for innovation. It's much like your local coffee shop's loyalty card morphing into your go-to payment method for online shopping. Or a small business owner seamlessly integrating their existing PPI system with a user-friendly UPI app, attracting a wider customer base. Suddenly, the possibilities for seamless and convenient digital payments explode. This isn't just about convenience, it's about power. The dominance of giants like Paytm, with its staggering $19.1 billion GMV in FY23, is under threat. Smaller players now have a fighting chance, offering unique features and experiences to woo users. Competition breeds choice, and consumers stand to benefit with a wider array of options and potentially lower fees. But the real prize lies in financial inclusion. By removing the restriction to a single app, the RBI is making digital payments more accessible for millions. Small businesses, often reliant on cash transactions, can now tap into the digital ecosystem with ease. Individuals new to the digital realm no longer face the hurdle of navigating a specific PPI issuer's app. This inclusivity can be a game-changer, driving financial empowerment and propelling India's ambition to become a digital payments powerhouse. However, the war won't be won without casualties. Security concerns need to be addressed to ensure a safe environment for transactions across different platforms. User experience will also be a battleground \u2013 clunky interfaces and a lack of interoperability can quickly turn customers away. The RBI's decision is a bold move, but the true test lies in execution. Can India create a robust infrastructure that fosters healthy competition while prioritizing security and user experience? The answer will determine the victor in the war of the wallets, but the ultimate winner will be India itself, paving the way for a future where digital payments become the norm, not the exception. This disruption has the potential to not just reshape India's financial landscape, but act as a blueprint for other developing economies looking to embrace the future of money. The war drums are beating, and the world is watching. The Great Wallet War has just begun. This article was written by Pedro Ferreira at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Forget plastic and forget cash. In the heart of India's digital payment revolution, a battleground is emerging \u2013 the war of the wallets. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent decision to allow third-party UPI apps to access prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) has ignited a firestorm of potential, and the fight for customer loyalty is about to get fierce. This isn't your typical corporate clash. The combatants here are a diverse bunch \u2013 established giants like Paytm, scrappy fintech startups, and even brick-and-mortar retailers with their own loyalty programs. Until now, PPIs operated in closed gardens, forcing users to stick to the app provided by the issuer. This fragmented landscape stifled competition and limited the reach of digital payments, especially for smaller transactions. The RBI's move dismantles these walls, throwing the doors wide open for innovation. It's much like your local coffee shop's loyalty card morphing into your go-to payment method for online shopping. Or a small business owner seamlessly integrating their existing PPI system with a user-friendly UPI app, attracting a wider customer base. Suddenly, the possibilities for seamless and convenient digital payments explode. This isn't just about convenience, it's about power. The dominance of giants like Paytm, with its staggering $19.1 billion GMV in FY23, is under threat. Smaller players now have a fighting chance, offering unique features and experiences to woo users. Competition breeds choice, and consumers stand to benefit with a wider array of options and potentially lower fees. But the real prize lies in financial inclusion. By removing the restriction to a single app, the RBI is making digital payments more accessible for millions. Small businesses, often reliant on cash transactions, can now tap into the digital ecosystem with ease. Individuals new to the digital realm no longer face the hurdle of navigating a specific PPI issuer's app. This inclusivity can be a game-changer, driving financial empowerment and propelling India's ambition to become a digital payments powerhouse. However, the war won't be won without casualties. Security concerns need to be addressed to ensure a safe environment for transactions across different platforms. User experience will also be a battleground \u2013 clunky interfaces and a lack of interoperability can quickly turn customers away. The RBI's decision is a bold move, but the true test lies in execution. Can India create a robust infrastructure that fosters healthy competition while prioritizing security and user experience? The answer will determine the victor in the war of the wallets, but the ultimate winner will be India itself, paving the way for a future where digital payments become the norm, not the exception. This disruption has the potential to not just reshape India's financial landscape, but act as a blueprint for other developing economies looking to embrace the future of money. The war drums are beating, and the world is watching. The Great Wallet War has just begun.

Forget quaint cafes and charming cobblestone streets; the real buzz surrounds something far more disruptive: cryptocurrency. This once fringe technology is shedding its shadowy reputation and stepping into the bright lights of everyday transactions, not just in Lugano, but with the potential to transform our global financial landscape. Lugano isn't just dipping its toes in the crypto pool; it's diving headfirst. The city has embraced cryptocurrencies like a long-lost friend, allowing residents to pay for everything from lattes to taxes using digital tokens. This isn't some pilot program cobbled together with duct tape and optimism. Lugano has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to create a robust infrastructure that supports payments in Bitcoin, Tether, and even their very own local token, LVGA. The early results are promising \u2013 over 15% of Lugano's citizens have already incorporated crypto into their daily routines. But why Lugano? Why now? The answer lies in a perfect storm of necessity and opportunity. Switzerland, with its reputation for innovation and a progressive approach to finance, provided fertile ground for the seeds of crypto adoption to take root. Lugano, a city eager to boost its economy and attract new residents, saw crypto as a golden ticket. By embracing this new financial frontier, they've positioned themselves at the forefront of a movement that could redefine how we pay for everything. Convenience, the cornerstone of successful payment methods, is a hurdle crypto needs to clear. While tech-savvy early adopters scoff at the clunky interfaces and slow transaction times of traditional banking, the average citizen craves a seamless experience. Lugano's success hinges on making crypto as effortless to use as swiping a debit card. Here, the city's partnership with Bitfinex proves crucial. The exchange has developed a user-friendly platform that streamlines payments, allowing residents to pay with a simple QR code scan. This eliminates the complexities often associated with crypto transactions, making it a more palatable option for the everyday user. The fear of the unknown is another hurdle crypto must overcome. Decentralized currencies, free from the oversight of traditional financial institutions, can feel unsettling to some. Lugano's approach directly addresses this concern. By partnering with a reputable exchange like Bitfinex, they've instilled a sense of trust and legitimacy in the system. Residents know their hard-earned crypto is in safe hands, paving the way for wider acceptance. Of course, Lugano isn't the only place where crypto is making inroads into the mainstream. Crypto credit cards are gaining traction, allowing users to spend their digital currency at any store that accepts traditional cards. Forward-thinking companies like Microsoft and even Wikipedia are now welcoming Bitcoin payments. These baby steps, coupled with the success story unfolding in Lugano, paint a compelling picture of a future where crypto becomes a familiar face at the checkout counter. But crypto's ascent to financial stardom won't be without its share of drama. Regulation, the bane of many an innovation's existence, will undoubtedly play a role. Governments will grapple with how to integrate this disruptive technology into the existing financial framework. Finding the right balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers will be a delicate dance. The road ahead for crypto is paved with both promise and peril. Challenges abound, but the potential rewards are undeniable. Cities like Lugano are proving that crypto can be more than just a speculative asset class; it can become a practical tool that transforms how we manage our money. As crypto sheds its cloak of obscurity and ventures into the public square, one thing is certain: the way we pay for our daily lives is on the cusp of a fascinating metamorphosis. Lugano may be the stage for the opening act, but the global financial drama is just beginning.

On day one, $4.6B in shares were traded, with cumulative trading volume exceeding the $50B mark by February 22. The ETF approval in the U.S. is expected to have a far-reaching impact across Asian markets where investment flows are already significant, especially in institutional investing, and picking up pace. The question on the minds of observers, investors, and industry participants is: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d By taking stock of what has happened in the US and as we look East, we can better understand what to expect in markets like Hong Kong and other countries in the region. Spotlight on Hong Kong Optimism for approval exists about a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong. In January, they accepted the first application from one of China\u2019s major asset funds, Harvest Fund Management. Although hopes existed for approval as early as Q1 2024, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see it take until at least Q2. Approvals of traditional ETFs by Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) typically take weeks to months. Given that Hong Kong has already approved a few crypto ETF futures funds\u2014including the CSOP Bitcoin Futures, CSOP Ether Futures, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures\u2014one can reasonably hope that the path to a spot ETF approval will come with time. On the face of it, giving those approvals would make sense all around. Hong Kong serves as a conduit to China\u2019s wealth and has established a regulatory environment to go alongside the depth of its asset and wealth management sector. Plus, because Hong Kong already offers Ethereum futures, they may be more open to spot Ethereum ETFs. In comparison to the U.S., the SEC has received applications for spot Ethereum ETFs with a response required by May 23, although it was allowable earlier; on February 7, the SEC issued a delay statement. Assessing the Likelihood of Approval From Other Asian Countries The only major countries in the APAC region in which spot Bitcoin ETFs are not in any stage of development seem to be China, Thailand, and Singapore. Major Asian countries that will likely follow in the general pathway of the U.S. and Hong Kong include Japan, South Korea, and Australia; although these are relatively early days, people are already expressing interest in these products. Regulations in each country are somewhat different, and so the paths towards crypto product approvals will also differ. South Korea The country\u2019s Virtual Asset User Protection Act is set to go into effect in July 2024. This gives South Korea\u2019s Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea the authority to oversee crypto exchanges and custodians. Although news stories have provided conflicting information about the likelihood of spot Bitcoin approvals, two key factors point to optimism. First, politicians running for election are more open to the idea. Next, Governor Lee Bok-hyun of the Financial Supervisory Service is set to meet with the U.S. SEC\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler, in May to discuss spot Bitcoin ETFs. At minimum, this shows South Korea\u2019s openness to the financial product. Japan Encouraging signs also exist in Japan. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, the country\u2019s cabinet approved a bill that permits the nation\u2019s investment funds and venture capital companies to acquire crypto. If passed by Parliament, then this will become law. Plus, some of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions, as part of a consortium of more than seventy Japanese companies, are expected to launch a yen-backed digital currency in July 2024 privately. This comes alongside Japan\u2019s government pension fund recently mentioning that it is requesting information on \u201cilliquidity assets,\u201d such as bitcoin, as part of research into potential new investments. Although neither of these actions would directly allow a spot Bitcoin ETF, they both will play a role in creating a more crypto-friendly environment. Australia Australia\u2019s enthusiasm for Bitcoin has \u201cdemonstrably shifted\u201d after the SEC approval. Across demographics, positive Bitcoin sentiment increased by 25 percent while, specifically looking at people aged fifty-five and up, the news boosted Bitcoin favorability by 100 percent. Plus, this enthusiasm already has an outlet with many people in Australia able to invest in the U.S. ETFs, with predictions suggesting that the Australian Securities Exchange will soon make similar products available. It\u2019s already highly anticipated that Monochrome Asset Management, located in Brisbane, Australia, will launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in H1 2024, with the U.S. approval possibility speeding up the approval. What\u2019s Stopping More Regulatory-Approved Crypto Businesses? As countries create regulations and structures for crypto products worldwide, two key topics regularly arise the need for anti-money laundering (AML) rules and counter-terrorism financing (CTF). This may be especially important in Asia, where the threat of money laundering and terrorist funding is significant, Hong Kong and Singapore, for example, have strict requirements for exchanges that want to receive a crypto license. Then, transactions are stringently monitored with know your customers (KYC) procedures diligently followed. Because these are key financial centers, tripping up can have costly effects, including on the reputations of the firms that skip steps or otherwise don\u2019t conform. In South Korea, all registered and licensed exchanges need to have a banking partner because of money laundering concerns and the related terrorist financing of North Korea. When opening a crypto account in that Asian country, banking details and KYC data are linked to the crypto exchange account for transparent fund flows to satisfy regulator concerns. For spot Bitcoin ETF approval, questions about market manipulation\u2014a concern listed by Gensler when delaying U.S. approval\u2014will also need to be addressed to the satisfaction of Asian regulators. Visibility is also important to allow regulators and investors to feel confident, which will help crypto products become a bigger part of the financial pie. These structures and guardrails can allay concerns and lay the foundation for further growth. Plus, safe, secure custody for crypto products must be firmly in place in Asia and worldwide. Optimism exists for all of this foundational work to occur in ways that allow Asian countries to participate in the in-demand crypto products like spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs in ways that satisfy AML, CTF, and market manipulation concerns with safe and secure custody provided.

Huawei is on a trade restriction list after the United States accused it of relations with Iran and violation based on these very links in 2019. True or not, but it\u2019s a part of the wide ranging campaign to restrict China\u2019s progress in developing the latest telecommunication technology. US vendors and suppliers are bound to obtain a special license, which is often too difficult to get approval for, before dealing with any company placed on the trade restriction list. Back in 2020, the Trump administration gave a license to Intel, approving the supply of central processors to Huawei for their laptop manufacturing. Skeptics have pressurized the Biden government for the annulment of that license, but many have accepted the continuity, arguing it will expire this year and renewal will not be granted. Huawei launches laptop with AI capabilities On Thursday this week, Huawei launched its first AI capable laptop, the Matebook X Pro, featuring Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 9 processor, sending shockwaves through the US power corridors as lawmakers were angry and got the impression that the latest US tech in the form of new silicon chips was approved by the Commerce Department for Huawei. Elise Stefanike, a Republican Representative, wrote on his handle on the X platform that it (the laptop) \u201cmakes it clear\u201d that the Commerce Department\u2019s approval is the reason Huawei got the new chip. She said, \u201cIt is unacceptable that the Biden administration is actively working to undermine US national security by allowing our greatest strategic adversary access to cutting edge American technology.\u201d The Biden Administration is allowing new U.S. taxpayer funded technology to be exported to the Communist Chinese spy company Huawei which aids the Chinese military. Huawei has been listed on the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Standards Entity List since 2019\u2026 \u2014 Rep. Elise Stefanik (@RepStefanik) April 12, 2024 The commerce department has not yet given any clarification on the matter. According to Reuters, another Republican rep, Michael McCaul, also said in an email, \u201cThese approvals must stop.\u201d Source: Reuters. He also said, \u201cTwo years ago, I was told licenses to Huawei would stop. Today, it doesn\u2019t seem as though the policy has changed.\u201d Source: Reuters. How Americans look at AI in general? When it comes to AI usage in daily life, American people are considered to be more concerned than excited about AI, as Pew research shows that a large chunk of American people, amounting to 37 percent of adults, are more concerned as compared to only 18 percent who are more excited. while a majority of 45 percent are equally concerned and excited. 44 percent of American adults think that driverless passenger cars are a bad idea, while 31 percent think social media companies utilizing artificial intelligence to detect disinformation is also not a good idea. Many Americans also don\u2019t like the idea of facial recognition technology used by police, well this can be a debatable topic, impinging on privacy concerns. Source: PEW How has AI affected American politics? Looking at the deep rooted causes that fuel the animosity, the American desire to trim down China\u2019s emerging position as a global player and to restrict its advancements made in the technological field. If we recall the time when Huawei was placed on the trade restrictions list, that was the time when China announced its launch of 5G technology for the masses, and there was a rage in US politics for them to win the race against the US. America also issued warnings when Asian countries, mostly allied to the US, joined Huawei to launch 5G networks in their countries. Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia were some prominent players who ignored the US warnings of possible security risks associated with it. As Voice of America reported back in the day, some former military personnel were hinting at the potential that 5G with a larger bandwidth will be quite effective for military use and the fact that the US will not be able to use the networks that are tied to Chinese firms in the US allied territories in Asia and Europe. I think it makes it quite clear. Recent steps taken by the US to sideline China from obtaining the latest silicon chips are all part of a broader campaign where the US is restricting its vendors like Nvidia from dealing with Chinese firms and pressurizing companies and investors around the globe to not participate in Chinese artificial intelligence ventures. As recently, the UAE based G42 investments group backed off from its commitments with Chinese firms to applause the US.","article_summary":"Biden\u2019s administration was once again under criticism from lawmakers after Chinese tech giant Huawei released a new laptop model that is powered by the latest Intel chip set.

This bullish prediction comes amidst recent struggles for XRP, which is currently grappling to maintain support above the $0.60 level. Mikybull bases his optimism on two key technical indicators: the two-year moving average (MA) and a symmetrical triangle formation on the two-month chart. XRP recently crossed above the two-year MA, a historical signifier of significant price increases according to the analyst. This pattern held true in late 2017 when XRP skyrocketed to its all-time high of $3.31 after a similar crossover.

Ahmed was also ordered to forfeit the stolen crypto and pay restitution to the affected exchanges. Engineer Exploits Crypto Vulnerabilities In $12 Million Hacks According to charging documents and court filings, Ahmed conducted two separate attacks on decentralized exchanges. In the first incident, which took place on July 2 and 3, 2022, he manipulated fake pricing data to generate approximately $9 million in inflated fees. Subsequently, Ahmed withdrew these fees in the form of cryptocurrency. Following the theft, Ahmed communicated with the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds, except $1.5 million, if the exchange did not involve law enforcement. Shortly after, on July 28, 2022, Ahmed targeted another decentralized exchange called Nirvana Finance. Exploiting a vulnerability in Nirvana\u2019s smart contracts, he purchased crypto assets at a lower price than intended and promptly resold them back to Nirvana at a higher price. Despite Nirvana offering a substantial \u201cbug bounty\u201d of up to $600,000 for the return of the stolen funds, Ahmed demanded $1.4 million. This led to the collapse of the exchange, which had lost all its possessed funds, approximately $3.6 million, due to Ahmed\u2019s attack. From Security Expert To Cybercriminal The investigation revealed that Ahmed used \u201cadvanced money laundering techniques\u201d to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds. These included token swap transactions, transferring fraud proceeds from the Solana (SOL) blockchain to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain through \u201cbridging,\u201d converting the funds to Monero, and then using overseas exchanges and cryptocurrency mixers such as Samourai Whirlpool. Ahmed, a US citizen, held a senior security engineer position at an international technology company at the time of the attacks. His resume showcased expertise in reverse engineering smart contracts and conducting blockchain audits, skills that he utilized to execute the hacks. In addition to the three-year prison term, Ahmed was sentenced to three years of supervised release. He must forfeit approximately $12.3 million, including a significant amount of cryptocurrency, and pay the affected exchanges over $5 million in restitution. Commenting on Shakeeb Ahmed\u2019s sentencing, US Attorney Damian Williams said Today, Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to prison in the first-ever conviction for the hack of a smart contract and ordered to forfeit all of the stolen crypto. No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice.

Allegedly, the companies participated in an elaborate scheme that resulted in the loss of AU$ 160 million, worth $104 million, from investors. ASIC After Unlicensed Mining Companies The Australian regulator commenced civil procedures against the NGS Group companies and their directors, Brett Mendham, Ryan brown, and Mark Ten Caten. The NGS Blockchain crypto mining companies include NGS Crypto, NGS Digital, and NGS Group. ASIC alleges that the NGS companies targeted Australian investors to acquire blockchain mining packages with a fixed-rate return. The regulator also accuses the companies of allegedly encouraging investors to use self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and convert the money into crypto. According to the NGS Crypto website, the company was formed in 2018 as a blockchain firm. As part of the NGS Group, the firm \u201caims to help members generate consistent returns.\u201d The Australian regulator stated in their press release that these financial services are being provided without the proper licensing. Due to this, ASIC is seeking \u201cinterim and final injunctions against the NGS Companies.\u201d ASIC Chair Joe Longo urged Australian users to consider the risks involving self-managing the SMSFs before using the funds to invest in crypto-related investment products like those offered by the NGS Group. Moreover, ASIC\u2019s Chair warned the industry about the regulator\u2019s standard to scrutinize crypto products: These proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinised by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers. The Australian regulator applied to the Federal Court to designate liquidators responsible for the companies\u2019 digital assets. The request was made because the regulator believed the investor\u2019s assets were \u201cat risk of dissipation.\u201d On Wednesday, the court approved the request and prevented Mendham from leaving the country. The preliminary investigations revealed that over 450 Australians invested AU$62 million, approximately $41 million, through the NGS Companies. Crypto Funds Busted For Irregularities Similarly, over 100 investors are owed over AUD$ 100 million, around $64.6 million, by the now-collapsing DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund. Recently, investigations started after investors denounced the crypto funds operated by Ash Balanian, an alleged former NASA mission scientist. As a result, liquidators were appointed to the three companies managed by Balanian. Per the report, the fund was geared at wealthy investors, requiring a minimum deposit of AU$ 50,000. Investors discovered irregularities in the fund\u2019s management, which resulted in the authorities\u2019 involvement. Numerous investors were concerned as they considered that the funds failed to hold the required licenses and \u201cbreached managed investment scheme requirements.\u201d On Wednesday, the Australian Federal Court ordered the freezing of Balanian\u2019s assets, worth AU$55 million, and the crypto fund manager to hand over his passport.","article_summary":"According to local reports, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has started legal procedures against two crypto companies and their directors for operating unlicensed in the country.

There Are Now More Than Five Million Litecoin Long-Term Holders According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the LTC network recently reached a new milestone in terms of its long-term holder count. The \u201clong-term holders\u201d (LTHs) here refer to Bitcoin investors who have held their coins for more than a year without moving or selling them. Note that IntoTheBlock chose this cutoff; other analytics firms have an LTH threshold between 5 and 6 months. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs, who hold for relatively long periods, are considered to carry a strong resolve. Historically, the LTHs rarely show selling activity, regardless of whatever happens in the rest of the market. The fickle-minded part of the sector that holds for relatively low timespans is called the short-term holder (STH) group. Participating STHs in selloffs isn\u2019t uncommon; it happens whenever significant volatility emerges, whether in the form of a rally or crash. On the other hand, it can be a notable event when the LTHs sell. One way to track the behavior of the LTHs is through the total number of addresses that qualify for the cohort. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that reveals the trend in this metric for Litecoin since the start of the year. As displayed in the above graph, the number of Litecoin LTH addresses has grown significantly over the last few months and has now reached the 5 million mark. This means that more than five million LTC wallets haven\u2019t made any move since at least a year ago. This corresponds to 62.5% of all addresses on the blockchain currently carrying some non-zero balance. This is a significant amount and suggests that most of the holder base has been interested in HODLing the cryptocurrency. Naturally, supply staying locked in the wallets of these diamond hands can be bullish due to how supply-demand dynamics tend to play out. Remember that any increases in the LTH addresses don\u2019t imply that HODLers are currently buying Litecoin. Rather, it suggests that some investors acquired coins a year ago, and they have only now been able to qualify for the group. Thus, the metric has a delay of 1 year attached between when accumulation happened and when it registers an increase. Selling doesn\u2019t carry the same restriction, as investors are immediately ejected from the cohort if they transfer their coins on the network. LTC Price Litecoin has continued to trade inside a range recently, as its price is currently floating around $95.","article_summary":"On-chain data shows that Litecoin\u2019s long-term holders have achieved a new record: 62.5% of all LTC investors now qualify as these HODLers.

However, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a conspicuous silence on the matter, speculation has risen on the likelihood of the approval. This speculation is further fuelled by the scarcity of concrete details regarding the approval process, leaving investors and enthusiasts worried and anticipating. Bitcoin Maxi Weighs In Ethereum Spot ETF Approval In the spot Ethereum ETF debate, notable voices from the cryptocurrency space have offered their perspectives. Renowned Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to the president of El Salvador, Max Keiser, has recently expressed skepticism regarding the SEC\u2019s cautious approach to approving an Ethereum ETF. Keiser, known for his staunch advocacy of Bitcoin and skepticism towards alternative cryptocurrencies, dismissed Ethereum as a \u201cproof-of-stake scam,\u201d suggesting it lacks the regulatory backing necessary for SEC approval. The SEC is right not to approve an Ethereum (ETH) ETF It\u2019s a proof-of-stake scam that fails on all requirements the SEC would look for. https://t.co/nLz8boTGtW \u2014 Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) April 11, 2024 Keiser\u2019s sentiment echoes that of Bloomberg\u2019s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, who also recently shared a conservative outlook on the likelihood of an ETH spot ETF receiving regulatory approval. Balchunas estimated the chances of approval at a mere 25%, further fueling uncertainty surrounding the prospect of an Ethereum ETF. Re Eth ETF approval, we are holding the line at 25% odds altho tbh it is a very pessimistic 25%. The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination. No positive signs/intel anywhere you look. Personally hope they do approve it but it just ain\u2019t looking good. https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 25, 2024 Additionally, VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck expressed anticipation of a potential rejection of their Ethereum ETF application, citing prolonged regulatory reviews and lack of clarity from the SEC. Spot ETH ETF Gains Regulatory Interest Overseas Amidst the uncertainty surrounding the US SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum ETFs, reports suggest a contrasting regulatory environment in Hong Kong. According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong regulators may soon approve exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a potential shift in global regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrency investment products. If approved, these ETFs could offer investors new avenues for exposure to the digital asset market. Several firms are poised to launch ETFs pending regulatory clearance from the Securities and Futures Commission. Among the prospective issuers awaiting approval are international arms of Chinese asset manager Harvest Fund Management Co. and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital. Upon receiving regulatory approval, these firms have indicated their intent to launch ETFs investing in BTC and ETH, highlighting the growing demand for cryptocurrency investment products in global markets.
