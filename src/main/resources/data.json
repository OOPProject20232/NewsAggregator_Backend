The price of AXS asset has been displaying bearish behavior and has been declining consistently on the daily chart, indicating a potential further downward trend. The asset\u2019s performance was poor last week and last month, with a drop of -3.59% and -25.95%, respectively, which suggests a stable downtrend. The price of Axie Infinity crypto has significantly dropped in recent times. This decline was evident as the price plunged from a crucial level of approximately $13.50 on the chart. AXS crypto is deteriorating at faster pace, as it meets the resistance level and could dive to new lows from the current price. The Axie Infinity price asset plunged below the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. Likewise, the AXS price asset is displaying bearish characteristics as MACD is below the zero line at -0.73 and the RSI is falling smoothly below the median line at 41.60, implying that the Axie Infinity asset is losing momentum and can achieve new depths in the coming sessions. At press time, the AXS crypto had experienced a 1.99% decline in the last 24 hours to $9.36. Therefore, if the Axie Infinity price fails to stay above the $8.50 level, it could decline further and reach lower lows. However, if the demand for the crypto remains high, the AXS asset price could bounce back from the current level by surpassing the below trendline. The next goal for Axie Infinity is to reach $11.0 and $12.0. AXS Volume Analysis Upon examining the AXS chart, it becomes evident that there was a surge in trading volume on or around March 10th, 2024. This increase in volume suggests that there was a notable uptick in both interest and market activity regarding the Axie Infinity token at that particular moment in time. It is worth noting that the volume had previously surpassed the $600 Million mark. However, from March 11th, 2024 onwards, volume continued to fall, and a significant descent in AXS activity was observed which illustrated decreased demand and excitement about Axie Infinity price. The trading volume depleted from $600 Million to the low of $250 Million by April 8th on the chart. AXS Crypto Active Addresses Declining The count of active addresses in the AXS refers to the number of unique addresses of Axie Infinity users who have participated in one or more transactions within a specific timeframe.

This data indicates that the number of people who are involved in using and trading the AXS is decreasing. As a result, the demand and value for the Axie Infinity price may also be decreasing due to the decreasing number of active addresses over time. These terms are used to highlight the short-term and long-term trends of AXS crypto\u2019s activity and its adoption. Summary The AXS asset price is falling, showing bearish signs on the daily chart. Last week and last month saw poor performances with drops of 3.59% and 25.95%, indicating a stable downtrend.

NASA and SpaceX astronauts are utilizing the metaverse to undergo training, for life on a space station known as \u201cGateway,\u201d which is currently in the works. This space station is envisioned as a cutting-edge science laboratory solar-powered spacecraft and a home away from home for astronauts from around the world as detailed in a blog article by NASA. How Metaverse Is Changing The Cosmo Game In the past astronauts typically trained for missions using computer-based simulators. However with the advent of virtual reality headsets and advanced spatial computing technologies astronauts now have the opportunity to acquire the skills to operate and thrive in an immersive 3D environment. The initial inhabitants of space will be the team for managing Gateway, which is being established as a crucial site for the Artemis program. The goal of this U.S.-led endeavor is to construct a manned outpost on the Moon. This will be part of humanity\u2019s mission to send a human to Mars. Gateway plays a role in the Artemis missions According to NASA Gateway plays a role in the Artemis missions. Will serve as a versatile outpost orbiting the Moon. It will offer support for surface expeditions serve as a hub for scientific endeavors and acts as a launching point for further exploration, into deep space. As per NASA, the astronauts assigned to the Gateway project will encounter the mission of becoming the crew of an orbital space station in deep space situated at a distance of around 386,243 kilometers from Earth. In contrast, astronauts aboard the International Space Station typically work at a distance of 400 kilometers, from Earth. NASA Planning to Utilize Blockchain Technology NASA is teaming up with Lonestar and the Isle of Man to use blockchain technology for verifying and securing data storage on the moon during the upcoming Artemis missions. Blockchain will be used to provide irrefutable proof of human landing on the moon during NASA\u2019s Artemis 3 mission in 2025. Before that, Artemis 2 will launch in November 2024 with a crewed mission to orbit the moon and return to Earth. As one of the scientific missions during the Artemis voyages, Lonestar and the Isle of Man will develop lunar storage systems that rely on solar power and require no additional infrastructure. According to Roosen, the head of innovation at Digital Isle of Man, the island\u2019s government-funded agency that supports its tech sector, \u201cpeople often tell NASA: \u2018You made up the moon missions,\u2019 and proving that they\u2019re actually there is surprisingly difficult.\u201d How Blockchain Is Useful To NASA? Blockchain technology\u2019s immutability is reliable for recording and verifying future lunar missions. This would provide real-time check-in mechanisms for lunar exploration and indisputable evidence of human presence on the moon\u2019s surface, helping NASA dispel any conspiracy theories surrounding lunar landings. This project marks a significant milestone in the evolving relationship between blockchain technology and space exploration, as blockchain-verified data storage solutions could authenticate historical space achievements and future lunar activities as NASA\u2019s Artemis program progresses.

The issues related to security & scalability have persisted in the blockchain technology since its launch and require an effective solution. Chainlink (LINK), a decentralized blockchain oracle network streaming on Ethereum, introduced a new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019 for safer data transfer. The Bridge app is available on a few of the blockchains including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, etc. Chainlink\u2019s New Bridge App Details On Thursday, April 11, to mitigate the challenge of security, Chainlink introduced a new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019 for safer data and value transfer. The new application will permit users to transfer the tokens and data across different blockchains without any security concerns and is available for individuals and institutions. The aim is to offer the best and most cost-effective way to make high-value token transfers effortless and secure. The new bridge was developed on Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) technology, which is mainly used by SWIFT for shifting large token volumes and messages to other networks in a safe way. Additionally, the technology is used by banks for international money transfers. Apart from top-notch security, the platform also supports real-time visual tracking to check the status of transfers between blockchains. The platform charges the regular fee for using the technology and includes the cost of executing the transaction on different blockchains and fees paid to CCIP service providers. The Transporter application is currently available for blockchains including Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and WEMIX. Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of Chainlink addressed the new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019. \u201cHaving a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years,\u201d, Nazarov added. Bridges play a crucial role in interconnecting the individual blockchain rails, permitting the transaction of value and data in between. According to DefiLlama data, the existing bridges have transferred around across different chains last month. However, all these bridges are the targets of exploits and hacks, holding chances of user data loss. Chainlink\u2019s Upcoming Events Chainlink is a platform connecting the world of blockchains and is actively engaged in innovations and inventions. After the launch of \u2018Transporter,\u2019 the platform is ready to work on its upcoming projects like Chainlink SmartCon and Introducing the Chainlink Block Magic Hackathon. Chainlink SmartCon is an event going to be organized in Hong Kong between October 30 and 31, 2024. The event involves digital asset leaders, DeFi pioneers, and on-chain builders who will come together to discuss technological topics and invent the future of global markets. Another upcoming event on Chainlink is Block Magic, which is going to be organized from April to June and involves different events like Chainlink Bootcamp, workshops, Hackathon kick-off, and Project submission deadline. According to CoinMarketCap data, Chainlink is currently trading at $17.44 after an upsurge of 0.64% in the past 1 day and has a market cap of $10,236,002,394. The coin has a 24-volume of $277,908,962, a maximum supply of 1 Million, and a circulating supply of 587,099,970.","article_summary":"Chainlink, a platform connecting public and private blockchains has launched a new bridge app \u2018Transporter\u2019 for making data and value transactions safer.

John Deaton\u2019s Campaign Fundraising As reported by Eleanor Terret of Fox Business, the lawyer-turned-senate hopeful raised $1.36 million for his campaign Q1, compared to Warren\u2019s $1.1 million. \u201cAccording to his campaign, Deaton has received donations from prominent figures in the crypto industry such as Ripple execs Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Charles Hoskinson, Jameson Lopp, and Anthony Scaramucci,\u201d Terret wrote to X on Friday. According to Politico, donors including Garlinghouse, Larsen, Scaramucci, and the Winklevoss twins put down the maximum donations of $6600 for his campaign. NEW: According to the Federal Election Commission, @DeatonforSenate outraised @SenWarren in the first quarter with Deaton raising total revenues of $1.36M and Warren $1.1M. According to his campaign, Deaton has received donations from prominent figures in the #crypto industry\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 12, 2024 Deaton\u2019s large, largely corporate funding is as foretold by Warren, who issued warnings to her followers in February in anticipation of Deaton\u2019s campaign announcement. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, but this now means we need to prepare to compete against funding from powerful special interests, Wall Street, and the GOP,\u201d she said at the time. Deaton\u2019s history with the crypto industry is no secret. He\u2019s best known for representing 75,000 XRP holders in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that closed last year, which mostly panned out in Ripple\u2019s favor. He\u2019s also blasted the SEC for harshly treating the crypto industry in several other high-profile lawsuits, including its fight with Grayscale \u2013 the issuer of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF. The result of that lawsuit ultimately forced the SEC into allowing Bitcoin spot ETFs to trade, which Elizabeth Warren loudly disapproved of. Is Elizabeth Warren Worried? Beyond crypto, Warren and Deaton fiercely disagree on other partisan topics: student loan forgiveness, the migrant crisis, and loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. \u201cI\u2019ve beaten the odds as an underdog my entire life and I\u2019m going to do it again.

Israel is braced for a counterattack from Iran after they recently took out IRGC military leaders in Syria. Reports emerged on Friday that the US is moving warships to ready itself to defend Israel. JUST IN: The United States has pledged to DEFEND ISRAEL if Iran attacks. Iran has stated this will make the US a target of Iran. pic.twitter.com/Esn0bPXWFX \u2014 Jackson Hinkle (@jacksonhinklle) April 12, 2024 Tensions have been high in the Middle East since the October 7th Hamas attack against Israel, and Israel\u2019s devastating counterattack into Gaza. Bitcoin was a relative safe haven versus most of the market, dropping just 4.5% to $67,000. That leaves it still only about 9% down from its recent record highs near $74,000. With Bitcoin increasingly viewed as a form of digital gold, it could even rally if Iran/Israel/US tensions rise further. But with the halving around the corner and Fed rate cut bets fading, investors may remain reluctant to pile in. They may instead be eyeing up opportunities in the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain shitcoin markets. On-chain markets refer to the market for tokens that are issued directly onto blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. The name \u201cshitcoin\u201d refer to the fact that most of these tokens are scams, pump-and-dumps, or lacking in real utility. But on-chain shitcoin markets are also one of the only places where traders are able to secure gains of 10x or more in under 24 hours. Here are the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be watching, as per DEXTools. As a reminder, potential investors should always do their own research into tokens and never risk more than they can afford to lose. Top Crypto Gainers Today 42 times 10 (420) A just-launched meme coin called 42 times 10 (420) is up 1,750% on Friday, as per DEXTools. Despite these big gains, the token\u2019s market cap was last around $150,000, with only around $40,000 in liquidity. The token also still has less than 100 holders and only saw $28,000 in trading volumes over the past 24 hours. As per DEXTools\u2019 smart contract audit, the token has three concerning aspects to its smart contract. Traders should be very careful with this highly illiquid shitcoin. WojakPepe (WOPE) A new hybrid version of the Pepe and Wojak meme coins called WojakPepe (WOPE) is up 550% on Friday. That\u2019s as per DEXTools, who puts the token\u2019s market cap at $1 million and liquidity at $100,000. The token last had just over 550 holders and 24 hour trading volumes of $6,2 million. Not bad for a first day of trade. That being said, the token has two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools. The utility of the token also isn\u2019t clear. So traders should be very cautious with this shitcoin. pepcoin (PEP) A new meme coin claimed to be the \u201cretard cousin ov Pepe\u201d called pepcoin (PEP) is up 1,150% on Friday. But, as per DEXTools, it market cap was last only around $60,000 with $25,000 in liquidity and 220 holders. That means a very small volume of sales could trigger a huge price crash. Traders should be very cautious of such an illiquid coin. A Better Way to Make Quick Gains Shitcoins offer the prospect of quick gains, but are very risky. That\u2019s not just due to their illiquidity and volatility. Its also due to the fact that most are scams of some sort, or pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project\u2019s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first. Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects. Here are their 18 favorite presales right now. See the 18 Crypto Presales Alternatively, check out this video from Cryptonews\u2019 Crypto Arjay who discusses some of the best presales right now.

XRP fell as much as 16% at its lows to around $0.51, which marked new two-month lows. The latest XRP price collapse means it has now reversed 27% lower versus its 2024 highs. The XRP price has dropped back over 25% from its recent highs / Source: TradingView And XRP price predictions could be about to get a lot more bearish. XRP Price Prediction \u2013 Recovery to $1 Incoming? With XRP now sharply below its major moving averages, focus is turning to a test of a long-term uptrend. Indeed, the XRP price has followed an uptrend going all the way back to its early 2023 lows. Should this uptrend break, a short-term retest of support in the $0.43-46 area. Even a break under $0.40 could be on the cards. XRP price predictions would get very bearish if it broke below this long-term uptrend / Source: TradingView Of course, assuming the broader market is in a bullish phase, such a dip would probably be bought into. But whether a recovery to $1 is incoming remains difficult to predict. Ripple Labs maintains winning momentum in its lawsuit versus the SEC. A judge ruled last year that Ripple Labs\u2019 sales of XRP didn\u2019t necessarily constitute a security transaction. And Ripple Labs predicts that its winning momentum will encourage banks to begin using its XRP-powered global payments solution. That could substantially boost XRP\u2019s adoption. That being said, concerns remain about XRP\u2019s lack of decentralization. Moreover, many are concerned that XRP lacks a major use case, when compared to other major cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The former is increasingly viewed as digital gold, while the latter two are fast-growing smart-contract blockchains and the homes of fast-growing decentralized finance and application ecosystems. Crypto Alternatives to Consider XRP investors would be right to be concerned about the cryptocurrency\u2019s near-term price risks. Sometimes traders hunting quick gains often turn to the shitcoin markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project\u2019s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first. Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects. Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.

However, the renowned author reiterated that investors should always choose what is best for them, noting that his stance against Bitcoin ETFs works best for him. If he makes a mistake, he has no one else to blame but himself, he noted. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETFs market is at an all-time high, with tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) picking up pace. CoinShares data showed that cryptocurrency investment products, including Bitcoin ETFs, have recorded positive inflows of late. Total inflows were $646 million on April 8, and the year-to-date (YTD) inflow was $13.8B, the highest volume ever recorded. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, predicted an upward shift towards the tokenization of RWAs, such as bonds issued on blockchains, during a Chainalysis Links Conference held in New York.

Some, like Arbitrum and Bonk, are down over 50% from yearly highs. Indeed, it had already been an ugly few weeks for most alternative cryptocurrency prices, even prior to Friday\u2019s sharp. After a strong finish to 2023/start to 2024 that saw many major altcoins posting 2-3x or more gains, as well as Bitcoin recovering to new record highs, momentum has stalled, and profit-taking has taken over. Jitters about a Bitcoin halving related turbulence, fading Fed rate cut bets and geopolitics have added fresh reasons to derisk. Where Next For Cryptocurrency Prices? It remains far too early to say definitively that the latest drop in cryptocurrency prices is over. After all, there remains plenty of room left for escalation between Iran and Israel. The altcoin pullback presents a great opportunity for investors to get in at bargain prices versus a few weeks ago. But anyone jumping into the market now should be ready for significant two-way volatility. Or, if they fancy buying a crypto that carries a much lower risk of near-term 15% intra-day moves, there\u2019s Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin has dropped 5% in 24 hours on risk off flows. But trading in the $67,000s, BTC is only down 8% from the record highs it hit near $74,000 last month. Moreover, it remains locked well within recent ranges. That could reflect the fact that many view Bitcoin to actually be a safe haven asset, much like gold. And its general resilience in recent weeks could reflect a reluctance to sell ahead of the halving/amid ETF optimism. While a article-halving \u201csell-the-fact\u201d reaction could see Bitcoin dip back towards the $60,000s, its outlook remains strong. Prior halvings have typically been followed by huge price run-ups to fresh record levels within a few months. Big US deficit spending and global central bank easing suggests that macro will remain a tailwind. That\u2019s even if the Fed is comparatively slow to begin cutting rates, amid robust US data. And finally, institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has added a new, long-term source of buy pressure to the market. $100,000 Bitcoin for later this year remains very much on the cards. Bitcoin could dip back to $60,000 amid a broad downturn in cryptocurrency prices / Source: TradingView And that suggests that, while the near-term altcoin outlook is bumpy, traders should brace for strong comebacks later this year.

The stablecoin market has also grown more competitive. For example, XRP issuer Ripple recently announced plans to launch a United States dollar-backed stablecoin. Launching a stablecoin is a natural step for Ripple as we bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto.

The supply of Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC expanded by nearly $10 billion combined over the past month. Is The Bull Market Driving Stablecoin Demand? Interestingly, increasing demand for stablecoins coincides with the current crypto bull market. Yet while stablecoin growth may be correlated with increasing cryptocurrency prices, industry experts believe demand for digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar are surging for other reasons. Austin Campbell, Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, told Cryptonews that while there is a correlation between stablecoins and the wider crypto market cap, it has been declining over time. \u201cIt appears that stablecoins are being used independently of crypto trading for payments,\u201d said Campbell. He added that dollar-backed stablecoins are addressing a broader market segment compared to digital assets solely used for speculation. Stablecoin Use Cases For Payments On The Rise Their utility may be increasing as well, as a number of stablecoin payment use cases are coming to fruition. For example, David Uhryniak, Head of TRON Ecosystem Development, told Cryptonews that an app called Grab \u2013 known as the \u201cUber of Singapore\u201d \u2013 recently began accepting USDT on TRON for payments. \u201cTRC20-USDT holders can now pay for their rides or food delivery directly without converting to fiat currency,\u201d said Uhryniak. \u201cI expect a growing trend where more international e-commerce platforms will integrate with TRON to accept crypto transactions for everyday services.\u201d According to Uhryniak, the TRON blockchain has become one of the preferred transport layers for popular stablecoins like USDT due to its low transaction fees and fast processing. \u201cTRON has the highest circulating supply of USDT, at over $54.8 billion,\u201d said Uhryniak. \u201cSince early February of this year, USDT on TRON has been averaging over 2 million transactions daily.\u201d Jelena Djuric, CEO and Co-Founder of digital asset issuance chain Noble, told Cryptonews that while stablecoins can be used for decentralized finance (DeFi), the platform has recently seen a surge in stablecoins for payments. \u201cAn example of this is being seen with Cypher Wallet, where users can load USDC from Noble and spend those dollars in stores wherever Mastercard is accepted,\u201d said Djuric. Djuric added that she believes the most interesting stablecoin use cases currently focus on digital dollars. \u201cStablecoins are more convenient, efficient and scalable than the traditional financial rails,\u201d she said. Djuric shared that Noble is currently handling $1 billion of volume per month of USDC transactions from the platform to other Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol chains. \u201cWe have grown USDC issuance more than most other native issuance chains for the past few months. This represents real adoption by users and Dapp chains that plug into Noble for liquidity,\u201d said Djuric. Massimiliano Silenzi, CEO of research firm Cryptorefills Labs, told Cryptonews that recent findings from Cryptorefills show almost 80 percent of crypto-shoppers prefer to pay for goods and services with stablecoins versus other cryptocurrencies. Source: Cryptorefills While notable, Silenzi pointed out that due to transaction speeds and fees, only one-sixth of stablecoin payments take place on the Ethereum mainnet. \u201cThe majority of stablecoin payments are dispersed fairly evenly across alternative networks like Polygon, TRON, Solana, and Avalanche as well as Ethereum layer-2s like Optimism and Arbitrum,\u201d said Silenzi. \u201cAs a result, when it comes to stablecoin payment networks that are quick, inexpensive, and scalable, there isn\u2019t yet a clear winner.\u201d Challenges May Hamper Stablecoin Adoption While it\u2019s notable that stablecoin adoption may be increasing due to real-world payment use cases, regulations and other concerns may slow adoption. For instance, while stablecoin legislation may get passed this year in the U.S., Senator Elizabeth Warren recently criticized the proposed stablecoin bill. As Cryptonews previously reported, Warren argues that creating new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins could \u201camplify and entrench\u201d risks they pose to the American banking sector. Moreover, David Pope, Commissioner of The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, told Cryptonews that tax rules around stablecoins remain a barrier to adoption as well. \u201cThe IRS views all crypto (including Stablecoins) as property (as opposed to cash),\u201d said Pope. \u201cThis means whenever a US person or entity uses a stablecoin for anything, it has to be reported on their tax return (even though there is normally no gain or loss).\u201d Pope believes that if stablecoins become commonly used, this will likely result in thousands of transactions needing to be documented. In addition to regulations, Djuric believes that non-crypto natives still struggle with Web3 concepts such as private keys, wallets, on-ramps, bridged versions of the same stablecoins, and more. \u201cNoble is trying to solve all of these challenges, but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Eventually, we should see chain and asset abstraction as secure but highly intuitive wallet interfaces,\u201d she said. Indeed, these challenges may eventually lead to decreasing demand in stablecoins. For instance, Paxos\u2019 most recent transparency report on PayPal USD noted the circulation of PYUSD in March totaled $188.5 million. This marks a 39% decrease in PayPal\u2019s stablecoin compared to the previous month. Ways To Ensure Stablecoin Growth Moving Forward Challenges aside, Campbell believes that stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto space matures. \u201cStablecoins will probably outgrow DeFi and become a tool for real-world payments around the globe,\u201d he said. Although adoption may be slow, education, along with retail demand for stablecoins, will ensure growth in the future. Notably, Tether is already taking steps to provide better stablecoin education. On April 10, Tether announced a partnership with Coins.ph \u2013 a popular digital asset exchange in the Philippines \u2013 to promote financial education for blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and stablecoins in the region. According to a Tether blog article, the educational initiatives being launched will target diverse segments of the Filipino population. This includes finance professionals like bankers and fintech companies, but also overseas Filipino workers seeking efficient remittance solutions. Pope also believes that as the general public moves through the learning curve, retail demand for stablecoins will increase. \u201cThis all suggests that stablecoins are slowly being adopted,\u201d he said. \u201cBut can anyone buy their cup of morning coffee with them yet?

Bitcoin ETFs Show Strong Inflows Since Launch Since the year began, Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to a resurgence in the cryptocurrency markets. By mid-April, the total assets under management for the 11 ETFs are projected to reach a record $73 billion, with $59 billion raised to date.

This concern was outlined in a paper presented by Cardell during an Antitrust Law Spring Meeting in Washington on April 11. UK Competition and Markets Authority Concerned over Potential Market Exploitation Cardell, head of the regulatory body, has expressed concern that Big Tech investments in the artificial intelligence sector could stifle competition. \u201cThe essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We\u2019re committed to applying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at our disposal \u2013 now and in the future \u2013 to ensure that this transformational and structurally critical technology delivers on its promise,\u201d Cardell explained. According to the CMA boss, there\u2019s an \u201cinterconnected web of over 90 partnerships and strategic investments involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia (the leading supplier of AI accelerator chips).\u201d We\u2019ve outlined our growing concerns in the #AI #foundationmodels market, including 3 key interlinked risks to fair, open and effective competition.

The CMA chief outlines three specific dangers: Control over inputs: Big Tech could gain control of essential AI inputs like data and specialized chips. Limiting choice: Companies could leverage existing market power to limit user options for AI services. Anti-competitive alliances: These tech giants could form partnerships explicitly to concentrate market power and hinder innovation. Big Tech Firms Invest Massively In Artificial Intelligence Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have invested billions in AI development, hiring top talent and building products for vast user bases. Microsoft\u2019s backing of OpenAI (the creators of ChatGPT and leading model GPT-4) is a prime example. These investments, while fueling progress, also solidify their positions as gatekeepers within the industry. The CMA recognizes the potential benefits of AI and the expertise these corporations possess. However, Cardell worries that smaller companies could be squeezed out if the current trend continues.

Bitcoin to $80,000 Next? That means Bitcoin has been forming a bullish ascending triangle structure. Such structures generally form ahead of bullish breakouts.

But such a retracement wouldn\u2019t snap the thesis that BTC remains in a bull market. Throughout its history, within a few months of the halving, Bitcoin has always pumped to new record highs. Add to that picture that the US continues to run a big deficit, that rate cuts are coming sooner or later, that ETF demand should continue to act as a long-term tailwind, and that the 2024 Presidential election could see the US political and regulatory landscape shift in a more pro-crypto direction, $100,000 remains on the cards for later this year.

Best Crypto to Buy Now BitTorrent (BTT) BitTorrent (BTT) is one of the few cryptos trading in the green on Friday as the BTC price turns lower.

Cronos (CRO) Crypto.com\u2019s EVM-compatible blockchain Cronos (CRO) is another crypto holding up well on Friday. It was last trading with gains of roughly 2% in the past 24 hours near $0.15, as per CoinMarketCap. Its low market cap of under $4 billion, despite its link to one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, suggests plenty of room left for growth this bull market. With 5x gains possible, CRO could be the best crypto to buy now. BNB (BNB) The world\u2019s fourth-largest crypto BNB (BNB) is another strong performer on Friday, also up 2% in 24 hours. As per CoinMarketCap, BNB was last trading just above $610, with its market cap hovering around $91.5 billion. Like Bitcoin, BNB is forming an ascending triangle and could be about to pump higher. Its record highs around $700 could soon come into play. Like Bitcoin, BNB is forming an ascending triangle and could be about to pump higher. Its record highs around $700 could soon come into play.

Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer investors the opportunity to potentially make quick gains. But some traders are on the lookout for much faster gains than major altcoins can offer. These traders often turn to the shitcoin markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project\u2019s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first.

TAO Price Falls After Binance Listing as Spotlight Shifts to Solana\u2019s Hidden New Coin","author":"Tim Hakki","article_detailed_content":"Cutting edge AI token Bittensor (TAO) has fallen 20% in 24 hours to trade at $572, only a day after listing on Binance in what looks like \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the news\u201d trading activity, according to data by Coin Gecko. Bittensor is a pioneering peer-to-peer (p2p) machine learning protocol that incentivizes participants to train machine learners across a global decentralized network of nodes. By spreading the computing load across multiple nodes, the Bittensor team hopes to create a collaborative and open-source AI training ecosystem that will rival the more centralized machine learning systems used by corporations like Google and IBM. Bittensor employs a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. PoI is an alternative to Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) model, where the nodes with the most computing power validate the most transactions and mine the most BTC. It also differs to the Proof-of-Stake model used by Ethereum, where the nodes that staked the most ETH validate the most transactions. Bittensor is currently the number one AI-related cryptocurrency with a market cap of nearly $4 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of just over $230k. Is it too late to buy AI token Bittensor (TAO)? Given the sudden price drop, it\u2019s definitely not too late to buy TAO. TAO is frontrunning an AI token sector that will rise to prominence in the coming years once tech companies in jurisdictions across the world are confident about both crypto and AI regulation. In fact, some would argue the depreciation is welcome because it offers new buyers a chance to get in at a discount ahead of a potential future rally. However, Bittensor\u2019s trading chart has followed a slightly different narrative to more mainstream cryptocurrencies over the last three months. While, broadly speaking, the price has gone up over the period examined, it has not moved in tandem with the rest of the market. According to the trading chart, the transition from February to March was more volatile for TAO than more leading cryptocurrencies. Having said that, the token has found strong support around $600 and is only trading 22% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of $757.60 set a month ago, March 8. Source: TradingView However, TAO\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44 and falling, which indicates there could be further losses over the next 24 hours. Beyond AI Tokens Like TAO: Solana Meme Coins are Worth Watching If AI related tokens and protocols are undoubtedly the blockchain\u2019s next technological leap, then Solana meme coins are its next cultural one. Bittensor is a good, solid cryptocurrency to invest in. Sure, it has its risks. As with all cryptocurrency investments, people should only invest what they\u2019re prepared to lose, but Bittensor\u2019s Proof-of-Intelligence concept and decentralized AI-training model are revolutionary USPs for any token. Meme coins are another promising sector and Solana meme coins are some of the buzziest right now. The network\u2019s latest star is a 420-friendly sloth with big dreams. In just three weeks, traders have poured well over $10 million into an ICO for new Solana meme coin Slothana ($SLOTH) to try and recapture some of the early upside potential of recently profitable Solana funny tokens like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk. Slothana isn\u2019t lazy, although he certainly appears that way. High on ambition (and surreptitious toking), he\u2019s eyeing the clock hands, waiting for 4:20 because from there, he hopes to get to $420 million. Word on the grapevine says Slothana is by the same team that launched Smog (SMOG), which rallied strongly after ending its presale and listing. Early investors hope to capture that explosive upside potential ahead of a Slothana listing. The clock is ticking and the $SLOTH team has not confirmed launch dates, so the presale window duration is an enigma. Got FOMO?

For those wondering, yes I am running the @shork_coin twitter All off good vibes, no current position (will change likely) You are in good hands frens Lets #shork \u2014 Gannon Breslin (@gannonbreslin) April 12, 2024 The SHORK token appears to have been created by serial founder Gannon Breslin, an associate of the HeniousPumps newsletter. SHORK Price Analysis: Is Shork Coin On The Verge of a Second Rally Leg? As price action pushes to the upside once more, SHORK is currently trading at a market price of $0.035 (representing a 24-hour change of +15,030%). This comes after the token launched at just Midnight UTC in a DEX listing on Raydium. It gained almost instant traction, and its price surged +10,000% in the first three hours. Resistance at $0.062 sent the price tumbling into a strong consolidation pattern above lower support at $0.0225, setting the stage for a further push to SHORK\u2019s current all-time high at $0.067. Yet, with the all-time high delivering +50,000% returns to SHORK holders, early-backed moved for a quickfire sell-off around 6 AM UTC \u2013 sending the price tumbling back to support. However, defying expectations, the support level has once again been successfully defended by holders \u2013 and SHORK price is once again on the climb \u2013 teasing the potential of a second rally leg. The volatile price action has been fuelled by significant interest from retail investors, represented by an impressive $58m in 24-hour trading volume. Now standing at a $41m market cap, interest threatens to wane, with the prospect of a major return for late-stage investors diminished to a generous 5x expectation at these levels. Remarkably, despite more than 8,000 holders, bulls remain in control \u2013 with buy pressure representing 51% of transactions over the past hour.

He talked about his gradual and intentional switch from a professional sports player to a crypto entrepreneur, accepting Bitcoin as salary seven years ago, establishing a staking-as-a-service, and chains coming to Myrmidon soon. Rosenthal told us why ETFs are useful but go against the basic crypto ethos, and how Myrmidon ensures true coin ownership. Lastly, he discussed the pros and cons of the four staking types: which one is the most difficult but most beneficial earning-wise and which one is the least. In this interview, Rosenthal discussed: being the first athlete to accept BTC as salary in 2017; Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider; what\u2019s going on with Ethereum; the implications of Ethereum ETF; solo-home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking. You can watch what Rosenthal told Matt in the video above or read it below. From Hokey Player to Crypto Player There\u2019s a pattern in the world of sports, Rosenthal said. Players retire and then feel like they\u2019ve lost their identity. They struggle to live outside the sports world. Rosenthal didn\u2019t want this happening to him, so he started spreading out career-wise early on. Being a pro hockey player in the US or Canada pays very well. In Europe, too, a player can \u201cmake a pretty good living.\u201d But making money article-retirement is difficult. Rosenthal returned from the US to Europe, well aware that his career would come to its inevitable end. Therefore, he went to study and earn his degrees from the Copenhagen Business School. Also, in 2016, he fell \u201cdeep down the rabbit hole\u201d of crypto through Danish Bitcoin entrepreneur Niklas Nikolajsen, who founded Bitcoin Suisse AG in 2013. This path ultimately led to Rosenthal becoming the first athlete to accept Bitcoin as a salary in 2017. Many would certainly think this a very strange and/or bad financial decision at the time. Bitcoin and the world of crypto were very different seven years ago, and they were perceived differently in the mainstream. But it turned out to be an excellent decision, and there are multiple athletes today accepting their salary in crypto. And \u201cI definitely orange-pilled a couple of boys, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Rosenthal said. He noted how relative the term \u2018early\u2019 is. In 2016 he used to think of those who had gotten into the space in 2015 or 2013 as being early. But now that he looks back, he was early too. Anybody who gets in today will likely be \u2018early\u2019 for somebody entering the space in 2030, let\u2019s say. No Competitor for Ethereum Yet Rosenthal eventually went on to co-found Myrmidon in 2022. It\u2019s a non-custodial staking provider primarily focused on Ethereum. The CEO commented that \u201ctoday, Ethereum is still the biggest L1 chain out there.\u201d There are some layer-1 blockchains competing with it, including Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. But \u201cthe bottom line is that Ethereum is still the one to beat, in my view,\u201d Rosenthal remarked. Since the last time Rosenthal was a guest at Cryptonews Podcast back in 2021, Ethereum has undergone a number of major upgrades. And \u201ceverything went smoothly,\u201d he said. Congratulations to the entire #Ethereum community on a succesful Dencun upgrade on epoch 269,568. Here are some of the most important things you need to know about the upgrade : pic.twitter.com/zQbYLS0ELg \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) March 14, 2024 An issue, Rosenthal argued, is that some people may not understand what an update is supposed to do, expecting it to do something else \u2013 for example, lower the fees, which are a major pain point for Ethereum. A negative narrative is then created around the chain when an upgrade doesn\u2019t do what it wasn\u2019t supposed to do in the first place. Though he doesn\u2019t fully understand why there has been so much negativity recently directed at Ethereum, Rosenthal remarked that it does follow historical patterns of \u201cETH getting hammered, Bitcoin taking off.\u201d The latter is up primarily because of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval is the US. And Ethereum ETFs are expected to follow. And while personally he doesn\u2019t \u201creally care about the ETF,\u201d the entrepreneur finds it beneficial for adoption. That said, \u201clong-term, ETH ETF or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter for the adoption of ETH because I can\u2019t really see a competitor to ETH as it is right now,\u201d Rosenthal opined. Case Against ETF and For True Ownership Going deeper into the ETF argument, Rosenthal argued that \u201cit\u2019s a great product for the average person out there.\u201d It\u2019s an easy way to enter the space and get exposure to the asset class. But there is a big \u2018but\u2019. It\u2019s counter-crypto. Crypto, Rosenthal says, was invented for people to custody their own assets and always maintain full control. The Bitcoin ETF is, by default, not a product that allows this. People make different choices when managing their assets. And it likely can\u2019t be expected that everybody will self-custody. However, \u201cfor me, the underlying asset and owning the underlying asset is really what matters,\u201d Rosenthal said. This is why the Myrmidon team made the non-custodial solution, Ethereum Staking Dashboard, enabling people to easily stake their ETH without losing control over it. The stakers don\u2019t give up their keys, and they also earn yield. There is a saying in #crypto \u2013 \"Not your keys, not your coins\" That's why we're all about native non-custodial #Ethereum staking So why pick us? 1\u20e3 You have 100% validator control 2\u20e3 0% protocol rewards fee 3\u20e3 100% native staking Get started todayhttps://t.co/NaG7pWH6Og pic.twitter.com/JDHoHzUJm8 \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) February 14, 2024 Notably, Rosenthal explained, Ethereum staking is a bit different. Most proof-of-stake blockchains use delegation: for example, you delegate ADA or SOL to the stake provider. However, if you want to stake your ETH, you have to make a transaction to the Beacon chain, and if you want to get the ETH back, you have to send the correct data to unlock it, the entrepreneur said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated process,\u201d Rosenthal opined. And because it\u2019s difficult for many to understand, they turn to centralized exchanges. This choice comes with its own set of security risks. Therefore, Myrmidon enabled people to stake their ETH, maintain ownership over it, and exit the staking position easily. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a friendly UI for ETH staking, which is not very UI-friendly,\u201d Rosenthal said. The downside of Myrmidon\u2019s service is that it must support native ETH staking, which means that users must stake 32 ETH per validator. That said, \u201cas of yet, we haven\u2019t found one single provider [besides Myrmidon] who can safely say that they are truly non-custodial staking providers.\u201d Hence, unlike Myrmidon, should something happen with the provider, the users\u2019 ETH is gone forever. The Four Staking Categories: Pros and Cons Rosenthal went on to discuss the four categories of staking. These are solo home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking. He explained that we can observe these categories as listed from the most to the least decentralized, from the most difficult to the easiest, and from the most secure to the least secure. Solo home staking is the hardest and requires the most knowledge and work, given the constant updates. But it\u2019s also the most decentralized, the most secure, and the most rewarding. Staking-as-a-service is what Myrmidon does. It\u2019s a very decentralized way to stake ETH, and it\u2019s also not easy. However, if you know how to operate a wallet, you can choose this option. Did you know #MyrmidonStaking offers a user-friendly platform for staking #Ethereum kinda like the launchpad? It's actually more like a dashboard and launchpad in one built right into our staking solution, which is 100% non-custodial No messing around with extra smart\u2026 pic.twitter.com/RvkXnncsyx \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) April 9, 2024 Pool staking is a very popular solution. For one, it doesn\u2019t require 32 ETH, but only 0.1 ETH. It\u2019s easy and convenient. But the big issues are smart contract risk and centralization. The final option is the easiest and the riskiest one: centralized staking. Here, the centralized exchanges do the work for you. They don\u2019t require 32 ETH either. At the same time, stakers give up control over their assets. Furthermore, the yield gets significantly lower as you go further down the list. For example, those who use staking-as-a-service, get all base rewards, hence they earn more. More Chains Incoming The Myrmidon team has so far primarily been focused on Ethereum. However, that\u2019s not to say they haven\u2019t worked with other chains or started planning support for additional chains. \u201cYou should definitely check our website because we\u2019re going to pop up new networks over course of 2024,\u201d Rosenthal said. Just recently, the team launched Cardano, which is \u201coff to a great start.\u201d Users can now delegate their ADA coins via Myrmidon. Hey #CardanoCommunity We are live with our cardano stake pool Name: Myrmidon Ticker: MYR Fixed cost: 170\u20b3 Margin: 5% Some facts about #MyrmidonStaking (us) 1\u20e3 We host our nodes in house 2\u20e3 We are a non-custodial staking service provider 3\u20e3 We are a team of 5 people\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5myTN1ag2D \u2014 Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) April 3, 2024 They are also live with the Danish-founded blockchain Concordium. \u201cWe run the largest pool as a third-party provider for that ecosystem,\u201d said Rosenthal. Therefore, the company supports three networks currently, while the fourth \u2013 Fleek \u2013 is expected to go live this summer, in Q3. Myrmidon will not launch any chains before it has customers on them, Rosenthal stressed. Running various networks without customers is wasting time and effort that can be put elsewhere. This is especially true for Myrmidon, which hosts everything in-house and does not rely on third parties like Amazon or Google Cloud. Additionally, they focused on setting up a second server on a different energy grid as another security layer, which can take over should anything happen to the first one. Therefore, there is plenty to do at all times. And with their dashboard launched and doing well, these are \u201cgreat times, exciting times, exciting markets,\u201d Rosenthal concluded. _________ About Nikolaj Rosenthal Nikolaj Rosenthal is the Co-Founder and CEO of Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider.

This Bitcoin is the result of a $6.2 Billion wealth management fraud conducted between 2014 and 2017, fronted by Chinese company Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology. In which, more than 128,000 people were defrauded. The UK government became aware of the situation after ex-restaurant worker Jian Wen attempted to launder funds by purchasing a $30 million property with Bitcoin. However, the transaction could not be completed since Wen was unable to explain the source of the funds. This prompted an investigation, which culminated in a raid on a property rented by \u201cfront person\u201d Wen and her boss Zhimin Qian, the suspected mastermind of the operation. During the raid, investigators seized 61,000 Bitcoins, worth $1.7 billion at the time. Under pressure to explain the damning situation, Wen initially claimed that Bitcoin was mined. She eventually changed her story, stating it was a \u201clove present\u201d from Qian, who fled the country after the raid. Jian Wen was ultimately put on trial for assisting Qian in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewellery, and property. While Wen denied all charges, Southwark Crown Court convicted her guilty of three counts of money laundering on March 20th. Bitcoin Seized: The Victims Want What is Rightfully Theirs Following the conviction, a group representing the scam victims set out to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money, now worth $4.3 billion. The group reportedly submitted a letter to China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to negotiate with the UK government for the return of the \u201chuge amount\u201d of seized Bitcoin. They also contacted China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, claiming to have the backing of almost 2,500 signatures from the victims, and want to submit them to both ministries. The letter requests that the Chinese government and the UK judicial departments work together to submit evidence proving their status as \u201clegitimate owners.\u201d The group said: \u201cWe do not want, and will never accept, a situation where Bitcoins are confiscated by the UK and not returned to us.\u201d At the time of writing, the UK government had not issued a statement on how it intends to deal with the Bitcoin it holds, and Qian is still at large. However, if the UK government evaluates that no one else was entitled to the asset, it would typically be divided and distributed to the police and Home Office. However, the victims who \u201csuffered extremely serious economic losses, resulting in family breakdown, separation from their children, indebtedness, and no money for medical treatment,\u201d have not gone without aid. Four victims who lost money in the scam claim that, since last May, victims who enrolled with Chinese police have received two pay-outs from a task group on the fraud, headed by Tianjin authorities. They stated that 8% and 5% of their investment capital had been returned with assets recovered from Lantian Gerui and its former employees. Additionally, a local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country\u2019s largest lender, has committed to assisting with the return process and has estimated that 207,000 people invested in the fraudulent scheme.

This figure is an improvement compared to the net loss of 90.6 billion won in 2022. Gopax\u2019s revenue grew 97% year over year amid recovering market sentiment. GOPAX Reports Net Loss of $37 Million in 2023, Faces Challenges with GoFi-Linked Debt Gopax cash flow statement Site: Streamy On April 12, GOPAX released a financial statement that comprises its balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The balance sheets comprise the related statements of profit or loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for the years that ended. GOPAX reported a net loss of 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) for the fiscal year 2023. As of the end of the reporting period, the company\u2019s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by KRW 66 billion, and total liabilities exceeded total assets by KRW 101 billion. Most of Gopax\u2019s net losses stemmed from GoFi-linked debt, from deposits stuck in Genesis Global Capital. Genesis, which operated Gopax\u2019s crypto custody service GoFi, suspended withdrawals in November 2022 due to a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement with FTX. According to the financial report, GoFi still owes users 63.7 billion won. Despite the continued net losses, Gopax exhibited favorable year-over-year performances in 2023. The exchange reported a significant increase in revenue, which surged by 97% to reach 3.1 billion won. Furthermore, the net operating loss decreased substantially, contracting 78% to approximately 17 billion won. The resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean cryptocurrency market propelled Gopax\u2019s enhanced financial results in 2023. Notably, South Korea remained one of the most active crypto markets globally, with the South Korean won overtaking the U.S. dollar as the primary fiat trading pair for cryptocurrencies in November 2023, according to Bloomberg. Binance Grapples with Regulatory Delays and Financial Strain in Gopax Acquisition Binance acquired Gopax at the end of 2022 to address the latter\u2019s liquidity challenges and expand Binance\u2019s presence in the South Korean market. However, financial authorities have been delaying the acceptance of Gopax\u2019s change of virtual asset business report for over a year, impeding Binance\u2019s plans for market entry. Binance\u2019s decision to acquire Gopax was driven by the latter\u2019s inability to return funds to users following the FTX incident involving its virtual asset deposit service, \u2018GoFi.\u2019 Gopax Shareholders Source: Streamy Binance became the majority shareholder and took on the responsibility for GoFi\u2019s debt, appointing Leon Singh Pung, the former head of Binance Asia Pacific, as CEO of Gopax. Despite submitting a report on the change in virtual asset business to the FIU, the decision regarding its acceptance has been consistently postponed. Gopax later replaced its CEO with former CEO Lee Jung-hoon and submitted another change report, but the FIU continued to delay its decision. In response to these challenges, Binance has initiated discussions to reduce its shares in Gopax to become the second-largest shareholder. This strategic move will alleviate Gopax\u2019s financial burdens and regulatory compliance pressures. Binance CEO Richard Teng even traveled to Seoul in March to engage with local financial regulators to address these concerns. As of the latest financial report, Binance remains the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake. However, a Binance spokesperson has stated that there are no updates regarding any changes to Binance\u2019s ownership stake in Gopax.

While FLOKI is up by 2.5% in a week, it has now declined by 30% in a week, although the popular meme coin has posted a 460% increase in the last 12 months. This is very impressive performance, and with FLOKI remaining popular among retail investors and whales, it could easily see a recovery in the coming weeks. This is particularly the case when the market is waiting on a possible surge, which could coincide with the next Bitcoin halving on April 20. Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 4% Overnight \u2013 What\u2019s Going On? One encouraging feature of FLOKI\u2019s chart is that it has bounced a little in the past hour, after dropping earlier this morning. This could mean that it has bottomed out as far as its recent decline is concerned, a claim which receives some tentative reinforcement from its support line (green). Source: TradingView It\u2019s also notable that FLOKI\u2019s 30-day average (orange) has reached what looks like a bottom in relation to the 200-day (blue), implying that the coin has entered an oversold position and is ready to rebound. Having said that, FLOKI\u2019s trading volume remains largely lowkey at $150 million, whereas it rose as high as $2 billion in early March. What we can take from this is that whales have yet to return to the meme token, despite having pumped it vigorously in the weeks preceding its last big surge. $FLOKI: It seems that price is still in a wave-iv correction. Ideal target for wave-C is the 100% Fib extension level at $0.000137. A break above $0.000266 would be the first sign that wave-iv already has bottomed. pic.twitter.com/RSt5KjF9bi \u2014 Man of Bitcoin (@Manofbitcoin) April 12, 2024 Yet given that the coin has been down for several weeks now, it may be a good time to buy it, given that it\u2019s selling at a relative discount. Indeed, the next week or so may see the crypto market rally as a whole, helped by the incoming Bitcon halving, which is due in eight days. And the Floki price could ride any resulting bull market, with the token continuing to attract new exchange listings that could support it in the long run. More importantly, it also has a detailed and ambitious roadmap that should help improve its utility and fundamentals. FLOKI ROADMAP: WHAT\u2019S NEXT ON OUR AGENDA\u2026 From the get-go, we\u2019ve been VERY clear about our goal for Floki: To be the most known and most used cryptocurrency in the world. Our new roadmap outlines how we intend to achieve this:https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH pic.twitter.com/hBydq4D4lX \u2014 FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) March 22, 2024 For this reason, the Floki price should reach $0.00025 in the next couple of months, before reaching $0.00035 in the latter half of the year. Newer Meme Tokens May Bring Bigger Returns While FLOKI remains one of the most popular meme coins in the market, it isn\u2019t the only promising token available right now. Numerous newer meme coins have emerged in the past few weeks, with several holding presales that not only help support their development, but also help them attract supporters prior to listing. One coin doing this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme token that has raised more than $2.8 million in its increasingly popular sale. Embracing Inclusive Accessibility! $DOGEVERSE opens its doors to a wide audience, from #Ethereum aficionados to those preferring the rapid, cost-effective benefits of #Solana or #Polygon, fostering a diverse and inclusive community. pic.twitter.com/sXPOvaoz67 \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 12, 2024 What\u2019s so exciting about Dogeverse is that it\u2019s one of the only meme tokens in the market to make itself multi-chain. It will launch on Ethereum, before bridging to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base. What this means is that it will find applications and uses in multiple ecosystems and platforms, something which could raise its demand in relation to other similar tokens. It also comes with bullish tokenomics, with its capped supply of 200 million tokens ultimately making it a deflationary token. And unlike the original Dogecoin, holders will be able to stake DOGEVERSE, earning themselves a passive income in addition to any price gains. #DOGEVERSE bringing in optimized costs and speed! Users enjoy the ability to choose chains with lower transaction fees and faster processing times, significantly enhancing the trading and transaction experience. pic.twitter.com/phcMnBhwLT \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 11, 2024 All in all, the use of multiple chains will make DOGEVERSE one of the fastest and most useful tokens in the crypto ecosystem. Investors can join its presale by heading over to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000293. The presale has an allocation of 15% of the coin\u2019s overall supply, with 10% going to staking and 50% going to marketing and project funds (a further 15% goes to liquidity and another 10% to its ecosystem). Given how quickly the sale is raising money, it may sell out fairly soon, so interested parties are advised to act quickly.

For UNI holders, this peaked when their token hit $16 and it has been in steady decline since, with the steepest losses posted in the last 48 hours. According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, a sell-off, which gained momentum on the eighth peaked yesterday when the RSI bottomed down to about 20.

Uniswap? DEXs? DeFi? Learn and earn with 99Bitcoins! Uniswap is DeFi\u2019s largest decentralized exchange (DEX). This means users can buy and sell a large inventory of cryptocurrencies as with centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but they have to self-custody their crypto. Some see this as a barrier to entry. While it\u2019s not difficult to select a wallet and begin trading crypto on DEXs, it\u2019s not as streamlined as whipping out a MasterCard, paying for it, and letting the exchange do the custodial work. Many lost faith in letting exchanges custody their crypto after the recession in 2021/2022, when crypto companies with liquidity troubles routinely paused withdrawals to head off bank runs. It culminated with the collapse of FTX, an exchange that had been sending billions of customer funds to its sister company, Alameda Research. Since these revelations, there has been growing attraction around DeFi and self-custodying crypto through decentralized wallets that give them control over their own private keys, like Uniswap\u2019s. If anything, the events of 2021 were a reminder to the industry on the importance of educating the public. The most important lesson people learned after FTX was the importance decentralization: the founding ethos of crypto. However, it can be overwhelming to crypto novices to know where to educate themselves. Luckily, there is a new crypto presale for an established crypto education project that hopes to revolutionize learning with its learn-to-earn model. 99Bitcoins is a heritage platform that brings with it a long-established community of 700,000 YouTube subscribers alongside 2 million registered users for its crypto courses. Through its revolutionary Learn-to-Earn model, 99Bitcoins uses a blend of gamification and a leaderboard reward system to make users feel like their learning is bearing tangible (spendable) benefits. In other words: users earn crypto for learning about crypto. Interested? Visit the secure presale website today to Buy 99Bitcoins. The article Is Uniswap Going to Zero?

According to the economists surveyed by Reuters, they\u2019re predicting that the UK\u2019s annual inflation is going to chill a bit to 3.1% in March, down from February\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been since the middle of 2021. But let\u2019s not throw a party yet, guys, because even with this drop, inflation\u2019s still sitting higher than the Bank of England\u2019s comfort zone at 2%. Keeping an Eye on the Core Not just the regular numbers, but the core inflation, which basically ignores the up and down drama of food and energy prices, is also expected to take a small step back to 4.3% from last month\u2019s 4.5%. What this means is the Bank of England might not get too happy with slashing rates too much this year. Just last week, those who bet on these things pushed their expectations of a rate cut from June to August. Why? Because the U.S. dropped a surprise with stronger-than-anticipated inflation for the third time in a row. Tuesday\u2019s also a big day with labour market stats hitting the stands. Everyone\u2019s watching this because it\u2019s got a lot to say about wage growth. Hot wages have been keeping the service sector inflation a bit too lively at 6.1% in February. Good news might be on the horizon, though, as experts think earnings growth might cool off a touch to 5.5% in the three months to February, a slight dip from 5.6% in the previous period. This could give policymakers a bit of breathing room. Is the UK Economy Doing a Slow Dance? Let\u2019s talk GDP. The UK\u2019s GDP nudged up by just 0.1% in February, says the Office for National Statistics. It\u2019s a tiny bump, but it\u2019s in line with what folks were expecting. This number comes after a bit of a slump in the last half of 2023, where the economy shrank, slipping the UK into a technical recession. But there was a small win in January with a growth revision up to 0.3%. Not everything\u2019s looking up though\u2014construction output wasn\u2019t doing too hot, dropping 1.9% in February. On the flip side, production output was the star of the show, climbing 1.1% in the same month, but growth in the big-shot services sector barely moved from 0.3% to 0.1%. Some economists are not all that optimistic about a strong bounce back. They think it might not be enough to keep inflation and interest rates from tumbling down like what\u2019s happening over in the U.S. In fact, British inflation took a bigger dive than folks expected in March, hitting a near 2¬Ω-year low of 3.4%. But over in the U.S., prices climbed higher than expected at 3.5% this week, making some rethink when those interest rate cuts might start\u2014pushing guesses from summer to September. And this has got some wondering if what\u2019s happening with the Federal Reserve will make other central banks, including the Bank of England, pump the brakes on any early rate cuts, especially if the U.S. dollar starts flexing. Goldman Sachs even tweaked their forecast last Friday, dropping their prediction of Bank of England rate cuts from five down to four for the year, seeing them starting in June and then maybe easing into a quarterly rhythm. Simon French, the chief economist at Panmure Gordon, chatted on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Europe,\u201d pointing out that the Bank of England likes its independence but can\u2019t ignore the upcoming UK national election hinted for later this year. The heat\u2019s on, especially with some talk from the governing party expecting rate cuts soon. He said this could push the Bank to get those rate cuts out of the way before voters hit the polls. French wrapped it up by noting the numbers show the recession might be done, but it\u2019s not exactly time to throw a party. The UK\u2019s growth is still limping behind its pre-pandemic pace and lagging the U.S., but it\u2019s keeping up with much of Europe and showing some spunk in areas like manufacturing and car production.","article_summary":"UK investors are tuning in this Wednesday to grab the latest on inflation data, which will paint a picture of where interest rates might head this year.

The BRICS, which has been on a roll adding new countries since the start of 2024, might just swing its doors wide open for Serbia. There\u2019s a growing trend among nations to ditch the U.S. dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency, and BRICS is smack in the middle of it, handing out invites to those who are down with this plan. So, is Serbia about to become the first Balkan star in the BRICS sky? Well, the word out is that BRICS rolled out the red carpet for Serbia to join them at their next summit in Russia later this year. This is huge because Serbia has been hanging around, waiting to get into the European Union since 2009, without much luck. Looks like they might just pivot to a different crew. Last year, Serbia\u2019s Movement of Socialists got parliament to give the thumbs up to apply for BRICS membership. They were like, \u201cMost of our folks think joining BRICS is the best move.\u201d If Serbia shows up at the summit and gets in, they\u2019ll be the first European country to crack into this group. Whoop, whoop! Let\u2019s Talk Numbers This just in from the World Bank on Thursday. They\u2019re bumping up Serbia\u2019s economic growth forecast for 2024 to 3.5% from the earlier 3.0%. And it doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014things are expected to speed up to 3.8% in 2025 and hit 4.0% in 2026. But here\u2019s the kicker: the Serbian economy\u2019s got to pull off some serious structural moves to keep this party going, especially with the EU income levels in sight. And it\u2019s not just about growth. The World Bank\u2019s betting on a 5% inflation rate for Serbia this year, but they think it\u2019ll chill out to 3.5% by 2025 and 3.2% the year after. As for the current account gap, that\u2019s gonna widen to 3.6% of GDP this year from last year\u2019s 2.6%, and don\u2019t expect it to shrink anytime soon. On the flip side, Serbia\u2019s fiscal deficit is set to shrink from 2.2% of GDP last year to 2.0% in 2024, and then down to 1.5% for the next couple of years. BRICS Going Big BRICS isn\u2019t just Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa anymore, you know. They\u2019ve welcomed Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE into the fold. Now since its start in 2009, BRICS has been sort of China-heavy on the trade front, with everyone else just tagging along. But lately, India\u2019s started to catch up, thanks to its booming economy. But here\u2019s the tea. Even though they\u2019re tight, the rest of the BRICS gang doesn\u2019t really trade much with each other compared to how much business they do with China. Interesting, huh? And with China pushing hard on the foreign policy gas pedal, they\u2019ve been the big boss at the United Nations too, except for that one time Brazil didn\u2019t toe the line on Ukraine in 2022. Okay so, China wants to expand BRICS even more to include a mix of countries that are either loaded with cash or seriously strapped for it, plus some major oil players like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The big question is what BRICS can really pull off with such a mixed bag of countries and whether they can keep their goals straight post-expansion. They\u2019re also hollering for some major changes at big institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, wanting a setup that really speaks for everyone, not just the big guns. Plus, they\u2019re all about using local currencies for trade, especially with China, to keep things clear and fair in global trade. How this BRICS expansion turns out depends a lot on how they handle their internal stuff and what the rest of the world thinks about it. Whether the boys can keep up the momentum depends on a lot of things, like how China\u2019s power plays out and how the rest of the BRICS members feel about it. With the diversity in the group, it could either be a huge win for everyone or a tricky path to tread, especially for India, feeling the heat from China. So, that\u2019s the lowdown. Will my girl Serbia end up with a new set of powerful pals? I sure hope so!

In the same manner, after a fallover of more than 10% that started from $3,525, Ethereum was trading at $3,161.

Cryptocurrency liquidation totaled approximately $735 million overnight in a sign that this downturn has affected everybody regardless of what they trade in. Venues and the expected BTC halving.

It is a huge implication for Ethereum as a project in development. EigenDA does not limit itself to the role of a validator service. It is a new mechanism that has improved the operation of the Ethereum validation systems as a whole. Announcing: EigenLayer ‚ôæ EigenDA Mainnet Launch pic.twitter.com/bTp5BfnsKE \u2014 EigenLayer (@eigenlayer) April 9, 2024 The impact of EigenDA At the end of the line, EigenDA has already prompted over 4.1 million ETH staked on EigenLayer which is the community\u2019s indictment of trust and the likelihood of the value of the offered service. To an extent that will astound you, 70% of the newly recognized Ethereum validators have chosen to restake at EigenLayer by giving their assets to the AVS. Being capable of staking is taking advantage of interacting with other protocols with one\u2019s staking position on Ethereum intact. Such adaptability is of extreme value for backing the main Ethereum chain as well as smaller blockchains running on it that need the highly reliable security layer of Ethereum. Thus, EigenDA works as a middle layer, attaching itself to Ethereum miners, their tokens, and stakes to back up the next-gen blockchains as they emerge. In doing so, trust and security are increased, and different blockchains are interconnected in a resilient network. This ensures network stability and continuity across the board. This practice additionally covers core elements such as neutrality and decentralization in order to allow anyone to become a staking provider. Technological advances and needs of the near future As well as essential validation services, EigenDA is intended for providing extended scalability, as well as cost-efficiency and ease of integration for various rollup and blockchain applications, and operators. The Relayers or the Rollups, as they are widely popular, are now able to attach to the main EigenDA net effortlessly, thereby increasing the transactions\u2019 potential. A year down the line, this integration will have stabilized, giving way to a more robust cycle of operators and delegators to provide added-value solutions of data storage on Ethereum. EigenDA and likewise AVS would be developed not only for technical improvement reasons but also to reconfirm Ethereum as a trustworthy and multi-purpose blockchain system. Ethereum\u2019s staking functionality, deploying approximately a quarter of the entire network circulating supply (32.2 million ETH) in the staking pool, is making a way for EigenDA to wield key influence on the network in a time to come. At the moment, the total value of staked ETH stands higher than $112 billion \u2013 the coin that supports more than one million validators, such fact makes the Ethereum blockchain probably one of the most secure in the whole cryptocurrency industry. With the advent of crypto and blockchain landscapes turning out to be dynamic, the involvement of creative solutions such as EigenDA will be highly relevant in shaping the destiny of decentralized networks. Lido is today the undisputed Ethereum liquid staking leader with its inventory worth $33.2 billion, or 29% of the total staked amount \u2013 such is a vibrant and competitive landscape that EigenLayer will be entering. That is not only infrastructure improvement but also stimulates the validator services development within the blockchain industry.","article_summary":"The first EigenLayer initiative implemented on one of the biggest keys in the cryptocurrency world is called Available Validator Service (AVS) and is known as EigenDA.

The removal of the stocking limit time constraints is forecasted to facilitate a more self-sustaining system and more dynamism in staking. Therefore, larger number of participants within the system will be generated and this will result in more chances for them. Enhancing stability and growth The scheme of EigenLayer\u2019s evolution is composed to drive stability and build up the platform ecosystem around Ethereum. Thus, the initial period is reflected through stages 1, 2, and 3, which are the vital days of the system that involved the positive development of restakers, operators, AVSs (Actively Validated Services), and rollups. Contrastively, the previous LST cap, which meant less room for the network to grow, is now the promoter of the activation of the network and also, because the protocol awards try to balance the neutrality and the decentralization at the network, by suggesting a 33% cap for users. The methodology thus conceived by EigenLayer will effectively mean that the same ETH staked now can be repurposed or used to safeguard other parts of the ecosystem as well. The idea of cryptography security another setting emerges in Ethereum main chain. The protocol has already received 3,880,000 ETH (equivalent to $12,670,000,000 of market value) to be staked by restakers meaning that the number of these stakers is only growing as the protocol becomes more relevant to them. The employment of main players such as Coinbase Staking as operators highlight the oncoming restaking industry faith, however, supervisory activities must also be on top of it, since its rapid growth gives way to financial and security risks. The fundraising program of EigenLayer does not only serve as the reinforcement of Ethereum network but it also initiates simpler infrastructure for the development of decentralized and permissionless apps based on Ethereum network. This definitely may have strong influence within the entire DeFi domain, and can as a result result in advancement of more precise security solutions.","article_summary":"The implementation of a good update on the Decentralized Exchange (DeFi) of Ethereum Blockchain was introduced by the community governance of EigenLayer, the initiative started by Eigen Lab.

The World Food Program estimates that nearly 55 million people in the region will soon face difficulties feeding themselves, marking a 12% increase over last year and 4 million more than earlier forecasts. This crisis is propelled by rampant inflation and significant currency devaluations. Trade sanctions on military regimes are also making things worse, aggravating the food shortage, as stated in a recent announcement by a United Nations agency. Ollo Sib, a senior researcher at WFP, pointed out, \u201cThe economic situation is now a major force driving the food crisis, especially in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, where inflation hits hardest.\u201d Rising Costs and Economic Policies Staple grain prices have soared to ten times their five-year average due to the plummeting value of local currencies and escalated fuel and transport costs. This year, the region faces a daunting 12 million ton deficit in cereal production. Pandemic-era restrictions on food exports have also hampered trade, reducing food availability. Sib elaborated, \u201cThe spike in food and transportation costs is creating a long-term impact, as all these countries depend on imported food.\u201d Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, reports over 26 million people struggling with food security, up from 25 million last year. Eastern Chad, usually sufficient in food, now reports record food insecurity levels due to the influx of refugees escaping the civil war in Sudan. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on Nigeria to urgently address its escalating food insecurity, with nearly 10% of its population affected. The country\u2019s ongoing economic reforms, such as eliminating fuel subsidies and loosening currency controls\u2014though popular with investors\u2014have accelerated inflation to the highest rate in nearly 30 years. Economic Performance and Projections The IMF stresses, \u201cAddressing rising food insecurity is now a critical policy priority.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s recent move to implement a cash transfer system for vulnerable households is a significant step, though its success depends on effective implementation. Amid a food price inflation rate of 35.4%, Nigeria has seen protests and looting in various parts, including Abuja. Over 40% of its population lives in extreme poverty. To combat inflation and stabilize the currency, Nigeria\u2019s central bank has increased interest rates to a record 22.75%. The naira has lost about 70% of its value against the dollar since mid-2023. More hikes in borrowing costs are expected. The World Bank has flagged that sluggish growth in Nigeria could dampen the entire sub-region\u2019s economic outlook. The lender\u2019s report predicts an increase in economic activity in Western and Central Africa, from 3.2% in 2023 to 3.7% in 2024, and further to 4.2% by 2025\u20132026. However, growth is hindered by Nigeria\u2019s lower-than-average performance. Excluding Nigeria, the sub-region could grow by 4.4% in 2024 and 5% in 2025\u20132026. Meanwhile, the West African Economic and Monetary Union is expected to see growth rates of 5.9% in 2024 and 6.2% in 2025, bolstered by strong economic activities in Benin, C√¥te d\u2019Ivoire, Niger, and Senegal. The World Bank notes that Nigeria\u2019s growth is anticipated at 3.3% in 2024 and 3.6% in the following years, as reforms slowly take effect. It also expects a stabilization in the oil sector with a recovery in production and slightly lower prices, leading to a more stable macroeconomic environment and sustained growth in the non-oil economy.","article_summary":"West Africa is currently enduring a severe economic crunch, with a sharp rise in hunger among its populace.

Thus, the intertwining of AI and behavioral science infers that the future will depend on our will, meaning what we want out of life largely depends on all of us. Some things were presented in a movie adapted from the book Consilience, chapter \u201cConsilience,\u201d where Edward O. Wilson brilliantly demonstrated the disciplines that sometimes are basically in the conflict in the book. This was the way of \u201cjoining disciplines\u201d into a single scientific explanation of human existence, and the social complexities of evolution were shown. Nevertheless, it is just a step towards smart dawn that raises many questions, the foremost of which is which roads are most likely to be followed. The other thing is that new marketing channels will cause automation promotion and behavioral decision-making. Also, the legality issue should not be overlooked because such an invention will surely make the world look quite different. Unlocking insights: Behavioral data analysis Despite this fact, it is necessary to analyze the potential of AI in its capability of filling the huge void of behavioral data that cannot be disclosed as the very first and the very primary prerequisite that gives AI the ability to obtain amazingly accurate details of human life that the human eye just can not see. Regarding the novelty characteristics of AI, after the appearance of AI artifacts, the development of AI beings commences. If I were to name the AI artifacts that are AI\u2019s offspring, I would call them AI child offspring. Another significant power for organizations is enriching the employees with knowledge and advanced things and selecting the topmost services. In computer science, using examples, they will be process-oriented and learned. They will also be grounded on rules and may be used for student studies or data processing. Employing sensory science provides the means to influence the audience via sensory strategies that involve much of the central system or directly invoke psychological motivators, social units, and social facilitators. The general outcome of these efforts is to hold each trait of AI, ranging from artificial neural networks to machine vision or natural language processors, which improves the AI\u2019s analytical powers. This can give customers highly sophisticated information that contrasts with operations and strategies presented in their businesses, boosting innovation and company growth. People of this type were turning to progressively greater assimilation, resulting in the abundant wasting of their time and effort to only some small parts. It is also not to forget that the aim of today\u2019s psychological content is devoid of the element of humanness. Psychology may be like a preventive mental health action with a mission to protect people\u2019s welfare and the environment from harmful substances. Health instruction is an example of a system that, rather than allowing people to go on any sabotage, saves them in healthy ways to improve their mental health and apply customization and personalization, which are beneficial. In other words, despite a considerable gap (a result of the different number of years), we can recognize many similarities between the mankind of the past and us. Mobile skills, combined with human mindset knowledge, make more complicated activities for psychologists \u2013 such as robot developers engaged in interventions and change corrections \u2013 and those organizations hire most often to introduce changes that will improve workplace satisfaction. This is also true because such changes will make the employees much more satisfied and depressed to a lesser extent. While these people whose lives are not just giving a pace as well as the progress of the universe, unending progress, and at the same time those people who are left abruptly are alone, it is a large number for that society. The two cases of society depicting the consequences of the revolt are the collapse of the societal arrangements and the order in the society being restored. Ethical integration: Ensuring human-centric AI Therefore, socially, the parts of the technology could be paired up in progress. Besides, modern bioethics will have to tackle moral issues that are more holistic than they used to. Therefore, the ethical engine somewhat inserts ethics when the ethics that AI has to adhere to by default are included in the condition of the machine\u2019s operation. For society, a well-defined societal order and law would be the priority so that the immigration of people with different lifestyles and ways of living into the new environment could be smooth and easy. Finally, science deals with psychology, the domain we humans already know from the core. Furthermore, the other main constituents of such ethical science are the establishment of philosophy, the cognitive moral processes, and the social moral norms, which are undoubtedly of great value/significance. Briefly, AI applications can even solve specific business ethics; so to speak, they can solve even ethical problems at an atomic scale. Similarly, presenting ethics\u2019 value and role while dealing with behavioral science during development will be a stepping stone toward more opportunities. Last but not least is the issue of bias in algorithmic decision-making, which can, however, be successfully resolved with the following: Values-based AI, on the other hand, through the utilization of their lives to enhance the efforts aimed at diagnosis and finding solutions for more civility in the world, would always expect that peace had been well-maintained. Artificial intelligence and behavioral science raise the speculative question: will we need people to use such devices with computers only managing the process helped with the data? AI and BD-oriented smart systems would be helpful for the administration in their quick assessment and in understanding the similar feelings of people undergoing different moods, especially the situations that would be politically transparent as to how they influence family life and society in general. The sign on the door can say \u2018Man-machine relationship\u2019 or \u2018Man and machine.\u2019 However, this journey is also very interesting and sometimes challenging because many people have recently tried to figure out this connection between humans and machines. Our pondering about that can eventually grow to the scale of the universe, which is non-linear and full of chaos and freedom. This may even result in a kind of foresight on the part of the companies that launch their naturalistic creations as a means of acquiring something deeper. This development comes with an economy of machines that excel in automation, and additionally, their manner of processing and production has become the season-controlling idea. Humans pull forward and rebuild their lives after the tragedy through this approach.

Where A.I. election aid tasks such as unexpressed expressions that a person is depressed or suicidal, and these expressions are the core reasons the elections came to light were the main priorities. It is vital to reach out to more people, educating them about voting day and discussing the election system and results because we do this through straightforward inquiries. Efficient information retrieval Assume that Election Mitra is the research body for the documentary. AI allows us to hack data systems and filter data by authorizing us to review the source database we managed to collect. Now, the actual method of this process is that it renders this data functionally unintelligible for anyone attempting to decrypt it. The pamphlets depict printed material of RULs with textbooks and images, which have proven to be an insightful glimpse into the trends in this fashion world market. We propose employing AI systems like self-governing and fact-checking services to ensure that Election Mitra provides proper and relevant solutions to the voters quickly, specifically during the election season. Electors won\u2019t read such debates that are election-oriented when they can sooner reach articles in an easy form, and that accentuates. The array of problems that of the purpose of \u201cElection Mitra\u201d is not limited to local bodies; however, it also provides its members with the acts drafted by governmental bodies and the speeches of different civil organizations for the construction of a fair society by skill the gap between electorate and politician this will be done through the adoption of different clauses. He will put it that way: the Atrocity Acts for SC/ST, people\u2019s Representation, and Excise Acts will be among the few debated in this session. As training progresses through layers of simple to complex, the learner is provided with a guided model police agency even where issues span different fields and sciences, including problem areas like data disruptions and disciplines, among other fields. Mitra, the impartial universal housing location that deals with many other issues related to the last elections, will surely be your new cool place that will push your information to those you don\u2019t know. User-friendly interface On the other hand, personalized software is developed to provide the voters with a simple and easy operation, which is fulfilled by the offering of an interface that gives a chance to people with different knowledge levels to have a role in the whole thing by way of creating the interface being friendly to the users which is understandable and easy to use will be done by creating the platform of interaction which is friendly to the people with access to various skills Thus, the function of navigating will be supported mainly by screens in devices rather than burdening the user\u2019s mind when she is using desktop and her pocket device. Visuals that do not have a tone that is too \u2018corporate-like\u2019 and are a \u2018simple\u2019 platform meet this one criterion: the learning process should be effortless. With a Live active learning model being discussed, the few crucial parts, such as the sentiment analysis piece of the application, are having the intelligent reply with the sentence that making the application does not have to deal with boring content for the users. The period called Election Mitra is solely focused on making a section of the future process that will eventually be accessible to many people so that they have just mobile phones to know the necessary election data. Like bookshops, these online facilities help restrict the reach of reading material to different book genres for some people and just position their readers\u2019 large appetites with the different makes available. Thus, the connection between peace deputies and individuals grows, thus humanizing the police, electoral bodies, and political parties. With this technology, the people can now understand the elections\u2019 rules and, simultaneously, give the officials a chance to conduct the elections on time. In Weinstock, Weiber, and Vindel \u2018s words, electoral management is an instrument of transformation of democracy. Consequently, it cannot take place due to the operational objectives of a polity as it is citizens-oriented, transparent, or accountable. Future prospects A major part of what charges the mobile app called the Election Mitra is the awesome public openness towards using the app. Also, the more the app picks up and gets a gripping following, the more it boasts the app development company to add more features to the liking of political parties. On the other hand, the midterm electoral report will include newswire reports and presentations about the election process, election procedures, and the admission of polling booth locations. Furthermore, e-modules will be woven into the talk to improve the understanding process, and the concept idea will be presented apart from the accountability. On top of this, incorporating the element of the \u201chuman\u201d facet to the \u201cwill of the Election Mitra\u201d is tasked with humanizing it. Therefore, the allegiance of Kadapa voters to its essence and processes will be cultivated. Being a media for the entire electoral conduct of Kadapa, the radio is thus expected to aid in various aspects of the future electoral conduct. At the same time, it may be applied in such a way as to overshadow most of the known conduct of elections. Subsequently, the model of a new Police station serving the district of Kadapa has been built on the principle of new concept innovation, the process of which will be vaulted and supported by the policy-makers who are willing to step another stage forward in the bottled ballot, meaning that an election will be opened in Maavra, another place in which the whole process will start. The wide range of issues presented as arguments may be varied in information; still, there is a spreading of views during this point that needs to be considered. This element is the key factor that generates a source of sustaining and encouraging all the stakeholders, empowering and activating them to make it possible and maintain democracy. The infrastructure will be user-oriented and unified \u2013 so the users can grasp the idea of compactly campaigning as a whole. This kind of innovation provides us with a space arch, which is the goal of society, and current politics are factors that will affect the further advancement of the platform. Upshot: The tactic I consider is the end-user\u2019s convenience, and you should ensure the interface is used comfortably and conveniently. Whatever the plan, be it a solvable problem, it will never remain with holes or loopholes. Whatever the loopholes are, all the good ideas, if not all, will be used to develop a plan for implementing good strategies and removing the problems from the community.

Click here to download a PDF of this 7,000 word essay on the origins of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1] The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology. Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T\u2019s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks. The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity. But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation\u2014 it\u2019s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph. This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed\u2014and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future. Outline I. Decentralized systems are markets II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods III. How can decentralized systems price computations? IV. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin V. Conclusion A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai\u2019s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts \u201cfrom exactly that point.\u201d In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin.

Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented: Digital currencies should be P2P networks Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation Money is created through an auction Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins Transactions are batched into blocks Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work All blocks are stored by all participants Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn\u2019t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi\u2019s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list. Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place? This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi\u2019s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money. I. Decentralized systems are markets Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words \u201cdecentralized\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces. For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the topology of their network diagrams, but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets. Distributed systems rely upon central authorities In this work, we take \u201cdistributed\u201d to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as \u201cnodes\u201d) which must communicate, typically over a network. Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems. But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system. Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes. The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system. Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required. In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system. Decentralized systems have no central authorities We take \u201cdecentralized\u201d to have a stronger meaning than \u201cdistributed\u201d: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for \u201cdecentralized\u201d is \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d (P2P). Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems: Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry\u2014anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority. Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage. Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert. These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin: \"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of\u2026 centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" - Nakamoto, 2008 But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority. Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi\u2019s nod to Gnutella, anyone who\u2019s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online. Satoshi didn\u2019t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam. Decentralized systems are governed through incentives The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating. Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they\u2019re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly. The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market\u2019s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system. II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility. Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges. Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true\u2014traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane. This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems. Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems. Computation is the first decentralized good The first example of a \u201cdecentralized good\u201d is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3] Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources\u2014they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce. The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital \u201cproof\u201d that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given \u201cdifficulty\u201d which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority. The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called \u201cproof-of-work\u201d.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo\u2019s phrase, \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource: \"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource.\" - Dwoak & Naor, 1993 In Dwork & Naor\u2019s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email. Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a \u201cpricing function\u201d because, by adjusting the difficulty, a \u201cpricing authority\u201d could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a \u201cprice\u201d for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam. Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature \u201cpricing function\u201d and \u201cpricing authority\u201d supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource\u2019s controller. In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations. Currency is the second decentralized good But computations aren\u2019t a good currency. The proofs used to \u201ctrade\u201d computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can\u2019t be reused for a different input. Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider. This constraint is useful \u2013 it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender\u2019s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can\u2019t be respent for sending a different email. But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren\u2019t fungible, they can\u2019t be re-spent,[5] and they don\u2019t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash. Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems: \"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use.\" - Adam Back, 1997 We don\u2019t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market. Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere \u201caccess control mechanism\u201d. Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers\u2026in the units of the currency that\u2019s being created! Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives. Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure. The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints. Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it: Computations through proof-of-work Units of the currency we\u2019re trying to build The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy\u2014the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself! The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo\u2019s bit gold and Wei Dai\u2019s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded. III. How can decentralized systems price computations? A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency. We don\u2019t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called \u201cprogress\u201d. Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn\u2019t be progress\u2014it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value. When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable \u201cprices\u201d and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function. But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty\u2014 as measured by the number of corresponding computations\u2014may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price? Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold: \"The main problem\u2026is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract \"compute cycle.\" \u2026Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold.\" - Szabo, 2005 A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations. Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the \u201ccost of computing\u201d. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money: 'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.\" - Dai, 1998 Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a \u201cstandard basket\u201d, which computer solves a given problem \u201cmost economically\u201d, or the cost of computation on the \u201copen market\u201d. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems! To be fair to Dai, he realized this: \"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol.\" - Dai, 1998 Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let\u2019s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo\u2019s insights into the problem. Use external markets Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be \u201csecurely timestamped\u201d: \"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on.\" - Szabo, 2005 Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases \u201csecurely\u201d and \u201cdistributed fashion\u201d are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) \u201coutside the system\u201d services for timestamping.[6] The time a unit of digital currency was created is important because it links the computations performed to real-world production cost. Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right\u2014the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation: \"\u2026However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 \"Inferring\u201d the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible: \"\u2026Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency: \"\u2026[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.\" - Szabo, 2005 To paraphrase Szabo, \u201cto assay the value of\u2026 bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp\u201d. The dealers defining \u201clarger units of approximately equal value\u201d are providing a similar pricing function as Dai\u2019s \u201cstandard basket of commodities\u201d. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger \u201cunits of approximately equal value\u201d by dealers in markets outside the network. To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw: \"\u2026The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address.\" - Szabo, 2005 Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money. Use internal markets Szabo\u2019s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it? Let\u2019s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi\u2019s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney\u2019s auction model[7]: \"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]\u2026 instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures. Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on. Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation. Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly.\" Dai, 1998 B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo\u2019s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other. But implementing Dai\u2019s proposal as written would be challenging: In the \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the \u201coptimal increase in the money supply for the next period\u201d. How \u201coptimal\u201d should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described. Regardless of what was planned, the \u201cBidding\u201d phase allows anyone to submit a \u201cbid\u201d to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money. Once bids are submitted, the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it\u2019s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted \u2013 when does the \u201cBidding\u201d phase end and the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase begin? These problems recur in the \u201cMoney ]reation\u201d phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of \u201chighest bids\u201d? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency? Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented. The root of this complexity is Dai\u2019s belief that the \u201coptimal\u201d rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create units of b-money by broadcasting a bid and then doing the corresponding proof-of-work. Both Szabo and Dai proposed using a market exchanging digital currency for computations yet neither bit gold nor b-money defined a monetary policy to regulate the supply of currency within this market.

Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi\u2019s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote: \"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\" - Satoshi, 2009 Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks\u2014with a concern about monetary policy. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The \u201coptimal\u201d rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi \u201cdiscovered\u201d bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. \u2014and not someone else. It\u2019s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply. A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It\u2019s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai\u2019s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let\u2019s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint. All 21M bitcoin already exist In b-money, each \u201cmoney creation period\u201d included a \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, in which users were expected to share their \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project. Satoshi was able to replace the recurring \u201cPlanning\u201d phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. This changes the semantics of bitcoin\u2019s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it\u2019s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that \u201cbitcoin miners create bitcoin\u201d. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they\u2019re buying it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t valuable because \u201cbitcoin are made from energy\u201d\u2014bitcoin\u2019s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. Let\u2019s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn\u2019t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus. Satoshi\u2019s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing \u201cPlanning\u201d phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin. Bitcoin is priced through consensus This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the \u201cBidding\u201d phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation \u201cbids\u201d from many different users. Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn\u2019t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi\u2019s predetermined schedule. The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8] The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi\u2019s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block: The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section): Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price. Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus \u201cblockchain\u201d containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain. Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy \u2013 just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented. This added complexity was removed by Satoshi\u2019s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Time closes all spreads In the \u201cComputation\u201d phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they\u2019d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller \u2013 but who is the buyer? In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner\u2019s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to \u201cexecute a trade\u201d but to pay the current asking price in computations. The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid\u2014the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network\u2019s current asking price. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008 Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin\u2019s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let\u2019s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn\u2019t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn\u2019t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. But Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo\u2019s \u201csecure timestamping protocol.\u201d Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a \u201cdistributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,\u201d and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world \u201ctimechain\u201d rather than \u201cblockchain\u201d to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work market.[10] Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations. Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time. A standing order creates consensus The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the \u201cMoney creation\u201d phase of b-money. User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the \u201chighest bids\u2026in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created\u201d in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the \u201cByzantine generals\u201d or sometimes the \u201cdouble-spend\u201d problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem \u2013 socalled \u201cByzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms\u201d\u2014require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network\u2019s current asking price\u2014 nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner\u2019s resources. Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin\u2019s market has no phases\u2014it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network. This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] We established in previous sections that bitcoin\u2019s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! Moreover, this new \u201cNakamoto consensus\u201d only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing. IV. Conclusion B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi\u2019s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin\u2019s implementation. There is a lot more to bitcoin\u2019s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the \u201cprimary\u201d market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.

In particular, Ryan Gentry, Will Cole and Stephen Hall met with me weekly to debate these ideas. I would not have been able to overcome countless false starts without their contributions and their support. Ryan also helped me begin talking about these ideas publicly in our Bitcoin 2021 talk. Afsheen Bigdeli, Allen Farrington, Joe Kelly, Gigi, Tuur Demeester, and Marty Bent, have all encouraged me over the years and provided valuable feedback. I must also apologize to Allen for turning out to be such a lousy collaborator. Finally, Michael Goldstein may be better known for his writing & memes, but I\u2019d like to thank him for the archival work he does at the Nakamoto Institute to keep safe the history of digital currencies. Footnotes [1] The title of this series is taken from the first telegraph message in history, sent by Samuel Morse in 1844: \u201cWhat hath God wrought?\u201d.

[5] Hal Finney\u2019s RPOW project was an attempt at creating transferable proofs-of-work but bitcoin doesn\u2019t use this concept because it doesn't treat computations as currency. As we\u2019ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. [6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. [7] Dai\u2019s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi\u2019s white paper, available: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt [8]There are two simplifications being made here: a. The number of bitcoin being sold in each block is also affected by the transaction fee market, which is out of scope for this article, though lookout for subsequent work. b. The difficulty as reported by bitcoin is not exactly the number of expected computations; one must multiply by a proportionality factor.

You don\u2019t often see the term \u201cRoth IRA\u201d trending online, but in 2021, tech investor Peter Thiel made headlines for his $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA piggy bank. How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny. \u201cThiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.\u201d \u2013 ProPublica (2021) Let\u2019s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures. The different IRA structures The different IRA structures can behave in an \u201cevery square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares\u201d kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA. Brokerage and Bank IRAs Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The Unchained IRA is closest to this structure in this hierarchy. Self-directed IRA (SDIRA) A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn\u2019t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that are not allowed (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.). Checkbook IRA Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (\u201ccheckbook control\u201d). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA. Non-checkbook self-directed IRA A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA 1. Liquidity Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy. 2. Formation and legal structure When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account. With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA. 3. Misreporting transactions Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions. At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit fair market valuation (FMV) information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law. 4. \u201cDeemed distribution\u201d treatment Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of \u201cdeemed distributions\u201d treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC\u2019s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the LLC\u2019s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA. It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying \u201cdeemed distribution\u201d treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to IRS Publication 590, it\u2019s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. Read more about the McNulty case and its implications. 5. Prohibited transactions All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. \u201cSelf-dealing\u201d is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself\u2014not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide \u201csweat equity.\u201d It\u2019s not only the IRA owner that can\u2019t participate in any \u201cself-dealing,\u201d but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and penalties are stiff. These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don\u2019t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the IRS list of prohibited transactions here. Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors: Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets Leverage without a non-recourse loan Investing in certain collectible NFTs1 6. Financing Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons: Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases. Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits. IRA-owned active businesses could run into the issue of UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin mining within an IRA. Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA\u2019s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs. What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs? The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls. Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA If you\u2019re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It\u2019s not a \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations. There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it\u2019ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time \u2013 adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope \u2013 ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it\u2019s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the experience of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal\u2019s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0 is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions \u2013 but don\u2019t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network \u2013 we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we do broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork \u2013 presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we\u2019ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can\u2019t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) \u201cLayer Connector\u201d that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs! With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes) A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per \u201clayer\u201d (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.) The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the \u201cDispatcher\u201d. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn\u2019t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can\u2019t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the \u201cparent\u201d. In order for miners to capture the fees from this \u201cchild\u201d transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10\u2019s or 100\u2019s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we\u2019d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would: look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the \u201csplit\u201d transaction here: https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb. The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn\u2019t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas. Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. There are other aspects of the project that we haven\u2019t covered here \u2013 how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one\u2019s easy: it\u2019s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. This is a guest post by Rijndael.

The country has since bet big on Bitcoin, building Bitcoin reserves, mining BTC, and launching educational initiatives. However, the IMF has objected to the Bitcoin law amid loan negotiations with El Salvador, which needs financing to pay debts and obligations. Talks have stalled for nearly two years over the IMF's calls to limit Bitcoin's scope in the country. According to the IMF's communications director Julie Kozack on last Thursday, the \"risks\" of Bitcoin remain a key issue in discussions with El Salvador. The IMF has previously cited financial integrity and stability concerns about Bitcoin. The fund's opposition highlights a clash over the future of money and payments. While Bukele sees Bitcoin as an innovative solution for financial inclusion, the IMF remains wary of its volatility and decentralized nature, and a threat to their dominance. Irrespective of pressures, El Salvador has stood firm on its Bitcoin commitment. The country has invested over $150 million in BTC reserves, continually buying more. Bukele also pledged to purchase 1 BTC daily. The IMF loan impasse puts El Salvador in a difficult fiscal position. By tying loan access to changes in El Salvador's Bitcoin law, the IMF is exerting its influence over poorer nations. But Bukele seems unwilling to back down on Bitcoin, creating an ideological tug-of-war. El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin adoption signaled a shift toward decentralization and self-determination. Demands to roll back the Bitcoin law undermine the country's monetary sovereignty. The standoff illustrates the disruptive potential of Bitcoin to reshape global finance. While risky for El Salvador in the near-term, Bukele's Bitcoin bet could pay long-run dividends.","article_summary":"The IMF is reportedly demanding changes to El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin law amid $1.4 billion credit negotiations, underscoring tensions over Bitcoin's disruptive potential.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-12T18:17:16Z","type":"article","category":["El Salvador"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTg0MjMzMzU2NjAxMzM3Njg1/nayib-bukele-bitcoin-el-salvador.png"},{"article_title":"TD Bank Releases Commercial Explaining The Bitcoin Halving And Promotes ETFs","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"TD Bank subsidiary TD Direct Investing recently uploaded a video on its YouTube channel explaining in detail the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around April 19 or 20.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event. What is Bitcoin halving? The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors. Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients Ben Smith, –°–ï–û Immersion BTC 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving. 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I\u2019ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren. 5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that\u2019s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs. Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a \"hodling\" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income? Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment. 5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively. Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving Efficiency is Key: Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem. Strategic Planning: Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols. Adapt and Evaluate: Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards. Collaborative Mining: Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards. Leverage Mining Solutions: Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving. What is the difficulty of mining after halving? The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa. Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include: Mining Altcoins: While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue. Mining Pools and Services: Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects. Hardware Sales and Leasing: Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations. Staking and Masternodes: Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees. Blockchain Development and Consulting: Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting. Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments: Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies. Energy Trading and Grid Services: Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs. Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions: Price Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics. Speculative Activity: Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions. Market Sentiment: Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines. Miner Behavior: The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics. Macro-Economic Factors: External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements. Long-Term Outlook: Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest. While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved. Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition? Efficiency Improvements: One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs. Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing: Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability. Vertical Integration: Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams. Diversification of Revenue Streams: As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments. Hedging Strategies: Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions. Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability. Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions. To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events: November 28, 2012: Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. July 9, 2016: The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. May 20, 2020: The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch \u2014 a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years \u2013 will see Bitcoin\u2019s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. ~94% of the total #bitcoin supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days üëÄ Digital scarcity at its finest üöÄ pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024 Gold Throughout the Ages One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a \u201cfine man\u2019s suit\u201d over time. This principle, known as the \u201cgold-to-decent-suit ratio,\u201d can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga. While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man\u2019s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges. For example, the cost of verification \u2013 or assaying \u2013 gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value. Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous \u201dNixon Shock\u201d in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good. This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. Executive Order 6102 comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited \u201cthe hoarding of gold coin\u201d, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value. Bitcoin\u2019s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven? Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals. As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years \u2013 reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024. Source: Glassnode While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a store of value better than gold, it is certainly promising. This \u201cmagic internet money\u201d continues to rapidly gain on gold\u2019s estimated $15.9 trillion market capitalization. Gold\u2019s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals. Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its informational nature, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute. Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s network of nodes and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s rise as a monetary good \u2013 predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable \u2013 has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold\u2019s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement. While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time. Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s time to shine.","article_summary":"For the first time, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is set to surpass gold after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China. Hong Kong\u2019s new ETF has been in the making for several months now, and it\u2019s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it\u2019s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) already passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it\u2019s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market. Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of big players from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media reported that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city. Considering that there are already signs of diminishing ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis report $90 billion worth of transactions in one year? Source Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves many windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: \u201cIf you get scammed, don\u2019t expect our help or sympathy.\" Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions. It\u2019s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it\u2019s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they\u2019ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have invested heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that\u2019s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. Click the image to learn more. Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong\u2019s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin\u2019s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? As far as Hong Kong\u2019s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local banks shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. The South China Morning Post reported on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new \u201cGlobal\u201d initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to \u201covertake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\" A very tall order. And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the Post that \u201cWe have seen their data and we don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be difficult\u201d. He added that most global competitors are either \u201ceasy to use but not compliant\u201d, or \u201ccompliant but hard to use\u201d, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It\u2019s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to offer nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business\u2019 reigning champs won\u2019t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was reportedly mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city\u2019s own existing firms are confident that they\u2019ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? It\u2019s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It\u2019s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.","article_summary":"With Hong Kong asset managers somewhat reluctant to submit applications for the new ETF, a series of multibillion-dollar firms from Mainland China have entered the market.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-11T21:00:00Z","type":"article","category":["Bitcoin ETF","Hong Kong","Markets","Bitcoin Magazine Pro"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count. Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. \u201cThe early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for \u2018crypto\u2019 venture\u2019s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,\u201d said Calicott. \u201cWith a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.\u201d In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested. \u201cDue to cyclicality and bitcoin\u2019s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,\u201d Calicott continued. \u201cDespite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.\u201d TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.

Sound Advisory provides financial advisory services and specializes in educating and guiding clients to thrive financially in a bitcoin-powered world. Click here to learn more. One of the simplest and most effective ways to improve your financial situation: Don\u2019t get killed on taxes. Taxes are a major friction in most people\u2019s financial lives, and a little foresight and planning can go a long way. This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. Let\u2019s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies. Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back. The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how: KYC Compliance: All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings. Transaction History: Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions. Reporting to IRS: Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains. Legal Precedents: The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions. Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly. Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season. To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments. Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year. Source: Sound Advisory If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income. Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin\u2014bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. Strategies and Case Studies Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn\u2019t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. When accounting for transactions, it\u2019s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. The IRS allows for \u201cspecific identification\u201d accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item\u2014in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains. Scenario: Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000. With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000). With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000). HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case. These would be short-term capital gains, so let\u2019s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. It\u2019s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly. Tax loss harvesting Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we\u2019ll leave it here for future readers. In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price. Scenario: Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved. Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the tax loss carry forward technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains. If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain\u2019t so bad. Sign me up. I\u2019ll even pay it twice. And \u201ctaxable income\u201d is calculated after the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single). Scenario: Let\u2019s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free). And we\u2019ll assume that they live in one of the nine US states that don\u2019t have an income tax, so let\u2019s call it 0% state tax as well. It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free\u2014valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a strategic sell and immediate rebuy opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies Roth IRA conversions or liquidating assets through installment sales. Gifting We\u2019ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people. Charity When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed. Scenario: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he\u2019d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains. You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to have less bitcoin!\u201d If bitcoin holders are familiar with \u201cspend and replace,\u201d we can consider a similar strategy like \u201cdonate and replace.\u201d You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes. Donor-advised funds For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a \"charitable savings account\": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time. Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications. Friends and family Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you). Scenario: A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their \u201clifetime bucket.\u201d Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. Roth accounts Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability. If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings. If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution. Conclusion The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you. With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort. A note on wash sales The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin. Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended. Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit. It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency. 1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events. 2) These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. CONTACT Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

","author":"Ivan Serrano","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin has shown itself among the best-performing assets in the last decade. In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250\u2014a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset briefly touched $70,000 recently. With this kind of growth, it\u2019s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to \u201cHODL\" until it reaches new price highs. However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC? Bitcoin loans offer a solution that provides access to liquidity without letting go of your holdings. How does a Bitcoin loan work? Here, we delve into the unique mechanics of a Bitcoin loan. We discuss how the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the world of finance beyond trading by providing alternative means to secure loans while retaining access to potentially higher returns in the future. Click the image to learn more. Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments\u2014similar to how a bank operates. Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent\u2014thus becoming overcollateralized loans. How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings. Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: Risks associated with rehypothecation Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties. With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral\u2014or even 100 percent\u2014is at risk. Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on. Annual percentage rate (APR) The annual percentage rate, also known as the APR, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. LTV requirement The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates. Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV) The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. Tax implications Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best.

The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don\u2019t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification. Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.

Or is it the Laser-Eyed Maxis? Or is it both? The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it\u2019s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don\u2019t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn\u2019t have that, you likely didn\u2019t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. That dogma was necessary \u2014 without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn\u2019t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. Click the image above to subscribe! Which Church Do You Go To? The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn\u2019t die \u2014 it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn\u2019t destroy it \u2014 they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther\u2019s famous Theses. What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. The Protestants\u2019 Disgust With Indulgences So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let\u2019s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences \u2014 the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, \u201cAs soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs\u201d. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. \u201cJust follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.\u201d Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they\u2019re undeniable. In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that \u201cthis one simple trick\u201d is enough to guarantee an individual\u2019s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can\u2019t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It\u2019s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. Here\u2019s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn\u2019t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people \u2014 roughly the same size as the Catholic population \u2014 Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther\u2019s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one\u2019s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn\u2019t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. Dissent Breeds Dissent Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn\u2019t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it\u2019s simply a matter of survival. And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single \u201cProtestant\u201d dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as \u201cagainst\u201d the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as \u201cdoing what the Laser Eyes couldn\u2019t\u201d as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around \u201cowning the Laser Eyes\u201d. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? The JPEG People claim they are here to \u201cmake Bitcoin fun again\u201d, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to \u201cown the Laser Eyes\u201d. That doesn\u2019t produce anything of value. That doesn\u2019t actually inspire people with a vision. Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own. So what is the identity of the JPEG People without Laser Eyes to troll? Is there even one there when you take that away?

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it\u2019s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they\u2019ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network. The Liquidity Crunch The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator\u2019s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. For now let\u2019s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they should have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they have processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users\u2019 money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? The Options The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. So now that we understand the problem let\u2019s look at some potential solutions. Throttling You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. The problem with this is you don\u2019t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don\u2019t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. Multiple Operators Both BitVM 1 and BitVM 2 support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator\u2019s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator. It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren\u2019t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. Multiple Linear Operators In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. The Backstop In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users\u2019 funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist. So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users\u2019 funds and make them whole. I don\u2019t think this is that bad. Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users\u2019 funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. Wrapping Up At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users\u2019 funds, to losing operators\u2019 funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I\u2019ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first.","article_summary":"An analysis of the recent criticism of BitVM based two way pegs published by Taproot Wizards.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-10T01:40:00Z","type":"article","category":["Opinion","BitVM","Technical","BitVM 2","BitVM Pegs"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"},{"article_title":"The U.S. Needs To Lead in Bitcoin, Says Congressman Patrick McHenry","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington DC today, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) emphasized the importance of the United States taking a leadership role in Bitcoin and not lagging behind in during a fireside chat with Club for Growth President David McIntosh.

Japanese Public Company Is Buying Bitcoin","author":"Vivek Sen","article_detailed_content":"Japanese firm Metaplanet announced it is purchasing 1 billion yen (about $6.5 million) worth of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, a move that mimics MicroStrategy's high-profile Bitcoin accumulation. Metaplanet, a publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a diversified enterprise, revealed the Bitcoin buying initiative on X. The company cited hedging risks from currency devaluation and inflation as motivations. The announcement said the purchase is an \"initial commitment\" and part of a broader embrace of Bitcoin's potential. Partners like legendary hedge fund manager Mark Yusko, UTXO Management, and Sora Ventures support it. By adopting a Bitcoin treasury reserve similar to MicroStrategy, Metaplanet aims to benefit from Bitcoin's upside while mitigating risks. MicroStrategy has pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, buying over $6 billion worth of BTC since 2020. Metaplanet's stock price spiked 89.47% on Tuesday following the Bitcoin announcement.

Bitcoin Magazine is partnering with BPI to host a live stream of the event on its YouTube channel and social media platforms. With a lineup featuring politicians Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), Wiley Nickel (D-NC), Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), the summit is gearing up to be a nexus of Bitcoin and the political sphere in the United States. The participation of the aforementioned lawmakers underscores a clear bipartisan recognition of the importance of understanding and shaping the future of Bitcoin and digital asset policy work. Notably, Senators Lummis and Gillibrand have co-authored legislation in the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act. The bill, drafted in 2022, is a significant example of an emerging bipartisan effort to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Senator Gillibrand expressed her excitement for the upcoming summit, stating in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cAs a leader on this issue, I look forward to sharing my ideas and hearing from attendees on how we can write smart policy that allows for responsible innovation, has robust consumer protections, and enables us to root out bad actors.\u201d As the growth and economic integration of Bitcoin and digital assets continues, the summit's agenda reflects challenges and opportunities presented therein. Discussions will explore into the regulatory frameworks governing Bitcoin financial products and services as well as strategies to foster innovation while protecting civil liberties. \u201cAs a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I'm working to find common ground and advance common sense legislation on Bitcoin and crypto,\u201d said Congressman Wiley Nickel. \u201cI look forward to sharing an update on the work that we\u2019re doing and hoping to accomplish during the rest of the 118th Congress.\u201d Geopolitical considerations will take the stage in the \u201cGeopolitics of Bitcoin\u201d panel featuring SentinelOne Director Matthew Pines, BlockTrace Head of Operations Ken Egan, Bridger Solutions Co-founder and CEO Jake Langenkamp, and Foundry Vice President of Public Policy Kyle Schneps, as they analyze the implications of Bitcoin and digital assets for the dollar monetary system and global power dynamics. The summit will also examine the environmental and climate impacts of bitcoin mining operations. Panelists Troy Cross, a Professor at Reed College, and Brian Consolvo Partner at KPMG, are set to speak in a fireside chat: \u201cHow Institutions Consider Bitcoin\u2019s Sustainability\u201d. In addition, the use of geothermal energy will be a focal point as the Office Director for the Geothermal Technologies for the U.S. Department of Energy, Lauren Boyd, will also be hosted as a summit participant. \"The annual Bitcoin Policy Summit represents a unique opportunity for collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders from diverse backgrounds,\u201d stated David Zell, Founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute. \u201cBy fostering an inclusive conversation, we can develop informed and effective policies that support innovation while safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders.\" For more information about the annual Bitcoin Policy Summit, including the full agenda and list of speakers, visit BPI\u2019s website here.

One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. I really liked Dhruv\u2019s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows: Version 1: The Commonly Held View The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you\u2019d describe this is \u201c6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.\u201d Version 2: Dhruv\u2019s View ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term \u201creleased\u201d to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term \u201cunlocked\u201d for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv\u2019s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv\u2019s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. Why is Dhruv\u2019s framing important? By framing mining as buying coins rather than creating coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? If miners are creating bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an \"inefficiency of scale\" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *purchasing* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don\u2019t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. Layer zero is what I\u2019d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin that already exist to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn\u2019t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a \u201ctwo sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.\u201d The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price collectively for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers \u201cwins the auction\u201d using Dhruv\u2019s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES. The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, \u201cEach of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says \u2018what were the most recent bids in time?\u2019 and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.\u201d The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users and the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero? What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says \u201cit\u2019s computations for bitcoin.\u201d Layer 0 is a \u201cmarket between two aggregates.\u201d It\u2019s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two \u201cparticipants\u201d in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work. The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think \u201chow wasteful,\" think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv\u2019s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. There are some who believe that transaction costs won\u2019t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future.

This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything? If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. Verifying Things Yourself When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network\u2019s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network Most people likely don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s bitcoin payments, if you aren\u2019t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. The Supply Cap The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not the, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. Keeping Your Bitcoin Private Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else\u2019s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. Why This is All Important While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits. Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don\u2019t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else\u2019s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin\u2019s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it\u2019s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador\u2019s government uses Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, multiple defenses of Lightning\u2019s long-term viability as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network grew to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users\u2019 money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to question if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly quit the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes both the protocol\u2019s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, \u201ceveryone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people\u201d to Lightning, a \u201cmicroscopic\u201d amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, \u201calmost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it\u201d amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning\u2019s future prospects has emerged, as the network\u2019s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high. Source Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued optimism and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay secured $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes. This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase finalized a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange\u2019s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark\u2019s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to \u201cinscribe\u201d unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to inscribe discontinued video games. Download the full 20-page research report prepared by Tuur Demeester (Founder, Adamant Research) for Unchained. This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, claimed that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a \u201cvulnerability\u201d in Bitcoin, one that is being \u201cexploited... to spam the blockchain.\" The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been linked to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to \u201cfix\u201d this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals\u2019 continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance quoted their \u201congoing efforts to streamline product offerings\u201d as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning\u2019s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin\u2019s usability, while Ordinals\u2019 critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it\u2019s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr\u2019s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly rejected by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even endorsed Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a \u201crenaissance\u201d in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin\u2019s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain\u2019s flexibility and superiority over its competitors. Praise like this from such an important source could truly be groundbreaking. Events like this serve, more than anything, to prove once again that Bitcoin\u2019s spirit is not merely posed to disrupt established industries and build a more rational order on the wreckage. Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin\u2019s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It\u2019s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.","article_summary":"The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a \u201cdead end\u201d as capacity drops.

The halving (also known as the \u201cHalvening\u201d) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the \u201cblock subsidy\u201d) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain. The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin\u2019s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. . WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING? The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period \u2014 or epoch \u2014 will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE Determine the block interval: While it\u2019s true that Bitcoin\u2019s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments. Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you\u2019re running one. Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin\u2019s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height. Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving. Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected. Current block height: can be found here. Block time: can be found here. Current date: xx/xx/xxxx Blocks per epoch: 210,000 Next halving block height: 210,000 times next halving number Calculation: (((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it\u2019s important to keep running the calculation. HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS As of March 2024, there have been three Bitcoin halvings: On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. On July 9, 2016, the second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. On May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. BITCOIN HALVING 2012 The 2012 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s first halving. Halving: Date: November 28, 2012 Halving number: 01 Block height: 210,000 Block reward: 25 Mined supply: 10,500,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 5,250,000 Percentage of mined supply: 25% BITCOIN HALVING 2016 The 2016 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s second halving. Halving: Date: July 9, 2016 Halving number: 01 Block height: 420,000 Block reward: 12.5 Mined supply: 15,750,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 2,625,000 Percentage of mined supply: 12.5% BITCOIN HALVING 2020 The 2020 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s third halving.

Halving: Date: April 19, 2024 (estimated) Halving number: 04 Block height: 840,000 Block reward: 3.125 Mined supply: 19,687,500 (amount of bitcoin issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 656,250 Percentage of mined supply: 3.125% FUTURE BITCOIN HALVINGS The blocktime variable will introduce some variance in estimated halving dates, but it is possible to project approximate dates until the conclusion of block subsidies in 2140. Below, we provide a succinct overview of anticipated halving dates from 2024 to 2060, offering valuable insights into these upcoming milestones. Epoch Number Block height Halving Year Estimated Halving Date 04 (of 32) 840,000 2024 April 20, 2024 05 (of 32) 1,050,000 2028 2028 06 (of 32) 1,260,000 2032 2032 07 (of 32) 1,470,000 2036 2036 08 (of 32) 1,680,000 2040 2040 09 (of 32) 1,890,000 2044 2044 10 (of 32) 2,100,000 2048 2048 11 (of 32) 2,310,000 2052 2052 12 (of 32) 2,520,000 2056 2056 (cont\u2026) HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BITCOIN HALVING Halving events have consistently preceded significant increases in bitcoin\u2019s price, making them a focal point for market analysts. Price Appreciation Historically, bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced significant upswings following halving events due to the combination of reduced supply and increased demand. These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events. After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800. After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000. Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years. Challenges for Miners Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network\u2019s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin\u2019s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. FAQs: Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin\u2019s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it\u2019s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling. Is Bitcoin halving bullish? The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it\u2019s wise to remember that bitcoin\u2019s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak? A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. Should you buy bitcoin before the halving? Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it\u2019s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles.","article_summary":"As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway.

Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history. Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead. On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1 EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. As such, it\u2019s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners\u2019 interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it\u2019s the quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it\u2019s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody. Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there\u2019s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don\u2019t pay your taxes. For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again. However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on why FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR\u2019s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that \u201cwithout his New Deal, we would all have been lost.\u201d2 On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and \u201caccustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.\u201d3 All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is how FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. This is because, despite the fact that FDR\u2019s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America\u2019s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), \u201crule by personal decree\u201d4, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher. This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans\u2019 rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency \u201cNow, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes\u201d - Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses I\u2019m not sure anyone\u2019s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole not been Machiavellian enough, but in this case the historical record is clear. Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), \u2018disregarding the laws for good objects\u2019 has been practically a job requirement of the oval office. Carl Schmitt said that \u201cSovereign is he who decides on the exception.\u201d Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit \u2018extra-constitutional\u2019 exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt\u2019s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice. In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp. The phrase is \u201cnational emergency\u201d. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you\u2019re an American adult, it\u2019s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the \u2018anti-terrorism\u2019 provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19. In fact, it\u2019s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the \u2018national emergency\u2019 has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 National Emergencies Act. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.5 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States To give you a sense of the temporal nature of these \u2018emergencies\u2019, there are still in effect: 9 from the Obama administration, 10 from Bush II, 5 from Clinton, and even one from Jimmy Carter in 1979! This is what Milton Friedman was talking about when he said \u201cNothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.\u201d This is also the story of Executive Order 6102, for it too sprouted from an official national emergency. You can read this in order itself, where FDR states in the preamble: \u201cI, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist\u2026\u201d Executive Order 6102, 5 April 1933 But still, the story goes deeper. It\u2019s not just enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case in 1933. So what was FDR\u2019s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold? The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first. The Beginning: Principled Piracy In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia. About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the Rapid, to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the Jefferson, who claimed the ship\u2019s goods as a prize. Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the Jefferson. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.6 Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. \u201cBut\u201d, (I hear you interject), \u201cBy what definition could an \u2018American with gold\u2019 be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn\u2019t even a war in 1933!\u201d Fantastic points, and you\u2019re right to make them. To preface the answer, let\u2019s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major \u2018philosophies\u2019 that you might subscribe to. Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn\u2019t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these \u2018philosophies\u2019 help judges decide the \u2018right\u2019 way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that\u2019s another story). If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A \u2018Living Constitution\u2019 approach: where you basically say, \u2018to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today\u2019. The third approach is more or less how the law around \u2018national emergencies\u2019 has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate \u2018natural selection\u2019 evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast. So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. Now let\u2019s fill in the gaps and show how that happened. 1917: National Emergencies Go Up There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five. One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the Espionage Act, was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today. This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under. 1917 was also the first time the phrase \u201cnational emergency\u201d passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America\u2019s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.7 Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin\u2019 violation. This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since The Rapid, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle. The solution was the Trading with the Enemy Act, which brought the principle of The Rapid into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to \u201cdefine, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.\u201d8 In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.9 Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, \u201cperhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.\u201d10 This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives. For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.11 Source: New York Herald on March 28, 1918, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ This was all authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story. That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in \u201cforeign exchange\u201d, or by any foreign country.12 You might sense now that we\u2019re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness. But we\u2019re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President\u2019s power in 1917 was still limited to \u201cduring the time of war.\u201d13 It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it. Great Depression: FDR\u2019s Opportunity That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis. Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank\u2019s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would \u201cno longer take responsibility\u201d for the bank\u2019s \u201cdeficient reserves\u201d.14 What was going on? Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a \u2018gold standard\u2019 was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.15 The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country. However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government\u2019s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. Meanwhile, \u201call of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.\u201d16 FDR\u2019s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. He called out the \u201cunscrupulous money changers\u201d, and the \u201cfalsity of material wealth\u201d, and demanded that \u201cthere must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\u201d17 Now, if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a \u201cbroad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.\u201d18 It was all downhill from there. Two days after FDR\u2019s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a \u2018Bank Holiday\u2019 from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the \u201choarding\u201d.19 Stopping the run wasn\u2019t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting \u201cthe names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.\u201d20 On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate \u201cany transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.\u201d21 Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the Trading with the Enemy Act restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR\u2019s inaugural address, the Emergency Banking Act (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality. Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce \u201cduring time of war\u201d, or crucially, \u201cduring any other period of national emergency declared by the President.\u201d FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: \u201cHOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty\u201d22 This brings us to the end of the story. From The Rapid, to the Trading with the Enemy Act, to the Emergency Banking Act, to Executive Order 6102. The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn\u2019t. Conclusion: Could It Happen Again? Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin? Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes. The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn\u2019t control; Government wasn\u2019t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff. The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024. This isn\u2019t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either. The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. What does the next national emergency look like? A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities23 trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? We don\u2019t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate. In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of Alice in Wonderland\u2019s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff. Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a chance at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation. So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins. And see you in hell, FDR.

They want to be the first wirehouse to fully approve the #Bitcoin ETF's. - @MorganStanley may announce a few days before @UBS. - interesting that global banks are talking about $BTC ETF's\u2026 \u2014 Andrew (@AP_Abacus) April 3, 2024 Initially skeptical, Bloomberg's Balchunas agreed the firms are playing a \"compliance game of chicken\" on Bitcoin ETF approvals. But a UBS spokesperson reached out to Bitcoin Magazine for comment, stating that \u201cUBS has no plans to change the conditions for offering spot bitcoin ETFs to clients,\u201d and that the above \u201csocial media reports regarding UBS are not accurate.\u201d A potential upcoming Morgan Stanley launch would mark a major milestone for Bitcoin's mainstream acceptance. Morgan Stanley adding BTC ETF trading would be a stunning U-turn after CEO James Gorman said last year he didn't think Bitcoin had much uptake as an institutional asset class. Access could be imminent, pending strict compliance reviews. But a green light would still represent a watershed moment for Bitcoin. Major wealth managers offering ETF trading would convey growing confidence in Bitcoin's longevity and expose millions of new investors to the market. Being a leader in Bitcoin ETFs could attract billions in new client assets. The moves also signal growing confidence in Bitcoin's longevity among the world's banking elite. The accelerating FOMO to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs for giants like Morgan Stanley further validates Bitcoin's promise. Other wealth managers will likely quickly follow their lead. As game theory takes hold, Bitcoin's march towards the mainstream financial system gains irresistible momentum. Significant bank adoption may be closer than many imagine.","article_summary":"Morgan Stanley is racing to become the first major U.S. bank to fully approve Bitcoin ETF trading, a pivotal move for Bitcoin adoption.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/report-morgan-stanley-ubs-bitcoin-etfs-all-clients","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-04T20:33:24Z","type":"article","category":["Business"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/report-morgan-stanley-ubs-bitcoin-etfs-all-clients","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTAwMjYxMDk4MDcxNTkw/moran.jpg"},{"article_title":"Decentralization and Localized Manufacturing: Bitcoin, AI and 3D printing","author":"Emile Phaneuf","article_detailed_content":"In the 1997 book The Sovereign Individual, William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson make a convincing case that again and again throughout history, the dominant power of the day was disrupted by new technologies. Advances in agriculture meant that people and their property were often geographically stationary, making them sitting ducks for \u201cspecialists in violence\u201d, the predecessors to modern governments, who back then, were both the plunderers and protectors against plunder. The stirrup, contoured saddle, spur, and curb bit had a combined similar disrupting effect, shifting power away from heavy cavalry to a single armed knight. The Gunpowder Revolution disrupted the feudal order of the day, reinforced in those days by the Catholic Church. Rees-Mogg and Davidson write, \u201cthe Church tended to make religious virtues of its own economic interests, while militating against the development of manufacturing and independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal system.\u201d The printing press disrupted the Church even further: causing it to lose its monopoly on biblical narrative. The result was a major loss in its influence and power, which gave way to the modern nation state. Rees-Mogg and Davidson argue that the microprocessor would inevitably disrupt the nation state in the same way that the printing press disrupted Christendom a few hundred years ago. The internet itself (a globally-interconnected community) and public key cryptography (which protects both communications and property of Bitcoin) are made possible by microprocessors. The present and future One major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the currency front. Since Bitcoin\u2019s 2009 inception, we have been able to transact permissionlessly, borderlessly, and (often) anonymously. Nation states have long been jealous of any challenge to their monopoly on money, and they will spend vast sums of money to ensure that there are no serious monetary rivals. Bitcoin serves as an alternative to that trap, which is why it is under attack by the likes of politicians and the crumbling legacy media. But to transact on Bitcoin, you need miners. No doubt, regulators in the United States and Europe observed as China outlawed Bitcoin mining in 2021, which only resulted in the majority of the hashing power moving from that country to the United States. So while they would probably wish to ban it in the United States and Europe outright, they know that they would only lose both regulatory control and tax revenue from Bitcoin miners by doing so. Thus, for now, not even Elizabeth Warren \u2013 the most Bitcoin-hostile legislator in Washington \u2013 proposes to outright ban Bitcoin. Instead, she proposes to expand know-your-customer (KYC) rules to essentially all parties within the Bitcoin ecosystem as well as discourage self-custody and privacy-enhancing technologies. Bitcoin does have an important weak point of centralization (for now): the hardware. The University of Cambridge produces industry reports on Bitcoin mining and communicates that, hardware-wise, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin miners report to use an \u201cASIC\u201d chip for mining Bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 hashing algorithm produced by Singapore-based company Bitmain, with competitors MicroBT and Canaan trailing behind. Regardless of where Bitmain produces its ASIC chips, the ideal scenario for Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization would be that production of ASIC miners (and the mining itself for that matter) would be dispersed around the world so that no specific region could have a definitive advantage, taking the majority control of the hashing power. A reasonable compromise would be one in which ASIC miners were produced, at scale and in high quality, by at least more manufacturers than there are now, especially across countries that are not politically aligned with one another so that collusion between them would be increasingly unlikely. A second major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) front. I once attended a conference in which Peter Thiel participated as a speaker. He said something very close to the following (quoted from my memory): \u201cBitcoin is a technology that, on net, favors the individual. AI is a technology that, on net, favors the state.\u201d It is the latter technology and its favoring the state that emphasizes the importance of getting it into the hands of as many participants as possible if we are to build a truly decentralized world. One risk to AI\u2019s decentralization is one that Bitcoin has in common: a potential future scenario in which hardware is monitored and must be registered by law. In the case of Bitcoin, that would mean miners must register their ASIC chips. In the case of AI, it could mean that even you or I would need to register graphics processing units (GPUs) above a certain capacity (or, in the case of software, that matrices must be registered). Guillaume Verdon, the name behind the now doxed alias @BasedBeffJesos, highlighted this risk in a podcast with Lex Fridman, arguing that this could \u201c[stop] the open source ecosystem from thriving\u2026 by executive order, claiming that open source LLMs are dual-use technologies and should be government-controlled.\u201d Although executive orders could not kill Bitcoin (but could discourage some people from using it), similar reporting requirements for miners would likely, to some degree, impact Bitcoin\u2019s open source ecosystem. A third major battleground worth highlighting is 3D printers, assemblers, and other tools in the \u201cmaker\u201d arsenal. This \u201cmaker\u201d movement hints at a future solution to the problem of centralization tendencies for Bitcoin and AI. Imagine a world with 3D printers and accompanying tools in most people\u2019s homes. If you could print your own high-quality ASIC Bitcoin miners and GPUs for running large language models (LLMs), decentralization is light-years ahead. We can ignore for a moment the futuristic scenario in which 3D printers and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools are used to produce hardware for Bitcoin and AI applications. Even at present, at least one government is looking at the 3D printer with the same skeptical eye that the Catholic Church had for the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries. New York State\u2019s Assembly Bill A8132, if passed into law, would require criminal background checks, with fingerprints sent to the FBI, in order to purchase 3D printers \u201ccapable of creating firearms.\u201d It is reasonable to expect that various governments, fearing loss of their own centralized power, will continue to push registration and \u201cKYC\u201d requirements to maintain control of real-space tools that facilitate decentralization in cyberspace. Note: The Soviet Union had similar controls on seemingly harmless products such as books, photocopiers, fax machines \u2013 all of which facilitated the spread of information, and thus, threatened the regime. There were similar efforts to control the sale of fabric that could be used to build hot air balloons in East Germany, to stop people from escaping to West Germany. (See the 1982 American film Night Crossing and the 2018 German film Balloon that both document a real escape). Localized manufacturing, whether at home or in a so-called community fabrication laboratory or \u201cfab lab\u201d, is likely to come under increased hostility by various governments as 3D printers and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools are able to produce even more sophisticated electronics. But, for now at least, fab labs are growing exponentially in number, with well over 2,000 of them spread around the world so far, and even receive various levels of support by governments. These fab labs, by the way, don\u2019t account for the many more personalized labs in people\u2019s homes. Neil Gershenfeld at MIT\u2019s Center for Bits and Atoms tries to understand what the world looks like when almost anybody can make almost anything and when machines can make other machines, even machines more sophisticated than themselves, and often with locally-sourced materials. Gershenfeld argues in a podcast appearance that localized manufacturing doesn\u2019t scale and that production is generally for personal use, not commercial sale. But when many thousands of people around the world learn how to locally produce their own 3D-printed and home-assembled Bitcoin miner and then combine their individual hashing power with others in a mining pool and coordinate with one another over the Tor network\u2026 then the world starts to look much more decentralized. Conclusion Bitcoin, AI, and 3D printers share a common theme of decentralization and disruptive potential for the nation state. As both Bitcoin\u2019s ASIC mining chips and GPUs used to run LLMs exist in real-space where nation states are most dominant, governments may become increasingly hostile towards such hardware: requiring criminal background checks, KYC, etc. Interestingly, 3D printers, assemblers, and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools could be used now or in the future for localized manufacturing (whether at home or in so-called \u201cfab labs\u201d), enabling a much more decentralized world. Meanwhile, on the policy front, criminal background checks and registration requirements for 3D printers and other \u201cmaker\u201d tools such as those proposed in New York\u2019s Assembly Bill A8132 deserve a skeptical eye and strong political pushback.

It is a brazen attempt to assert foreign influence across Latin America and threatens to reshape the very fabric of the region and the day to day lives of its people. At its core is a serpentine set of contractual obligations, held at the municipal level, cast throughout Central and South America, upheld by an intelligence-linked satellite company, and controlled by a private sector consortium of green-washed financiers aiming to turn the region\u2019s forests into equity and carbon credits. At the same time, it obliges local governments to spend \u201cconservation\u201d funds on projects that further financialize nature and aid the construction of an inter-continental \u201csmart\u201d grid. One of its key ambitions appears to be further entrenching the debt load of the region through the multi-lateral development banks and the dollarization of the continent from the subnational level up through carbon markets upheld by a digital ledger. What seems like a technological marvel aimed at progress and connectivity harbors a darker agenda \u2014 one that intertwines planetary surveillance, financial predation, geopolitical maneuvering, and the domination of a resource-rich continent buried in debt. This grand design, known by the acronym GREEN+ and conceived by stalwarts of the digital dollar and debt schemes of the private sector, has quietly taken root through a web of political entanglements at the local level. Even a key figure in the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal plays a role. Astonishingly, every capital city of Latin America has eagerly signed on, apparently unaware of the strings attached to these seemingly benign partnerships, while a majority of municipalities in the region have also made commitments with these same groups that will push them to join GREEN+, potentially in a matter of weeks. The (hopefully) well-meaning regional governments have unwittingly paved the way for a sweeping surveillance apparatus tied to American intelligence that threatens to erode privacy and civil liberties under the guise of progress and combating the climate crisis. Upon further observation, GREEN+'s connections reveal a disturbing narrative of financial interests melding with geopolitical ambitions. The backers of the satellite company share ties with former members of the highest offices of US financial policy and regulation alongside the key architects and profiteers of private capital creation, aiming to consolidate control over monetary flows in Latin America within the redistribution of distressed government debt from the public to the private sector. As this two-part series will show, this concerted effort is not merely about surveillance \u2013 it's a calculated move towards further dollarization, tightening the grip of corporate and technological monopolies over the economic landscape of the Americas. The scheme's proponents also speak of how it will significantly advance the \"economic\" and \"regional\" integration of the Americas, invoking visions of unity while obscuring the true nature of their agenda for economic domination and stronger regional governance. Their model, eerily reminiscent of the EU's transition from a free trade union to a bureaucratic behemoth yoked to the US through the Eurodollar, sets the stage for unelected entities to enforce policies through programmable money, enabled by smart contracts on blockchains and designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. What materializes before us is not just a technological evolution but a quiet banker coup \u2014 one that lays the groundwork for land grabs and invasive surveillance under the guise of progress and conservation. It's a narrative that echoes throughout history, where intelligence-linked figures and predatory financial interests converge to prey upon the Global South, leaving a trail of economic exploitation and geopolitical manipulation in their wake. What masquerades as progress for individuals and the environment at large may very well be the harbinger of a new era of subjugation and control. GREEN+ The GREEN+ Program In 2022, several groups came together to launch the GREEN+ (Government Reduction of Emissions for Environmental Net + Gain) Jurisdictional Programme, the \u201cfirst program that will monitor by satellite all subnational protected areas of the planet\u201d and \u2013 through contracts with numerous local and state governments \u2013 propel and deepen the economic integration of the Americas through the quiet imposition of a continent-wide, blockchain-based carbon market. GREEN+ has been piloted in a handful of Latin American cities since its founding and is due to launch globally in just a few weeks time. Most of the GREEN+ agreements with \u201csubnational\u201d governments have remained focused on Latin America. Per the program, the subnational agreements have established the \u201crules and requirements to enable accounting and crediting with GREEN+ policies and measures and/or nested projects, implemented as GHG mitigation activities,\u201d with GREEN+ being described as \u201cthe planet's new subnational government advisory mechanism.\u201d Key to the program are the services provided by GREEN+ founding member Satellogic, an Argentina-founded company closely aligned with Peter Thiel\u2019s Palantir and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX that specializes in sub-meter resolution satellite surveillance. Satellogic, a contractor to the US government and whose founders were also previously contactors for the US\u2019 DHS, NSA and DARPA, will provide surveillance data of the entire world\u2019s \u201cprotected areas\u201d to GREEN+\u2019s governing coalition, composed of the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network, The Energy Coalition and other \u201crespected stakeholders.\u201d According to the press release that details Satellogic\u2019s alliance with GREEN+, the satellite surveillance data \u201cwill enable individuals, organizations, and global markets to accurately monitor the compliance of signatory jurisdictions to avoid deforestation.\u201d However, other information in the press release reveals that forests will actually be monitored for the purpose of generating \u201ccredible\u201d carbon credits to be traded on exchanges by GREEN+ on behalf of subnational governments. The press release also states that the GREEN+ alliance with Satellogic will \u201cadvance the future measurement of energy emissions in the most populated areas of the planet,\u201d i.e. the surveillance of carbon emissions from space. Satellogic launched some GREEN+-affiliated satellites in 2022 as part of its pilot and is due to launch the remainder this April during Miami Climate Week. Satellogic\u2019s past and upcoming launches of GREEN+ satellites were/will be conducted in collaboration with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, also a contractor to the US military and US intelligence agencies. Satellogic and GREEN+ Though framed as a way to develop economic incentives to mitigate climate change, the program is based on California\u2019s controversial and grift-prone cap and trade program and has been created (and is being implemented by) individuals and companies that are seeking to covertly dollarize Latin America and/or have deep ties to US intelligence. Its ultimate ambitions go far beyond carbon markets and seek to use satellite surveillance to enforce carbon emission levels in both urban and rural areas. It also seeks to impose a new financial system centered around energy, commodity, and natural resource \u201ccredits\u201d that are underpinned by extensive and invasive surveillance, underscored by the motto: \u201cEarth observation is preservation.\u201d The alliance that created GREEN+ includes the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network (GFN), Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s Catalytic Finance Foundation (CFF, formerly R20) and The Energy Coalition (TEC); the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas; the global insurance giant Lockton; the satellite company Satellogic; the \u201cgreen\u201d blockchain company EcoRegistry; the dominant carbon credit certifier in Latin America, Cercarbono; and Rootstock (RSK), the bitcoin side-chain protocol responsible for \u201csmart BTC.\u201d Several members of the alliance, though how many is unclear, now operate as part of a consortium linked to a company called Global Carbon Parks, which is discussed in greater detail later in this article and now manages major aspects of GREEN+. The NGOs (i.e. CC35, GFN, CFF and TEC) involved in founding GREEN+ are those who actually govern the GREEN+ program from California. As previously mentioned, the program takes carbon in \u201ceffectively conserved protected areas of a sub-national jurisdiction\u201d, i.e. a city, county, province, or state/region, and converts them into carbon credits. Per the program, \u201cthese credits are traded on the [carbon] offset market, and income is deposited in a trust fund\u201d that is controlled by GREEN+ and is known as the GREEN+ Trust. That trust is run by unspecified individuals who work for Lockton, Isolas and Rootstock. Alejandro Guerrero, head of Lockton\u2019s Argentina & Uruguay branch, is the only publicly acknowledged member of the trust. Another website tied to the GREEN+ initiative describes the initial process as follows: Public and private agreements between [a subnational] government and custodians are signed with zero upfront cost. Custodians trade the carbon units that are produced by the subnational governments (the public sector) signing contracts with the private sector in voluntary carbon markets. Those contracts signed by the subnational governments become smart contracts and carbon credits are then tokenized for traceability. The GREEN+ Trust holds government funds in escrow. Subsequently, \u201ca partial release of trust funds is made periodically during the crediting period of the jurisdictional initiative.\u201d From this \u201cpartial release,\u201d \u201ca percentage operational fee\u201d is deducted (the percentage is undisclosed in the program\u2019s documents) and paid to the GREEN+ program while a separate (and also undisclosed) fee is also deducted \u201cfor the operation of the GREEN+ Trust.\u201d Disbursements of what remains are made annually over a ten year period and, per graphs produced by GREEN+, those payments remain the same, fixed value even if the value of the carbon credits of the protected areas grows. From GREEN+ Between 40% and 60% of the funds actually received by subnational governments can be used to \u201cdesign and execute projects\u201d aimed at conservation, while the rest \u201cis allocated for new jurisdictional decarbonisation initiatives\u201d that can produce additional or \u201cconsequential\u201d carbon credits. These \u201cconsequential\u201d credits are then \u201coffered as a preferred option to the investors who initially purchased the conservation credits at a 50% discounted price calculated at the current market price.\u201d However, later in the same document, the program says that \u201cthe amount required for the initial implementation\u201d of conservation projects \u201cmay not exceed 20% of the funds allocated [from the GREEN+ Trust] to the jurisdictional initiative.\u201d Clearly, the amount of funds actually being generated for conservation-related projects is minimal and, even in the best case scenario, is less than half of the capital generated by the carbon credits themselves. However, as we shall see, these \u201cconservation\u201d projects must be done in conjunction with approved partners of Global Carbon Parks, which \u2013 like the organization itself \u2013 are tied to predatory financial interests and oligarchs with questionable motives. Of the funds that governments actually receive as part of GREEN+, half are officially meant to go toward conservation-related projects while the other half are meant to go toward decarbonization-related projects. However, on the Global Carbon Parks-GREEN+ website, it notes that the decarbonization projects must be conducted alongside Community Electricity, which forms part of Global Carbon Parks and is closely connected to the GREEN+ alliance member The Energy Coalition (TEC). As will be discussed later, TEC and Community Electricity are together attempting to build an inter-continental \u201csmart\u201d grid in the Americas and are also involved in efforts to develop \u201csmart\u201d cities and suburbs. As for GREEN+\u2019s conservation projects, the website states that \u201c50% of the resources received by the capital [city as part of GREEN+] must be used for social and environmental impact in protected urban areas with partners such as Cities4Forests.\u201d Cities4Forests was founded by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a World Economic Forum affiliate and contractor to suspected CIA front USAID that is focused on resource \u201csustainability.\u201d WRI is funded by the US and several European governments, billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg as well as Google, Meta/Facebook, the Soros family\u2019s Open Societies Foundations, the UN, Walmart, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, among others. WRI\u2019s Cities4Forests shares many of the same funding sources, such as the governments of the UK, Germany, Denmark and the US as well as the World Bank and the Caterpillar Foundation. Other funders include the Wall Street giant Citi Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Notably, the Rockefeller Foundation and the IDB recently teamed up to create the Intrinsic Exchange Group, which has spearheaded the financialization of nature via the creation of Natural Asset Corporations (NACs). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, NACs create corporations that take control of natural assets that were previously part of the \u201ccommons,\" such as forests, rivers and lakes, and then sell shares of those assets to Wall Street asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and other financial institutions in order to generate profit under the guise of \u201cconserving\u201d the asset they target. From GREEN+ Unsurprisingly, most of Cities4Forests\u2019 projects, such as those that would be built with GREEN+ funds, are similar to NACs in that they focus on using natural assets and \u201cnatural capital\u201d to produce new financial and insurance products. Examples of Cities4Forests \u201cconservation\u201d projects include the development of a Forest Resilience Bond and the India Forum for Nature-based Solutions. One of the India-based forum\u2019s \u201ccore partners\u201d is the Nature Conservancy, which has been run by Wall Street bankers for years and has pioneered the modern iteration of the controversial \u201cdebt for conservation\u201d swap among other \u201cnature-based solutions.\u201d The funders of Cities4Forest and its creator the WRI are also deeply affiliated with groups like the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and UN-backed climate finance initiatives that openly seek to use debt imperialism to herd the global economy, with a focus on emerging markets, into a new system of global financial governance. Thus, the \u201cconservation\u201d and \u201cdecarbonization\u201d efforts that subnational governments must enact as part of their contractual agreements with GREEN+ will go towards projects tied to either the smart grid/smart city developer Community Electricity or a \u201cconservation\u201d organization backed by Western oligarchs, multi-national corporations and banks that seeks to financialize and monetize nature under the guise of conserving it. CC35 and the Subnational Pivot CC35, or Ciudades Capitales de las Americas frente al Cambio Clim√°tico (American Capital Cities Facing Climate Change), is the most visible organization behind the GREEN+ program and one of the members of its governance committee. CC35\u2019s goal is the economic integration of the Americas (North, South and Central) through coordinated climate change policies, specifically the creation of an Inter-American carbon market, with GREEN+ being the means of implementing that market. The group focuses on \u201csubnational\u201d governments, namely capital cities of the Americas, thereby circumventing national governments with respect to Climate Change-related policy. Regarding GREEN+, Sebasti√°n Navarro, the secretary general of CC35, stated of the program that: \u201cWe will be relentless from the governance of the GREEN+ program with those who want to continue playing with the future of humanity,\u201d adding that their \u201crelentless\u201d approach would be greatly aided by Satellogic\u2019s satellite surveillance capabilities, which would also \u201cgenerate unprecedented credibility among investors of the carbon credits produced by conservation.\u201d Navarro\u2019s promise to be \u201crelentless\u201d in governing a satellite surveillance regime of American forests for the purpose of producing \u201chigh-credibility\u201d carbon markets. Sebasti√°n Navarro of CC35 While framed as an initiative \u201cborn out of Latin America,\u201d CC35 is registered in Miami; Florida (Coral Gables, specifically) and has long been funded and partnered with US-based interests. For instance, CC35\u2019s first partners were R20 (Regions of Climate Action, now the Catalytic Finance Foundation), a group created by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in partnership with the UN, and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. From there, CC35 partnered with UN and UN-linked organizations as well as Pegasus Capital Advisors, which also finances CC35 and Schwarzenegger\u2019s R20/Catalytic Finance Foundation. R20/Catalytic Finance, like CC35, focuses its attention on \u201csubnational\u201d governments. Pegasus Capital is the firm created by Craig Cogut, a key figure in the \u201cjunk bond\u201d financial scandal at the now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel\u2019s junk bond department, led by Michael Milken, engaged in blatantly illegal activity and used junk bonds to help fuel the takeovers of major corporations by the era\u2019s infamous \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d before the bank\u2019s collapse. Specifically, Cogut was the lawyer who advised the Milken-run and scandal-ridden junk bond department on the legality of transactions, including those that saw Milken become a convicted felon. Following Drexel\u2019s collapse, Cogut teamed up with a group of Drexel alumni led by Leon Black \u2013 now best known for his close association with the deceased sex trafficker and \"financial adviser\" Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 to co-found Apollo Advisers (now Apollo Global Management) in 1990. Cogut left Apollo to found Pegasus in 1996 and Pegasus has since became a key player in several UN-supported \u201cgreen\u201d finance initiatives. Cogut is also financially entangled with Satellogic\u2019s co-founder, Emiliano Kargieman, as will be discussed later. Cogut subsequently became a board member of Arizona State University\u2019s Global Institute of Sustainability, which was created by Michael Crow (and who served on the board alongside Cogut). Crow is chairman of the board of trustees In-Q-tel, the CIA\u2019s venture capital arm. Cogut also served on the board of ASU\u2019S McCain Institute, named for the late Senator John McCain, which has links to Ashton Kutcher\u2019s CIA-linked charity Thorn. Current board members of the McCain Institute include both Crow and former CIA director David Petraeus on its board, as well as Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who co-created the Council for Inclusive Capital with the Vatican. Cogut was also on the board of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), part of the Clinton family philanthropies, and CHAI was largely shaped and influenced by notorious sex trafficker and \u201cfinancial advisor for billionaires\u201d Jeffrey Epstein, having been the chief reason for former president Bill Clinton\u2019s flights on Epstein\u2019s plane in the early 2000s. Notably, Cogut is not the only Drexel alum to be involved in \u201cgreen finance.\u201d The field of \u201cgreen finance\u201d itself was essentially invented by Richard Sandor, who made millions at Drexel during the 1980s, pioneering \u201cinnovative\u201d products like the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), which would later contribute to the 2008 financial crisis. Sandor had previously been deemed the \u201cfather of financial futures\u201d and is also credited with helping create derivatives. After Drexel\u2019s collapse, Sandor moved on to pioneering carbon emissions trading and carbon markets with the vision of creating \u201can all-electronic exchange for carbon trading,\u201d a vision that has since taken shape. Craig Cogut of Pegasus Capital CC35 has long been led by Sebasti√°n Navarro. Under his leadership, CC35 helped broker the creation of the Subnational Climate Fund, which is backed by Cogut\u2019s Pegasus Capital along with BNP Paribas, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bloomberg Philanthropies and the governments of Germany, the UK, Australia and the Netherlands. That fund focuses on financing infrastructure projects in the Global South at the subnational (e.g. city, state) level, again bypassing national governments. Indeed, the main modus operandi of CC35 is brokering contracts between small, subnational governments and \u201cgreen\u201d finance entities that are tied to centers of US/European political or financial power. Navarro is listed as a director of CC35 as are two prominent, right-leaning Latin American politicians: Felipe Alessandri Vergara, mayor of the Chilean capital Santiago from 2016 to 2021, and Nasry Asfura Zablah, former mayor of the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa and former Honduran presidential candidate. Alessandri is a well-known figure in Chilean center-right politics and an ally of the recently deceased former Chilean president Sebasti√°n Pi√±era. Alessandri is controversial within the Chilean right for his covert support of initiatives generally favored by the left and publicly shunned by his party while serving as Santiago\u2019s mayor, such as climate finance/regional economic integration (via CC35) and his financing of initiatives related to illegal immigration. Alessandri\u2019s successor and supposed political nemesis, Irac√≠ Hassler of Chile\u2019s Communist Party, has since taken over for Alessandri as CC35\u2019s Vice President for South America. As for Nasry Asfura, he was the subject of a Honduran political scandal due to his appearance in the Pandora Papers and his alleged involvement in suspicious offshore finance activities. He was also indicted on money laundering and fund embezzlement, but charges were dropped under Asfura\u2019s successor Jorge Aldana, who is now president of CC35. The current vice president of CC35 for Central America is Mario Dur√°n, the mayor of San Salvador and a close ally of El Salvador\u2019s president Nayib Bukele as well as a member of Bukele\u2019s Nuevas Ideas party. Dur√°n is poised to take over the leadership of CC35 per a recent announcement from the group. In 2021, Dur√°n signed a contract with CC35 regarding education about the use of Bitcoin in all metropolitan region municipalities in El Salvador, and is the only mention of CC35 promoting the use of Bitcoin. As will be noted again later on, the CC35-led GREEN+ initiative is partnered with Rootstock, which created and develops a Bitcoin sidechain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presumably, the goal is to run GREEN+\u2019s digital carbon market on the same blockchain. While it may seem odd to an American audience that \u201cregional integration\u201d efforts under the guise of climate change would be led largely by right-leaning politicians, it is important to point out that such integration efforts have historically been led by both left and right factions in Latin America, who compete for dominance over the region. For instance, right-leaning efforts at economically and/or politically integrating the Americas include Mercosur (the Southern Common Market, now championed by the \u201canti-globalist\u201d Javier Milei) and Prosur (Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America, launched by Chile\u2019s center-right Pi√±era). Left-leaning efforts include ALADI (Latin American Integration Association) and UNASUR (Union of South American Nations). All of these efforts have failed due to geopolitical disagreements mainly centered around whether to grant membership to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and others with governments estranged from the so-called \u201cWashington consensus\u201d or, more recently, efforts to forge closer ties to Russia and/or China. Given that several important Latin American countries can suddenly change what side of the \u201cconsensus\u201d they are on depending on presidential election results, such as recently happened in Brazil and Argentina, these regional integration efforts have failed to gain significant traction over the last several decades. Nevertheless, the end goal of economic integration begetting political integration remains the same. Thus, as CC35 shows, the push to regionally integrate Latin America has now, very quietly, pivoted away from engagement at the national level to the subnational level. Aurelio Peccei at the 3rd Annual WWF Congress in 1973 The Club of Rome\u2019s Global Footprint While CC35 is the most visible face of GREEN+\u2019s governing body, it is actually chaired by a group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN). The GFN exists to promote \u201cthe Ecological Footprint, which tracks how much nature we use and how much we have, as an accounting tool\u201d for green finance initiatives and originated the concept of \u201cecological debt\u201d based on that metric. Elsewhere, the GFN calls for \u201cone-planet prosperity\u201d and emphasizes climate finance, a field dominated by predatory Wall Street banks and billionaires, as an economic imperative. They work with governments at both the national and subnational level and establish the carbon emissions limits for localities, states and countries that programs like GREEN+ seek to enforce with satellite surveillance and binding contractual obligations. The GFN is intimately connected to the Club of Rome. For instance, GFN\u2019s founder and a member of its board, Mathis Wackernagel, who also co-created the Ecological Footprint concept, is a member of the Club of Rome. Wackernagel\u2019s former mentor and the other developer of the Ecological Footprint, William Rees, was a member of the Club of Rome until 2018. Heiko Specking, a GFN board member, is also affiliated with the Club of Rome as is another GFN board member, Lewis Akenji. The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 by the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King. Its earliest success was the 1972 report and later book \u201cThe Limits to Growth,\" which was based on an MIT study and claimed that \u201cif the world\u2019s consumption patterns and population growth continued at the same high rates of the time, the earth would strike its limits within a century.\u201d The book was heavily promoted by the earliest annual meetings of the World Economic Forum, particularly in 1973. Peccei, who spent a large part of his life living in Argentina, had previously been a member of ADELA, the Atlantic Community Development Group for Latin America. ADELA was composed of powerful Western companies that pooled money to invest in Latin American companies of their choosing, essentially \u201cking-making\u201d the titans of the Latin American corporate world. ADELA\u2019s backers included Bank of America, IBM, Fiat (where Peccei was an executive), and the Rockefeller family\u2019s Standard Oil. The group was part of the Rockefeller-dominated network in Latin America, which also included the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), which has been linked to the 1973 CIA-backed military coup in Chile through the Chilean Rockefeller associate Agust√≠n Edwards, and Deltec, best known today as a main bank for the failed crypto exchange FTX and its close relationship with the stablecoin Tether. Modern iterations of this network include Endeavor and the Council of the Americas (CoA), which will be discussed in the second part of this series. Notably, it was Peccei\u2019s speech at an ADELA conference that spurred his partnership with Alexander King and led to the Club of Rome\u2019s formation. At the time he got involved with Peccei and made the Club of Rome, King was head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD was originally established as the OEEC to help administer the post-WWII, US-developed Marshall Plan and was later expanded to become a global organization in 1961. The US remains the OECD\u2019s main funder by a significant margin. The group has long claimed to promote \u201csustainable economic growth\u201d and \u201cconsistently improving standard of living in its member countries,\u201d but \u2013 in practice \u2013 it routinely favors neoliberal policies that enrich Western-based multi-national corporations. It is closely partnered with entities like the IMF, the World Bank and the broader multi-lateral development banking system that has used debt slavery sold as \u201ceconomic development\u201d to privatize state-owned assets and sell them off to privileged corporate interests. That system has also been considered by the US military to be part of its arsenal of \u201cfinancial weapons\u201d used to protect US interests abroad. The Club of Rome was criticized for many decades for embracing neo-Malthusian thought (i.e. eugenics and specifically population control measures in the developing world) as well as for promoting greater global governance. Some of its members have championed the imposition of a \u201cbenevolent\u201d global dictatorship. Criticisms of the Club of Rome have been voiced by academia as well as independent and mainstream media. The group\u2019s attempt to rebrand as an environmental group in order to gain popular support for those same policies was discussed in their 1991 book \u201cThe First Global Revolution,\u201d which states: \u201cIn searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.\u201d The Global Footprint Network\u2019s methods, products and ideology are very much aligned with the neo-Malthusian \u201cLimits to Growth\u201d view of the Club of Rome as well as the efforts to incorporate nature into financial markets via so-called \u201cnature-based solutions.\u201d Indeed, the GFN\u2019s ecological footprint metric is promoted by groups like the World Economic Forum and the World Wildlife Fund (where Peccei served on the board and which has long been tied to European oligarch and corporate interests). GFN also provides the statistical means of imposing Limits to Growth-style models that control both population levels and industrialization levels on governments by developing \u201cecological budgets\u201d that, as evidenced by GREEN+, are now interfacing directly with carbon markets. Building a \u201cGREEN\u201d Power Monopoly The other member of the GREEN+ governing committee that will control the program as well as Satellogic\u2019s surveillance data is The Energy Coalition (TEC). Notably, it was TEC\u2019s executive director Craig Perkins who said that GREEN+ would also enable the surveillance of carbon emissions of populated areas, presumably via satellite. TEC was founded by John Phillips, who ran Phillips Energy \u2013 an oil and gas company, in 1975. Since 1979, it has been closely partnered with local California governments via its Community Energy Partnership program. Currently, TEC is partnered with, and some of its key initiatives are financed by, major California gas companies, referred to by TEC as California\u2019s \u201cinvestor-owned utilities.\u201d These include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, SDGE and SoCalGas. With the backing of these major oil and gas companies, TEC assures us it is \u201ccreating the building blocks for a new energy economy.\u201d One of its main partners in doing so is Community Electricity, which claims to be \u201cbuilding the NASDAQ of the clean energy field.\u201d TEC and Community Electricity, which is backed by Google, have co-designed \u201ca master plan\u201d financed by the California Energy Commission \u201cto implement the largest and first-of-its-kind decarbonization by electrification protocols using DERs [distributed energy resources], carbon emissions management, blockchain, AI and IoT [internet of things] all connected under one plug-and-play platform.\u201d Community Electric designs, funds and develops this technology for GluHomes (formerly GluEnergy), its parent company which shares the same founder as Community Electricity \u2013 Felipe Cano. The program is being piloted in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as well as in disadvantaged communities in Colombia. The goal, per Cano, is to \u201cbring the Americas together\u201d through an inter-continental, \u201cclean\u201d smart grid. Helena Donoso, Samuel Garcia, Felipe Cano, Santiago F. Maldonado, and Sebastian Navarro The blockchain involved in these efforts is RSK, the smart contract-oriented sidechain that runs on top of the Bitcoin network. As previously mentioned, RSK is a founding member of GREEN+. The initiative involving TEC, Community Electricity, California\u2019s government, and RSK also seeks \u201cto digitize carbon credit reporting\u201d and to \u201ccreate opportunities for businesses to redeem credits.\u201d The Community Electricity/TEC program also uses the RSK blockchain to record a person\u2019s energy usage \u201cwith the help of RIF, an identity product [i.e. digital identity] developed by RSK Labs.\u201d The Community Electricity system requires a digital ID tied to a digital wallet that \u201cis embedded to store daily profits derived from surplus energy sales\u201d that allow electricity consumers to trade energy credits and become what the company calls \u201cprosumers,\u201d with the goal of creating \u201can energy social network.\u201d The Community Electricity hardware produced with GluHomes also \u201cutilize[s] AI and machine learning to transform any home intro a smart micro electricity generation utility.\u201d The group is partnering with real estate developers to develop smart homes connected to their energy-related technology, with a focus on social housing and affordable housing, i.e. housing for lower income families. The goal is to connect together retro-fitted existing homes, new smart homes, a neighborhood co-op of electric vehicles and a reward-payment system called GluPay, which is partnered with Mastercard and Contigo, which designs products \u201cfor the unbanked, immigrants, homeless and disadvantaged population,\u201d with a focus on remittance payments. Contigo is currently in talks with El Salvador\u2019s government to have the company\u2019s \u201cPayments Wallet tied into the Salvadoran financial inclusion products.\u201d Contigo is run by Raul Hinojosa, an academic at UCLA who wrote a book entitled \u201cConvergence and Divergence between NAFTA, Chile, and MERCOSUR: Overcoming Dilemmas of North and South American Economic Integration,\u201d which focuses on \u201cthe impact of a potential Free Trade of the Americas Agreement.\u201d The creator of Community Electricity and GluHomes, Felipe Cano has also spent most of his career attempting to economically integrate large swathes of the world. For instance, in 1998, his vision was \u201cto unify both European and US stock exchanges under one platform and protocol, the create the smart grid of the equity market and stock trading in a bilateral, single network.\u201d This vision led him to create ECN Access, which \u201cwas the first tech hub in Europe to route the first block of institutional order flows from a European Bank directly to the NASDAQ electronic exchange without intermediaries,\u201d creating what Cano calls \u201cthe first smart grid every built.\u201d He then sought to \u201ccreate a digital market for the energy sector,\u201d which has since culminated in his creation of Community Electricity and GluHomes. Cano is an adviser to TEC and is also a senior partner at Silverbear Capital, where he focuses on investments related to smart cities. According to his bio at Silverbear, Cano is also CEO of \u201cOlidata Smart Cities LLC, a market-maker platform which uses nano-grids and microgrids as the underlying strategy to deploy the Internet of Things Protocol of the future.\u201d Cano was also, until recently, the president of Global Carbon Parks, which is a consortium of companies, the only known members of which all happen to be companies that founded GREEN+, with the one exception being Cano\u2019s Community Electricity. Global Carbon Parks, unsurprisingly, is now one of the main implementers of the GREEN+ program. Global Carbon Parks is also partnered with Aclima, a start-up backed by Microsoft and the foundation of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Global Carbon Park\u2019s stated mission is to \u201ctransform protected areas into natural equity\u201d via public-private partnerships, essentially admitting that the GREEN+ program it now helps manage is about financializing protected natural assets and resources. Felipe Cano - GluHomes Inc Global Carbon Parks \u201ctransforms\u201d these forests into \u201cnatural equity\u201d by measuring, certifying and trading carbon credits in conjunction with the carbon credit certification Cercarbono (discussed later in this article). Their partnership with Satellogic, which goes beyond but also includes the GREEN+ program, uses satellite surveillance \u201cto ensure the integrity of the preserved area\u201d which contains the carbon represented by the carbon credits. The company also promotes their integration with The Energy Coalition and Community Electricity to develop \u201cadvanced electricity communities\u201d that develop \u201crenewable energy credits,\" which the company claims will \u201ccontribute to local wealth creation.\u201d The company is partnered with a financial firm, which does the actual trading of carbon credits for both Global Carbon Parks and presumably GREEN+. However, Global Carbon Parks declines to reveal their identity, merely stating that \u201cThey are a financial firm that integrates technical, economic, and environmental solutions.\u201d In summary, the governance of the GREEN+ program and the group with control over its satellite surveillance data; are tied to or funded by groups that have long used debt as a form of control over the Global South in particular; seek to control the population size and the degree of industrialization in countries; are tied to globalist efforts to economically and politically integrate the Americas; are building a Bitcoin blockchain-based smart grid that surveils and limits energy usage and links energy usage to currency; and are integrating and tokenizing the natural world, including endangered or protected areas, into the financial system under the guise of conservation. Through CC35\u2019s Alcades por el Clima (Mayors for the Climate) initiative, over 15,000 local governments in Latin America have signed agreements with CC35 related to carbon emission trading schemes and limits, led by Brazil (5,564 local governments), Argentina (2,457 local governments), and Mexico (2,481 local governments). Presumably, those carbon neutrality/trading agreements will allow CC35 to push those municipalities into the GREEN+ program, if they aren\u2019t already planning to participate directly (many are). In other words, the vast majority of Latin America, unbeknownst to the vast majority of its populace, is already contractually yoked to one of the main organizations behind the GREEN+ program \u2013 run by interests tied to foreign banks, corporations and even intelligence services. The program is set to launch continent-wide in a matter of weeks. As this article and subsequent article will show, what has transpired is a brazen attempt to conduct a silent coup of the continent\u2019s natural resources, energy production, local governments and economy. The GREEN+ Trust and the Bitcoin Carbon Market The GREEN+ Trust, which is to hold and handle the profits from the carbon credits produced and then disburse them to governments if certain conditions are met, is to be managed by individuals \u201cselected from the members institutions of the [GREEN+] Executive Board\u201d as well as from Isolas, Lockton and Rootstock (RSK). According to GREEN+, the Trust is not only responsible for fund custody, but also \u201cthe regulation of smart contracts, in coordination with the certification standard [Cercarbono] and the monitoring of mitigation initiatives [conducted by Satellogic].\u201d The only known member of the Trust, as previously mentioned, is Alejandro Guerrero, the head of Lockton\u2019s branch in Argentina and Uruguay. Lockton, a founding member of GREEN+ and also of Global Carbon Parks, is the world\u2019s largest, privately held insurance brokerage firm that also provides risk management services, employee benefits and retirement services. They are owned by the Lockton family and the company \u2013 and the family behind it \u2013 are rather secretive. However, the company has been overt about the opportunities they see in the type of carbon market that initiatives like GREEN+ will create. In a 2023 article, Lockton\u2019s head of Digital Integration and Special Projects, David Briscoe, wrote that making carbon credits \u201ca stable and trusted currency\u201d would \u201crequire the support of the insurance market.\u201d This is because, as Briscoe notes, \u201cvoluntary\u201d carbon markets come with risks, particularly because \u201cof the financial values involved.\u201d Per Briscoe, these risks include \u201cnon- or under-delivery of forward purchased carbon removal credits,\" \u201cstart-ups involved in the voluntary carbon market may face insolvency risks,\u201d and \u201cfraud and negligence.\u201d Indeed, mismanagement and fraud has been a major driver of why carbon markets have failed to catch on despite relentless promotion and the adoption of ESG and climate change plans by many of the most powerful names in finance and industry. Instead of addressing the rampant fraud in carbon credits directly, it appears that the high probability of fraud and insolvency has been seen as an opportunity to create a new market for the insurance industry, with carbon credit insurance being framed as the only \u201cfeasible\u201d means of de-risking the fraud-prone world of carbon markets, which have been criticized by environmental groups and have been shown to have a negligible impact on climate. Lockton offers a variety of products related to carbon credits and so do its competitors, with the first such insurance having been issued by the UK-based insurance company Howden in 2022. That product was designed to \u201cincrease confidence in the Voluntary Carbon Market\u201d and was \u201cincubated\u201d in collaboration with \u201cthe Insurance Task Force of the Sustainable Markets Initiative; an initiative led by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales [now King Charles].\u201d Industry publications have openly posited that carbon credits are likely to be \u201cthe next $1 billion insurance market.\u201d Some companies, like Kita and Oka, were created specifically to insure carbon credits. Presumably, Lockton\u2019s involvement with GREEN+ means that Lockton will be insuring the mass of carbon credits to be produced by the program, which plans to harvest carbon credits from all of the world\u2019s \u201csubnational protected areas.\u201d In addition, Lockton\u2019s role as the carbon credits insurer means it will be involved in ensuring that those cities/regions that are to become part of GREEN+ comply with the program\u2019s stipulations in order to receive funds from the trust. RootstockLabs (RSK) Another member of the GREEN+ Trust is RSK, or Rootstock. RSK is a federated sidechain built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows smart contract functionality akin to the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the same programming language known as Solidity. In effect, this means that any smart contract that can be designed and authored on Ethereum, such as identity systems, dollar-pegged stablecoins, or tokenized carbon credits, can be \u201ctrivially\u201d ported to Bitcoin. The concept of Bitcoin sidechains was first introduced in October 2014 by a group of Bitcoin developers mainly employed by Blockstream, whose November 2014 seed round was led by Reid Hoffman, that gives \u201cbitcoins and other ledger assets\u201d the ability to be \u201ctransferred between multiple blockchains\u201d giving new functionality to \u201cassets they already own\u201d without compromising any of the security innate to Bitcoin's blockchain. RSK works by allowing users to deposit funds sent using traditional bitcoin transactions into a wallet controlled by a federation (in this case, a known group of Rootstock-selected key signers) that issues a 1:1 token called Smart Bitcoin, represented by RBTC, which fuels the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine), a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). RBTC is \u201cthe native currency\u201d of Rootstock, and is used to pay for the fees required to complete and settle the smart contracts or transactions that take place on the RSK sidechain. RSK was launched in 2015 by RSK Labs, which was acquired by RIF Labs before becoming IOV (\u201cinternet of value\u201d) Labs. IOV labs, as of last week, has rebranded once again to become RootstockLabs. It was co-founded by Sergio Lerner, who became the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s bitcoin core security auditor the same year he conceived of RSK, and Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar. Gutierrez is the current chairman of RootstockLabs, while Lerner is its chief scientist and they are the president and vice president, respectively, of the IOV Foundation, which enables \u201cinterventions that contribute to sustainable development,\" specifically the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on emerging markets and territories. A major goal of the SDGs is to create a new global financial governance system. That system has been described in recent years by top UN climate finance official, central banker, and ex-Goldman Sachs executive Mark Carney, as relying largely on programmable, surveillable digital currencies (namely central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs) and a global carbon market. According to RootstockLabs and its affiliated foundation, the group\u2019s mission is to harness \u201cthe power of digital technology, blockchain, and collaboration\u201d to \u201cbreak down barriers and create a more equitable society.\u201d They also state that Rootstock Labs was created with the intent of creating \u201ca new open financial ecosystem,\u201d while RIF Labs states it (along with RootstockLabs) is \u201ccreating a global financial system that works for everyone.\u201d Wences Casares - July 2018 Diego Gutierrez is a long-time associate of Wenceslao (Wences) Casares, an Argentine tech entrepreneur sometimes referred to as the \u201cPeter Thiel of Latin America.\u201d Gutierrez worked with Casares at Argentina\u2019s first Internet service provider, which Casares had launched, and then helped create the Casares-founded Argentinian online brokerage firm Patagon that was later sold to Spanish banking giant Santander. Casares, like Gutierrez, is a long-time promoter and early adopter of Bitcoin and is allegedly responsible for pitching the promise of Bitcoin to elites, like Bill Gates and LinkedIn/PayPal\u2019s Reid Hoffman. Hoffman once referred to Casares as Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d in terms of Silicon Valley\u2019s interest in Bitcoin. Forbes has even referred to Casares as \u201ccrypto royalty who ran with the original gang of Bitcoin OGs.\u201d Casares subsequently became a board member of PayPal and also part of Facebook\u2019s failed stablecoin project Libra/Diem. He is also a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. Casares was formerly a partner at NXTP Ventures, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Latin America, and he is credited with introducing the firm\u2019s founders to crypto. NXTP subsequently became a major investor in Gutierrez\u2019s RSK as well as another Gutierrez-founded company, Koibanx, a Latin America-focused asset tokenization company that \u2013 per its CEO \u2013 is at the \u201cforefront of redefining Latin America\u2019s financial system.\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s Koibanx has been instrumental in developing Bitcoin products and services sponsored by El Salvador\u2019s government as well as enabling the role of Algorand as an intermediary in El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin ecosystem. Algorand is also a major investor in Koibanx and is currently run by Staci Warden, who aided the cronyist privatization of Russia while at Harvard, oversaw J.P. Morgan\u2019s division of emerging market government debt and led crypto-related initiatives and \u201cglobal market development\u201d for the Institute of the mastermind of the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal, Michael Milken. Gutierrez\u2019s Koibanx has also launched a blockchain-based digital ID in Colombia with over 12 million users and is partnered with Nigeria\u2019s government on a crypto initiative where Nigerians can exchange their intellectual property (IP) for a \u201cstable token\u201d considered \u201cequivalent to the Naira,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s currency that has been completely taken over by the government\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. Both of those projects have also been conducted jointly with Algorand. Algorand is a member alongside PayPal and Amazon of the Digital Monetary Institute, which works with central banks, major commercial banks, and Big Tech firms to \u201cexamine the distribution and use cases of both retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies, tokenised assets, deposits and capital markets, cross-border payments and domestic interoperability.\u201d The DMI also focuses on \u201ccrypto assets and stablecoins.\u201d NXTP is also an investor in Ripio, an Argentina-based crypto firm partnered with the World Economic Forum. Rootstock co-founder Sergio Lerner sits on the board of Ripio\u2019s P2P lending subsidiary, the Ripio Credit Network (RCN). Ripio is backed by Tim Draper, who is on the board of the Netanyahu family-founded crypto company Bancor, Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, and Argentina\u2019s richest man Marcos Galper√≠n. Galper√≠n also sits on the board of GREEN+ partner and intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Galper√≠n is intimately connected to the \u201cemerging market\u201d entrepreneurial network known as Endeavor, the board of which is chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr. and includes Reid Hoffman. Both the Bronfman family and Hoffman have considerable ties to sex trafficker and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein. Wences Casares was previously on Endeavor\u2019s board and still maintains ties with the group. Ripio is also an Endeavor-backed company. Marcos Galperin at the World Economic Forum Galper√≠n\u2019s company, Mercado Libre, is considered the first Endeavor success story, and Galper√≠n sits on the board of Endeavor\u2019s Argentina branch alongside controversial Argentinian oligarchs, like former George Soros prot√©g√© Eduardo Elzstain. Galper√≠n\u2019s Mercado Libre is deeply interconnected with PayPal as well as Paxos, the stablecoin issuer creating PayPal\u2019s stablecoin, PYUSD. Mercado Libre\u2019s Mercado Pago subsidiary, Ripio and Brazil\u2019s Mercado Bitcoin (another Endeavor/Mercado Libre-connected company) collectively dominate crypto use in South America, especially its biggest markets \u2013 Argentina and Brazil. Diego Gutierrez\u2019s RSK and Wences Casares\u2019 Xapo, a crypto-focused bank founded in 2014 with a long-standing interest in Bitcoin and stablecoin providers, share a common tie in Joey Garcia, who is on the board of both companies. Garcia is also listed as being Xapo\u2019s Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer. Garcia is a lawyer for and head of the fintech team at the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas, which is also part of the GREEN+ group and manages the GREEN+ Trust alongside RSK and Lockton. Both Xapo and RSK\u2019s parent, Rootstock Labs, are based in Gibraltar \u2013 a UK overseas territory, where Garcia helped develop and lobby for crypto regulations with hopes of having that regulatory regime influence coming regulations in the US and Europe. Garcia is also connected to UN initiatives on digital currencies, with a focus on regulation and law enforcement. The involvement of this network in GREEN+ speaks to an effort to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain in the creation of a new global financial system centered around digital currencies and carbon markets. As carbon markets have developed, it has become clear that the carbon market which central and commercial bankers wish to build (with UN backing) will be blockchain-based and that carbon credits will be tokenized and traded on digital exchanges, such as the Goldman Sachs and Blackstone-backed Xpansiv, which is partnered with GREEN+ members Cercarbono and EcoRegistry. There are efforts to make Bitcoin the blockchain on which these markets (or at least key parts of them) will run, hence the relatively recent effort to create a more \u201csustainable\u201d and \u201cnet zero\u201d Bitcoin. RSK is clearly part of this effort, as evidenced by their involvement in GREEN+, where they are managing the smart contracts of GREEN+ carbon credits, as well as their partnership with the California Energy Commission and GREEN+ member The Energy Coalition on creating \u201can experimental market for carbon credit trading\u201d on top of Bitcoin. The importance of RSK within the maturation of the carbon credit market in the blockchain era is two-fold; the direct and immediate interoperability between tokenized assets representing green finance instruments and bitcoin, and the leveraging of the most distributed and most secure blockchain in the world, Bitcoin, as a universal ledger for the execution and settlement of otherwise impossible smart contracts. Rootstock allows Bitcoin the protocol to become the enabling and enforcing environment for all aspects of climate capitalism \u2013 green bond authoring and settlement, parametric insurance clauses, the tokenization of carbon emission offsets, and the issuance of dollar stablecoins that denominate the entire system and globalize the US Treasury market. Diego Gutierrez of RootstockLabs As recently mentioned, Diego Gutierrez of RSK was a very early adopter and promoter of Bitcoin and today runs Bitcoin Argentina while also being a co-founder of Latin America\u2019s largest and oldest Bitcoin conference. In an interview with Argentinian outlet La Voz early last year, Gutierrez stated that, in order for Bitcoin to become part of the global financial system that is emerging, there would have to be a \u201ctrade off\u201d that would mean stripping Bitcoin of its \u201cethos\u201d and \u201cpart of its disruptive potential.\u201d In other words, in Gutierrez\u2019s view, Bitcoin must cease to be a threat to central and commercial banks as it integrates into the system those banks have designed and uphold and will become their tool. There is perhaps no greater evidence of this than the recent pivot of BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink on Bitcoin and its promise as a \u201ctechnology for asset storage\u201d and the wild success of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. Gutierrez also tellingly stated in the same interview that there would soon be a move away from fiat and fiat-backed stablecoins to commodity-backed stablecoins that would make the companies and entities that control those commodities (which would include carbon in this emerging financial paradigm) more powerful than central banks and eliminate the need for central banks entirely. Wences Casares, Gutierrez's close associate, created his bank Xapo to help \u201csolve the disjointed nature of our world economy\u201d and to act as \u201cthe bridge between bitcoin, US dollars and stablecoins.\u201d As a consequence, Xapo has been a key player in efforts to dollarize bitcoin and has developed close relationships with Circle (USDC), Tether (USDT) and Lightspark, whose founder David Marcus invested in Xapo while head of PayPal. Marcus also previously worked for Facebook and co-created Facebook\u2019s Libra/Diem stablecoin project, where Casares was on the board and which was allied with Xapo. Xapo\u2019s initial advisory board was composed of former longtime head of Citibank John Reed, Visa founder Dee Hock and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. Summers is best known for his close association with Jeffrey Epstein and his role in repealing key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act at Citi\u2019s behest, which is widely believed to have provoked the 2008 financial crisis. While on Xapo\u2019s board, Summers became a leading voice behind the effort to \u201cput a price on carbon\u201d and implement carbon taxes and carbon markets. In 2015, together with these men, Xapo claimed, they would build \u201cthe global bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d The GREEN+ Registry Working closely with the GREEN+ Trust is the carbon credit certification standard chosen by GREEN+, Cercarbono. In addition to certifying the carbon credits produced by the program, Cercarbono also has a role in choosing which initiatives participating jurisdictions can implement with funds received and are also involved in fund custody alongside the GREEN+ Trust. Cercarbono was launched in 2016, shortly after Colombia \u2013 where Cercarbono was formed \u2013 passed a law establishing a carbon tax. Cercarbono\u2019s founders created the company because the law created a \u201cneed for a national certifying entity that would provide solutions to the climate problem.\u201d Further Colombian legislation in 2017 spurred the company to expand into carbon markets. It has since become a leading voluntary carbon credit certifier in Latin America. In 2018, Cercarbono formed a partnership with EcoRegistry, a blockchain registry that is also part of GREEN+ and \u201cdevelops services and platforms for reporting, monitoring and registering environmental assets and carbon units.\u201d The program says the company also \u201caddresses the issuance, monitoring and cancellation of the carbon credits generated by the jurisdictions in close coordination with the certification standard and the Trust Fund.\u201d EcoRegistry provides a unique serial number to each carbon credit issued and allows for close monitoring of that credit on-chain. As a consequence, it works closely with the lead of GREEN+\u2019s monitoring unit, the intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic. EcoRegistry is also a part of the Climate Action Data Trust, or CAD Trust. The CAD Trust was discussed in previous reporting from Bitcoin Magazine and Unlimited Hangout and is an effort led by the World Bank and funded by Google (among others) in an effort to construct what they refer to as \u201cclimate wallets.\u201d IETA, discussed below, is also a member of the CAD Trust. Tokenized, Inc. The World Bank has been exploring tokenization and digital ledger technology in order to create \u201ca modular and interoperable end-to-end digital ecosystem for the carbon market.\u201d Through the Digital for Climate (D4C) working group, the World Bank aims to build \u201cthe next generation of climate markets\u201d by directing governments to create National Carbon Registries reliant on blockchain technology. The data produced by these registries will be \u201clink[ed], aggregat[ed] and harmoniz[ed]\u201d by the CAD Trust. D4C itself leverages the Chia blockchain, developed by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen. Part of the D4C\u2019s \u201cClimate Tokenization Suite\u201d includes the aforementioned Climate Wallet to facilitate the exchange of carbon credit tokens, requiring an active connection to a Climate Action Data Trust node to function. EcoRegistry is also part of the Climate Chain Coalition, whose other members include disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann\u2019s new venture Flowcarbon, the Cardano Foundation, the Google-backed oracle service Chainlink, and the Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), which seeks to \u201cencourage [bitcoin] miners to utilize environmentally friendly energy sources using tokenization.\u201d The SBP aims to turn \u201csustainability into an investable asset\u201d when they create what they refer to as a Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate (SBC), a verified \u201con-chain environmental asset\u201d representing \u201cbitcoin mined using clean energy.\u201d The SBP website further specifies the incentivized opportunity for additional revenue streams for Bitcoin miners, stating that \u201cunlike carbon credits or RECs which are retired,\" each individual SBC is a tokenized asset which \u201cpermanently represents the sustainability of one bitcoin.\u201d Due to an upcoming 50% reduction in the rate of bitcoin issued per block \u2013 referred to as a \u201chalving\u201d \u2013 alternative sources of income for miners can be the difference between thriving and barely surviving in such an unforgiving market. While initially issued alongside the mining of every new bitcoin, the SBC itself can later be sold to other investors. Depending on future regulations of energy in relation to Bitcoin mining operations in the United States, non-mining businesses might look to purchase these certificates from miners as a means to offset the carbon footprint of their bitcoin holdings. In effect, the SBP aims to incentivize carbon neutrality for Bitcoin miners while simultaneously allowing investors to meet ESG goals while holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, the latter exemplified in their partnership with Bitcoin custodian BitGo. Their website explains that they \u201cbelieve Bitcoin has a unique potential to expedite the clean energy transition\u201d and due to being \u201cthe world\u2019s first commodity derived from a network,\u201d every bitcoin mined is \u201cfully fungible in both price and also carbon footprint\u201d \u2013 culminating in a \u201csustainability opportunity unlike any other industry.\" If a large company with a large carbon output due in large part to the sheer energy demands of being a multi-national company \u2013 traveling employees, large scale data centers, and simply offices that require electricity \u2013 was holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, they could purchase large amounts of SBCs to source yield on the appreciating certificate token while also generating accounting opportunities to reach metric-based ESG goals faster. The co-founder of SBP, Matthew Twomey, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, OSL and Deutsche Bank, while Head of Climate Strategy Elliot David previously held positions at the US Department of Energy, as well as worked with the Clinton Foundation within their Clinton Climate Initiative on their Island Energy Program. Listed among the SBP Advisors are Natasha Barrientos (S&P Global and the United Nations), Dr. Julia Nesheiwat (the Atlantic Council), Emma Todd (World Economic Forum) and Kelvin Chang (Coinbase and Microsoft). Cercarbono and EcoRegistry share several noteworthy partners and affiliations. For example, both are members of Asocarbono, an alliance of different companies and actors running or supporting Colombian carbon markets, that has written about the issue of \u201ccarbon rights\u201d within voluntary carbon markets. According to the UN, \u201ccarbon rights\u201d \u201ccomprises two fundamental concepts: 1) the property rights to sequester and store carbon, contained in land, trees, soil, etc. and 2) the right to benefits that arise from the transfer of these property rights (i.e. through emissions trading schemes).\u201d The issue itself portends the possibility that those who purchase carbon credits will obtain the \u201cproperty rights\u201d of the carbon sequestered in trees and other natural elements found in the area tied to those carbon credits, opening the door to land grabs through carbon markets. Notably, there is no clear definition of carbon rights and it is unclear, due to the fact that their contracts with jurisdictions/governments are not publicly available, how GREEN+ views the issue of carbon rights in relation to property rights. Source: AirCarbon. Note: Prices on October 7, 2022. EcoRegistry and Cercarbono are also both partnered with AirCarbon Exchange (ACX), \u201cthe world's first fully digital carbon exchange,\u201d established in 2019 with the Singapore Sustainable Energy Association \u2013 subsidized by the Singapore government's Enterprise Singapore \u2013 and backed by the UN. ACX was founded by CEO Thomas McMahon, an over 30 year veteran of the commodities and derivatives industry, having spent over 20 years at the New York Mercantile Exchange before establishing himself in Singapore, where ACX is based. ACX is Singapore's first international carbon credit exchange, chosen by McMahon \u201cdue to demand for carbon credits from the airline industry.\u201d The exchange uses distributed ledger technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain, to trade six different tokenized carbon credits, boasting settlement for \u201cas low as $3 per 1,000 CO2 tonnes.\u201d While ACX began mainly by focusing on the airline industry, the exchange now has over 160 clients ranging from financial institutions to project developers. Between January and August 2021, over 5.7 million CO2 tonnes were traded on the exchange. Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, acquired a 20% stake in the company, with the intent to build a carbon exchange in the UAE. ACX is also partnered with IETA (more on them below), as well as the Carbon Business Council, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). It can be assumed that ACX will be the exchange on which GREEN+ carbon credits will be traded due to its partnerships with GREEN+\u2019s credit certifier and registry. Both Cercarbono and EcoRegistry were also recently integrated into Xpansiv, which \u201coperates the leading multi-registry, multi-asset environmental portfolio management system and market data service\u201d as well as CBL, the \u201clargest spot exchange for environmental commodities, including carbon credits and renewable energy certificates.\u201d Xpansiv is backed by Blackstone, which poured $400 million into the company, with other investors including British Petroleum (BP) Ventures, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Xpansiv\u2019s CBL has partnered extensively with CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group, which is one of the world\u2019s main derivatives exchanges, and together they have produced several futures contracts on carbon markets. Cercarbono and EcoRegistry also both share an affiliation with the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA. Founded in 1999 under the auspices of the UN, IETA \u201cis dedicated to the establishment of linked trading systems to ensure efficient and competitive GHG [greenhouse gas] markets.\u201d Its inaugural members included the titans of the oil and manufacturing industries. Current members include AngloAmerican mining, Saudi Aramco, Bank of America, Bayer/Monsanto, Cargill, Chevron, Citi Group, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, PetroChina and the Mossad-linked commodities company Glencore. Another company that is a member of IETA is StoneX, which is partnered with the aforementioned exchange ACX and is sponsoring the launch of GREEN+ satellites in Miami later this month. IETA is also part of the aforementioned Climate Action Data Trust, along with EcoRegistry, the World Bank and others. IETA is also notably behind the ICROA accreditation program, which Cercarbono and most other carbon credit certification standards of note have received. These include the world\u2019s leading carbon credit certifier Verra, which was recently embroiled in a major scandal when it was revealed that 90% of their most common category of carbon credits were \u201cworthless\u201d despite being ICROA (and IETA) approved. Satellogic Satellogic - Observation Is Preservation As the digital carbon credit industry grows into a multi-trillion dollar market upheld by smart contracts on a distributed ledger, so too does the need for participants to access metric-specific data to insure the eventual pay outs of green bonds. For example, the company Atos, best known for its Olympic Games IT partnership since 1989, raised $916 million in sustainability-linked bonds at the end of 2021. According to a press release in November 2021, the bonds were issued with \u201can eight-year maturity and one percent coupon,\u201d with a clause that the annual interest rate paid during the \u201clast three years will be unchanged if the company reduces its annual GreenHouse Gas CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 & 3) by 50 percent in 2025 compared to 2019.\u201d While these particular bonds were not authored using a blockchain, there remains the now-sudden economic incentive \u2013 a one percent coupon on nearly $1 billion \u2013 to deliver verifiable real world data to the participants, the state of which determines the eventual payout. These bonds were issued with BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan acting as Global Coordinators and with Joint Bookrunners such as HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Banco Santander, Bank of America Securities, and Wells Fargo Securities, among others, with Rothschild & Co \u201cacting as financial advisor to Atos SE.\u201d An article from Data Center Dynamics on the raise makes note of the common trend of \u201csustainability-linked financing\u201d among data center and communication firms, referencing how NTT, Aligned, Airtrunk, KPN, Baidu, and Nabiax all raised \u201cfunds or converted existing debt to include interest rates tied to sustainability and ESG goals\u201d within the last year. Atos and techUK When the eventual payout of billions of dollars in cleverly-authored green bonds comes down to accurate measurements of carbon molecule density over a vast land mass, such as a South American rainforest, the market for reliable data service providers has quite literally left the atmosphere. As the debt instruments of the private sector evolve alongside the proliferation of blockchain technology, the data that makes these smart contracts execute to eventually settle the issued bond no longer goes to a human arbitrator, but rather a consciousness-free protocol that reduces a pair of potential outcomes to a single output. In the case of a sustainability-linked green bond, if the carbon emissions of a business are not empirically reduced beyond a relative metric at a certain time \u2013 both data points of which are determined at the issuance of the smart contract and thus willingly agreed-upon by both parties \u2013 the coupon on the bond is not paid out. With the carbon credit market presenting itself as one of the preferred debt instruments of the modern era, the aforementioned Satellogic \u2013 an intelligence-linked company focused on privatizing the data from satellite surveillance with an advisory board full of key players in the digital debt system \u2013 finds itself ready to act as a crucial pillar of the encroaching new financial system. Emiliano Kargieman of Satellogic Satellogic was co-founded in 2010 by Emiliano Kargieman, its current CEO, and Gerardo Richarte, its current CTO, after spending \u201csome time\u201d at the NASA Ames Campus in Mountain View, CA. According to press releases on their website, Satellogic is \u201cthe first vertically integrated geospatial company\u201d that is building \u201cthe first scalable, fully automated EO [Earth Observation] platform\u201d with capabilities to \u201cremap the entire planet at both high-frequency and high-resolution\u201d in order to generate \u201caccessible and affordable solutions for customers.\u201d Their listed mission is \u201cto democratize access to geospatial data through its information platform of high-resolution images and analytics\u201d to help solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems\u201d of which they list \u201cclimate change, energy supply, and food security.\u201d Other Satellogic documentation reveals that by \u201cdemocratize,\" they mean expand satellite surveillance from the public sector (i.e. governments and security agencies) into the private sector. Due to their \u201cpatented Earth imaging technology,\u201d Satellogic \u201cunlocks the power of EO\u201d to deliver \u201chigh-quality, planetary insights\u201d at \u201cthe lowest cost in the industry.\u201d Both Kargieman and Richarte previously worked for Core Security Technologies, which Kargieman co-founded, with clients such as Apple, Cisco, Homeland Security, NSA, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and DARPA. In 1998, Core Security was recognized as an \"Endeavor Entrepreneur\" by the Endeavor Foundation and in 2002, Morgan Stanley invested $1.5 million into Core Security, with the bank gaining a seat on the board. The company was also funded by Bank of America in its Series A. Kargieman later founded Aconcagua Ventures in a joint venture with Craig Cogut\u2019s Pegasus Capital, and served as a Member of the Special Projects Group at the World Bank. As previously noted, Cogut\u2019s Pegasus Capital is also a main funder of CC35. Another Core Security Technologies employee that migrated to Satellogic with Kargeiman and Richarte is Aviv Cohen, a former Israeli intelligence officer who is now Satellogic\u2019s head of \u201cspecial projects.\u201d Satellogic's seed round raise was funded by Ariel Arrieta and NXTP Ventures, Starlight Ventures \u2013 which Kargieman advises \u2013 and Santiago Pinto Escalier of Endeavor. As stated earlier in this article, NXTP is a funder of GREEN+ member Rootstock as well as the tokenization firm created by Rootstock\u2019s co-founder, Koibanx. Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns a significant stake in Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, invested in Satellogic\u2019s Series A as did Endeavor Catalyst, which is run by LinkedIn/PayPal\u2019s Reid Hoffman, and Valor Capital. Valor Capital, whose partners include figures tied to US military and intelligence activities in Latin America as well as CBDC development on the continent, invested in Satellogic\u2019s Series B, again joined by Tencent, with the Inter-American Development Bank (mentioned more than once in this article) joining in the company\u2019s Series C funding round. In July 2021, Satellogic went public with a $1.1 billion valuation through a \u201cmerger with Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s CF Acquisition Corp. V,\u201d with J.P. Morgan serving as the \u201cexclusive financial advisor to Satellogic,\u201d with a \u201cconcurrent PIPE offering of $100 million led by SoftBank\u2019s SBLA Advisers Corp\u201d alongside Cantor Fitzgerald and \u201cother top-tier institutional investors,\u201d including former US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin's Liberty Strategic Capital. Mnuchin\u2019s recently created venture capital firm, along with Softbank, are major investors in Cybereason, a controversial company tied to Israeli intelligence that previously simulated the hacking of US critical infrastructure in order to cancel a US presidential election and spur the declaration of martial law. Mnuchin\u2019s firm also includes Trump\u2019s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and previously attempted to recruit former Mossad director Yossi Cohen, who instead went on to join Softbank. Joseph Dunford, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump who is now senior managing director of Mnuchin\u2019s firm, is on the advisory board of Cybereason while Mnuchin is on its board of directors. Both Mnuchin and Dunford simultaneously sit on the board of Satellogic and Mnuchin is Satellogic\u2019s chairman. Satellogic Board of Directors Satellogic\u2019s board also includes Howard Lutnick, longtime head of Cantor Fitzgerald (as well as Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s neighbor and a major Clinton donor); Marcos Galperin, the founder and CEO of MercadoLibre who is closely associated with Endeavor, a Satellogic funder; Former Facebook and Twitter lawyer turned venture capitalist Ted Wang; Tom Killalea, former Chief Information Security Officer and Vice President of Security for Amazon who is also on the board of Capital One; and Miguel Guti√©rrez, a Partner and a Co\u2010Chief Investment Officer at The Rohatyn Group. Guti√©rrez previously worked with Nicholas Rohatyn at J.P. Morgan, where Rohatyn positioned the bank to become a leader in taking ownership of distressed government debt in the 1980s and 1990s, with a focus on Latin America. Guti√©rrez was involved with J.P. Morgan\u2019s debt markets in Argentina, before becoming its head of Latin America Emerging Markets and later head of Global Emerging Market Sales. The press release about Satellogic\u2019s SPAC paints a clear picture of the hefty value proposition behind the public offering, which boasts that Satellogic is the \u201cproven leader in Earth Observation\u201d with \u201c17 commercial satellites\u201d currently in orbit, more than \u201cthe next four Earth Observation companies combined.\u201d The satellite company's vertical product stack offers \u201cenhanced analytics capabilities\u201d with \u201ccommercial, sustainability, and government applications\u201d by providing a \u201clive catalog\u201d daily of \u201cevery square meter of Earth,\u201d providing \u201cvital information to power the conversation around global challenges\u201d such as \u201cclimate change, water and energy use, and food supply.\u201d In the SPAC press release, Cantor\u2019s Howard Lutnick stated that \u201cSatellogic is uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry. Its technology, data, and analytics have vast use cases across countless industries.\u201d Kargieman echoed these remarks: \u201cWe think this is a winner takes most or winner takes all market. This is a supply limited market \u2013 governments just can\u2019t get enough data today; there\u2019s not enough satellites out there.\u201d This is also true for the private sector. Satellogic showed CNBC a then-current investor deck which exemplified the true economic potential of dominating \u201cthe Earth Observation industry.\u201d Kargieman noted that the company had completed \u201ca pilot program\u201d with \u201ca major oil and gas corporation,\u201d in which the company required surveillance data for \u201cabout 1,800 miles of pipeline every other week.\u201d Doing this visual audit with airplanes \u201ccost about $750 per mile,\u201d whereas Satellogic \u201cdemonstrated similar detection capabilities\u201d for less than $60 per mile. While Satellogic failed to clear $0 of revenue in 2020, the company was expecting to see that \u201ctick up\u201d due to new contracts that began generating revenue in the spring of 2021. According to an investor slide deck, the company had a backlog of about $38 million in signed contracts around when they went public, but was predicting \u201c$800 million in opportunities over the next two years.\u201d In their full year 2022 financial results update, Satellogic CEO Kargieman tallied \u201c34 satellites in orbit\u201d making \u201cthe largest commercial fleet of sub-meter resolution satellites\u201d and thus \u201cwell positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Earth Observation data and satellites.\u201d Kargieman claimed their revenue grew \u201c42% year-over-year\u201d due in large part to their \u201cAsset Monitoring\u201d and \u201cConstellation-as-a-Service\u201d businesses. Satellogic's new Space Systems, or satellite sales business, \u201ccreates a satellite purchase program that aims to lower the financial barrier to Earth Observation spacecraft ownership\u201d according to CFO Rick Dunn. \u201cSpace Systems is designed to offer governments asset ownership to enhance national geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) with global tasking autonomy... Going forward, revenue will be driven by our continued growth in Asset Monitoring.\u201d Luciano Giesso, Sales Director for Satellogic has stated that Latin America is \u201can area of focus for us.\u201d He explained a current trend of Latin America being \u201cincreasingly focused on space technologies\u201d in order to \u201ccreate new infrastructures\u201d that \u201cunlock the benefits of satellite data\u201d throughout multiple industries. The press release states Satellogic's position is informed by their view that \u201ccountries unequipped with their own satellites\u201d are thus \u201climited in their ability\u201d to meaningfully \u201ccapture data about their policy implementation and infrastructure.\u201d Satellogic\u2019s Dedicated Satellite Constellation Program is specifically marketed as a product for \u201cstrategic national interests\u201d allowing \u201cgovernments of all sizes\u201d to create \u201cunique earth-observation programs\u201d to \u201csupport key decisions and manage policy impact, measure investment and socio-economic progress, and foster collaboration, data and information sharing, and innovation.\u201d The stated mission of Satellogic is to privatize and monopolize Earth Observation in the form of satellite surveillance sold as a service to both the public and private sectors. Palantir, a private sector intelligence firm led by PayPal founder Peter Thiel and created with CIA funds to replace a controversial DARPA mass surveillance and data-mining program, committed to a five year strategic partnership wth Satellogic. Satellogic's partnership with Palantir enables its \u201cgovernment and commercial customers\u201d, which include the CIA and J.P. Morgan, access to Satellogic\u2019s Aleph platform APIs to feed raw satellite imagery to Palantir\u2019s MetaConstellation and Edge AI. This partnership builds on a previous collaboration between Satellogic and Palantir to \u201cfield unique AI capabilities to the orbital edge,\u201d including \u201clive upgrades to the satellite\u2019s onboard AI\u201d that enables \u201can ultra-low-latency maritime use-case.\u201d Palantir and Satellogic customers, which include the Pentagon's Space Systems Command, Space Force, SpaceX, the government of India, and others, will soon have access to the Edge AI platform running on Satellogic satellites \u201cto offer customers tailored AI insights\u201d which is expected to increase Satellogic\u2019s business of \u201cdata products, streamline pipeline management, and further scale customer delivery required for weekly and daily world remaps.\u201d Palantir \u201cThe holistic capabilities of Palantir\u2019s Foundry will be instrumental in helping Satellogic realize our mission to improve life on Earth through geospatial data,\u201d commented Matthew Tirman, President of Satellogic North America. Tirman later made note that within this agreement, Satellogic will provide \u201cPalantir\u2019s US government customers\u201d with access to \u201chigh-resolution satellite imagery\u201d which will \u201cdrive analytical insights across a range of mission-oriented use cases.\u201d Other notable private-public sector partnerships of Satellogic include the Endeavor-funded SkyLoom, which in late 2021 partnered with Honeywell to \u201cproduce laser crosslinks\u201d for both commercial and military satellites, including for the Pentagon\u2019s Space Development Agency, as well as with CIA contractor Amazon Web Services, to facilitate the \u201c50 gigabytes of data per day\u201d per satellite, which \u201cbeams to Earth with the help of the Amazon.com Inc. unit\u2019s AWS Ground Station service.\u201d While it is surely a profitable venture, what Satellogic truly enables is venture capital access to high resolution data of every single square meter on Earth. Space surveillance as a service allows the operators themselves to fill up on up-to-date information of the world's industry, energy use, transportation, commodity storage, and asset consumption \u2013 information that could influence a firm's decision while playing in the private markets. It could also be used by the public-private partnership engineering global technocratic policies that seek to limit consumption, industrialization and energy use by the public and enforce them via space. Outside of this metric-driven advantage, the aforementioned transition to a universal ledger upholding and settling the majority of financial (including purely speculative) activity will require obscene amounts of data. If the private sector's so-called commodity-backed, Real World Asset tokens are to take off in any meaningful way, highly reliable satellite imagery will be needed to uphold billions of dollars of value. Any push towards smart contract-derived money representing tangible objects will demand exactly the data Satellogic intends to not only supply but sell as a service \u2013 to any firm, or government. Blockchain - The New Enabling Environment The idea of green finance, in which private firms utilize data and physical elements from the real world to create novel economic instruments such as bonds based on carbon emissions, necessitates government-upheld agreements and eventual court-based litigation as the ability to find consensus, thus acting as the enabling environment, for the settlement of large values of securities between the public and private sector. Regulation and contractual agreements between governments and their commercial sector partners require not just the literal letter of the law, but vetted insurance brokers, data firms, legislative bureaucrats, and various other accredited lawyers to dictate the grounds in which business can be legally conducted. The private-public partnership has become continually blurred by the relaxing of regulation restricting how corporations can influence current and aspiring politicians via campaign fundraising. In turn, this group of purchased public sector employees must repay the corporations responsible for their successful attempts at gaining office, leading to the push for further dissolution of certain laws that prevented their donors from gaining footholds within a once-regulated market. No longer is the public sector primarily beholden to their constituents, but rather their corporate donors. This ongoing dynamic has led to a runaway feedback of legal corruption and conspiracy between these ostensibly delineated sectors. The net result of the public-private partnerships that upholds the CC35, Green+ and Satellogic collaborations is due to the calculated focus on regional governments, thus finding their enabling environment through pacts and treaties at the subnational level. Steve Mnuchin Once larger regulatory \u201cfish are fried,\u201d the fight for further interoperability of digital assets (such as dollar instruments) moves down to the regional governments of the Global South. For example, the regulation allowing US banks to custody digital assets and stablecoins was put forth by former OneWest official and Coinbase VP Brian Brooks while he served as comptroller of the currency under Mnuchin in the Trump administration. Once world governments, local and national, are forced onboard the universal ledger, the enabling environment will trend towards the ledger itself \u2013 a product of the private sector \u2013 and further out of the hands of the public sector. This capturing of the commons by the private sector via a revolving door of public-then-private operators has been done before, such as during the Plaza Accord, the creation of Brady Bonds, the dissolution of Glass-Steagall, the demolition of Enron, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 fiscal response. The intended future of blockchain \u2013 now that US regulators have embraced Bitcoin as an asset and universal ledger \u2013 is to serve as the new enabling environment, complete with its very own digital dollar instruments, most likely backed by US government debt. There are very few people in the world more responsible for the digitization of the dollar than Steve Mnuchin and Howie Lutnick \u2013 the former's VC firm now consists of several members from his stint at the Treasury, while the latter's firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds the securities for Tether, the world's largest dollar-denominated stablecoin that recently crossed $100 billion issued \u2013 and here they are partnering with the richest man in Argentina and the founder of the largest online marketplace (as well as crypto marketplace) in Latin America, Marcos Galperin. The network of firms associated with Galperin's MercadoLibre \u2013 Xapo, Paxos, Circle, Visa, among others \u2013 is rife with board members and venture capital from the \u201cPayPal Mafia,\u201d as well as the Argentine advisor group Endeavor. These powerful organizations, successors to groups like ADELA that spurred the creation of the Club of Rome and chose the winners of Latin America\u2019s corporate landscape, have made it clear that they foresee this fundamental market transition. They have quietly positioned themselves to dominate the main pillars of the new financial system in Latin America and the world at large: regulated banking services, global marketplaces, payment processing, digital asset infrastructure, and capital creation monopolies. As we will see, this financial system is not about \u201cinclusion\u201d or \u201csustainability\u201d as professed, but about using and deepening Latin America\u2019s debt burden to force policy changes while enforcing foreign control over the region\u2019s economic activity and governance, all under the watchful \u201ceyes\u201d of US intelligence-linked satellites.

This openness to Bitcoin continued in a recent report from Franklin Templeton's Digital Assets division in which it highlighted the rise of Bitcoin-based NFTs called Ordinals, new fungible tokens, and layer 2 protocols. Franklin Templeton tweeted that these new projects primarily drive positive momentum in Bitcoin innovation. Trading volume data shows ordinals like NodeMonkes and Runestone surpassing Ethereum NFTs. According to the report, this is providing evidence that Bitcoin provides advantages over other blockchains, and that its security, decentralization, and large user base give it an edge for mainstream adoption.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. With Bitcoin\u2019s next halving set to take place this month, miners are using record profits to adapt their business models for chaotic opportunities. The halving is almost upon us. As the whole world of Bitcoin waits with bated breath for mining rewards to be cut in half, the potential for new revenue streams has left us wondering how the space will react to new market conditions. Halvings in the past have generally been associated with prosperity for Bitcoin, but they\u2019ve also been known to shake up previously-held assumptions in a big way. We\u2019re already seeing a few examples of these market changes; just to name one, the larger miners have been modernizing their equipment to ensure maximally efficient hardware. This has led to a fire sale of outdated equipment from these companies, with many thousands of mining rigs finding their way to aspiring miners in Africa and Latin America. The cheap hydroelectricity from Ethiopia has already been attracting international capital to become a new mining hub, and a large portion of these rigs are going there for pennies on the dollar. In other words, miners are expecting to see less output in the immediate future, but this has nevertheless incentivized the creation of new mining companies worldwide and net growth for the industry. This is just one illustration of the sorts of unexpected opportunities that will take the digital asset space by storm, and it\u2019s up to Bitcoiners to seize on them. For miners as a whole, opportunities are certainly plentiful. March 2024 saw the highest ever monthly revenues for the collective mining industry, just topping $2 billion. This is particularly noteworthy because less than half of this revenue has come from transaction fees, a far cry from the situation in December where transaction fees outpaced mining rewards. In December, the price of Bitcoin was far lower, and the blockchain was plagued with congestion. Not only did this congestion suppress the demand for buying Bitcoin, but it also raised the demand for miners to process the blockchain. Simply resolving transactions on already-mined Bitcoin made up a larger share of profits than mining and selling new ones, and this enterprise became a lifeline for many smaller firms. Now, however, it seems like the money is flowing all around. Bitcoin ETFs are gobbling up Bitcoin at extreme rates\u2014more than 6x the actual output of miners. The bonanza has even brought venture capital interest squarely back into focus, further increasing the frenzy. In the first three months of 2024, major exchanges collectively saw their reserves of Bitcoin drop by nearly $10 billion, revealing the immense demand for newly-mined coins. With market conditions like this, it\u2019s no wonder that miner profits have hit an all-time record. Source However, although this period of intense sales has certainly created an opportunity for the miners, there are also perils associated with the halving. These companies are in a mad dash to secure as much revenue as possible pre-halving, and the race is so desperate for one simple reason: trendlines may give encouraging data, but there\u2019s no actual guarantee that Bitcoin\u2019s price will climb accordingly after its supply is cut down. Halving hype and the runaway success of ETFs have brought Bitcoin\u2019s price to its highest levels, but this record has been followed by volatility. Bitcoin has hovered around its great benchmark ever since passing it without continuing to rally in a bombastic spike. If Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to behave in unexpected ways, it will eventually wreak havoc on smaller firms and promote industry consolidation. Additionally, a particularly interesting development has emerged in the secondary Bitcoin markets. Since the rapacious demand of ETF issuers and other financial institutions has completely outpaced supply, some long-term holders (LTHs) have been awakening to fears of a generalized liquidity crisis. Whales previously content to hold Bitcoin for years at a time have changed their behavior, evidently deciding that now is the time to finally realize massive profits. March 2024 has seen long-term holders begin selling their assets at unprecedented rates, raking in a disproportionate amount of profit in relation to other Bitcoin sellers. Obviously, a resource like this cannot last forever, but it\u2019s an important reminder to some of the miners: just because you\u2019re having trouble making ends meet post-halving, it doesn\u2019t mean the industry is. Adapt, or the space will find new ways to leave you behind. Source Nevertheless, miners big and small have not taken on the challenge of the halving lying down. These runaway profits have enabled businesses to invest in a wide variety of preparation strategies, sometimes even dramatically shaking up their business models. For example, the American firm Arkon Energy has previously operated more as an infrastructure company, viewing itself as a provider for a client base of independent miners. As it announced a major purchase of state-of-the-art mining equipment on April 2nd, it joined an industry-wide trend of preparing for the halving with maximally efficient machines. Rather than offering this equipment to its previous clientele, however, Arkon has stated its intention to pivot and simply mine Bitcoin themselves. This simple shift represents a dramatic change in their overall business model, and they plan to follow through by \u201caiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world\u201d. Leading miner Hut 8, on the other hand, has initiated a business model pivot of its own, but in a slightly different direction. A Q1 earnings call in late March saw CEO Asher Genoot acknowledge that 70% of the company\u2019s revenue came from asset mining, but that plans were expected to change somewhat as the halving approaches. Hut 8 is still focusing on upgrading its hardware and exploiting energy resources at new sites, like many other mining companies, but it\u2019s also investing in a new direction. This new direction is not in a different asset, as its mining operations are focused on Bitcoin, but rather in developing high-performance computing and AI operations. Genoot claimed that these new operations were \u201csub-scale today\u2026 But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow.\" He added that \u201cYou\u2019ll see us continuing to be creative in how we maximize the value of every machine,\u201d stressing the need to maintain an eager and disciplined attitude toward the existing mining operations. These are just a couple of the different new strategies that miners are taking to anticipate the halving. Companies have been preparing for months now, and there is still time to make additional new plans. At the time of writing, the halving is in less than three weeks, and the countdown to this event reveals the optimistic and celebratory attitude of Bitcoiners everywhere. No matter what happens when the long-awaited day finally gets here, a few constants seem very reliable. There will be an immense demand for the world\u2019s leading digital asset, and the Bitcoin community will have the same innovative spirit as always. Whether Bitcoin jumps right away or behaves unpredictably, it\u2019s certain that someone will wind up a big winner. For us Bitcoiners, that means there\u2019s plenty to look forward to.","article_summary":"Halving hype and ETF inflows have left Bitcoin miners with all-time profit margins.

GDA, which was founded in 2013 and operates 19 mining facilities across North America, Europe and Central Asia, has entered into a strategic hosting arrangement with Lonestar Dream, developer of immersion cooling systems for bitcoin mining devices, to run the Tarbush operation. \u201cThis hosting agreement is an important milestone for us as we continue expansion in the West Texas region,\u201d said Andrey Kim, CEO of GDA in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. This is the 6th new site in Texas into which GDA has expanded in recent years. The state\u2019s abundance of renewable energy and its flexible power grid have prompted the company to continue expanding in Texas. Tarbush is located within the ERCOT West Hub, which is well-suited for wind and solar energy production. As of Q1 2023, ERCOT, which stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, was the top region for renewable energy generation output across the US, according to S&P Global. And PBS recently acknowledged that Texas, a state once well known for its oil production, is quickly becoming a leader in renewable energy. According to ERCOT, renewable resources like wind and solar normally meet approximately 40% of the energy demand in Texas. During some periods, though, they can meet as much as 75% of the demand. Wind, solar, and a tiny bit of hydro met 75% of power demand in ERCOT today a little after 2:00, a new record.

That's TRIPLE the inflows from February ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/Ol1PaS8vC9 \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 3, 2024 According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, March trading volume was around triple that of February and January. The massive rise indicates spot bitcoin ETFs are meeting strong demand from institutional and retail investors. He stated, \"I can't imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.\" BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack, capturing 50% of the total volume. Grayscale's GBTC took second place with 20%, while Fidelity's FBTC followed at 17%. Balchunas declared IBIT the \"$GLD of bitcoin,\" referring to the mammoth SPDR Gold ETF. He said its March victory makes IBIT the undisputed leader among bitcoin ETFs. The surge in trading activity aligns with Bitcoin's climb to new all-time highs in March. However, it also suggests spot ETFs are altering market dynamics and driving new demand. Critics initially argued bitcoin markets would shrug off the new products. Yet flows into funds like IBIT and FBTC have been overwhelmingly positive. Demand is vastly outpacing bitcoin mined. ETFs bought around 66,000 BTC in March, while miners only produced 28,500. This supply-demand imbalance seems poised to grow as more investors get exposure through ETFs and newly mined coins get cut in half in two weeks during the bitcoin halving event. With strong inflows, assets under management, and trading activity, these new regulated instruments have firmly established themselves within Bitcoin markets. If March was any indication, their rise is only just beginning.","article_summary":"Spot bitcoin ETFs saw record trading volume of $111 billion in March, nearly triple February's total, indicating strong demand for the new products.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/111-billion-bitcoin-etfs-record-inflows-march","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-03T17:59:54Z","type":"article","category":["Business"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/111-billion-bitcoin-etfs-record-inflows-march","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU2NDEwNjkxMjY3/wall-street-blockchain-alliance-launches-educational-platform-for-financial-markets.jpg"},{"article_title":"US Government Preparing to Sell 30,000 Silk Road Bitcoin, On-Chain Data Shows","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Today, the US government sent a transaction that appears to indicate it may be on the verge of liquidating the remaining Bitcoin it confiscated from the online marketplace Silk Road. According to on-chain data, a 0.001 BTC test transaction, part of a larger stash of approximately 30,174 BTC worth $2 billion linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace, were moved by the US government. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, received the transaction from these Silk Road-related funds.

Youssef and the global team at NoOnes are on a mission to end financial apartheid and to unite the financially disenfranchised around the world. In the process, they\u2019re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: What is the primary mission of NoOnes? Ray Youssef: It's the world's first peer-to-peer distributed nation. I see myself as a chief advocate, not just CEO \u2014 someone that is representing the people. We want to onboard a billion citizens in the next six years. By citizens, I mean engaged customers. They're not just using it once every two weeks. They have to be deeply engaged for this to be victorious. That means a billion daily engaged people. It's an amazing number when you consider Binance has 120 million users and about 2-3% of them are probably monthly active. We're trying to get a hundred times that. Corva: How many people are currently using it? Youssef: We have about 400,000 active users, which is pretty amazing. My old company had like a quarter million active [users]. The goal here is not just to get empty signups. The goal here is to make people active. Corva: You\u2019ve talked about how apps like NoOnes and Bitcoin can help end \u201cfinancial apartheid.\u201d Could you define this term? Youssef: Financial apartheid is the most evil form of apartheid. It's invisible chains that have basically kept the vast majority of the world poor for over a hundred years, and people aren't even aware [of it]. It manifests in so many different ways. Broken overregulation [is one form of it]. Africa is the most overregulated region of the world. M-Pesa is the top mobile wallet in Kenya. 98.8% of Kenyans have an M-Pesa wallet. M-Pesa is so big it\u2019s expanded beyond Kenya to Ghana, South African and other African countries, but you still can't send money from an M-Pesa wallet in Kenya to an M-Pesa wallet in Ghana or South Africa. You are trapped in the economy where your passport was issued. You can't access liquidity in other countries, and they can't access liquidity in your country. The problem gets even worse when you consider commerce between companies. Pan-European trade is at 69%. In Asia, I think it\u2019s 59%. Latin America drops down to 30%. And Africa, officially it's at 13%. But guess what? The real number is less than 1%. Because in that 13%, they count all these American and Western corporations that just have local names. Intracontinental African trade is at less than 1%. If that doesn't scream financial apartheid, what does? Corva: Speaking of Africa, let's discuss what's happening in Nigeria. The government took two Binance executives hostage. In response, Binance has stopped supporting the Naira and has shut down its P2P trading platform in Nigeria. NoOnes is currently enabling Binance P2P traders to transfer their P2P trading profiles from Binance to NoOnes. How is this going? Youssef: Traders are very happy to have their feedback imported over. It's very important. Reputation is huge in this business, especially if you're an OTC trader. [So,] we made a special landing page for all the peer-to-peer refugees. They're very happy to come over and be able to talk to the CEO directly in a Telegram and WhatsApp channel. That goes a long way. Binance is being torn apart by the US government right now. Why did they go for this guy (Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance\u2019s former CEO) so hard? Were they angry he was front-running his own users? No. They didn't care about that at all. What they really cared about is that CZ and Binance allowed all of us plebs \u2014 all of us peasants out there \u2014 to have financial access through peer-to-peer trading. The fact that there's 120 million people on the same internal money transmission network and that CZ has all these off ramps to local money all over the world set them off. Remember the guy they came after before CZ? Ross. Corva: Ross Ulbricht? Youssef: Yes, sir. Peer-to-peer is the enemy, and it always has been. They've had Ross in jail for over 11 years. He just put up a website like Amazon or eBay where anyone could trade anyone with anything. [Sure,] some people sold some weed on there. For that, they made up this story about [his involvement in a murder conspiracy]. This is all garbage. This is a sweet, innocent kid. And they put him in jail for two life sentences. Corva: And Sam Bankman-Fried only got 25 years. Youssef: The only reason Sam Bankman-Fried got any time at all was because some rich people lost some money. This is the only reason that Madoff got any time at all. too. If he was robbing poor people, no one would give a damn. But Ross Ulbricht, man, they hit him with everything because they could. They wanted to send a message: \u201cHey, if you try to make global free marketplaces \u2014 real commerce \u2014 happen, we're going to destroy you. You don\u2019t touch that.\u201d And guess what? They\u2019ve done that to bitcoin, [too]. They said, \u201cHey, we\u2019ll let bitcoin exist as a store of value. If you get in good with us, we\u2019re going to give you an ETF ticker. We\u2019re going to get our pension funds in there. We\u2019re going to let the price go up high. You\u2019ll be just a little bit better off than everyone else. But you gotta give up this whole medium of exchange [thing].\u201d We gave up literally the best thing in the world, a free system of real commerce for a store of value for just another get rich quick pump and dump. It\u2019s actually beginning to dawn on all of us: Oh, my goodness. Roger Ver was right. Corva: I was actually just watching an interview with him on The Bitcoin Takeover. He made some interesting points that are in line with what you\u2019re saying. Youssef: I mean, yeah, I was pissing all over Roger with all the other clowns before, too, but the dude is right. We have lost the ethos. We have lost the foundational base for what we're doing. And should they actually manage to keep bitcoin out of the picture as this medium of exchange and just keep it as a store of value, eventually we'll lose everything. If it wasn't for what's happening in the Global South, it's empty. And quite frankly, the Global South has moved over mostly to USDT on Tron. The only nation still [using] bitcoin primarily for a medium exchange is Nigeria. But the truth is, USDT on Tron is way cheaper. It doesn't have volatility. It makes a lot more sense. So, how are we going to compete with that? Corva: That\u2019s a good question. Going back to Nigeria for a moment. NoOnes has team members on the ground who are promoting the platform in the wake of Binance P2P shutting down. Do you ever worry about their safety? How do you deal with the fact that they could easily be targeted? Youssef: Number one, I\u2019d try to get them out of the country. And if we can't do that, then I\u2019d ask them to keep as low of a profile as possible. We also keep something in the bank to represent them legally. I don't want anyone to go to jail for anything I do. I'm not going to play with other people's freedom or safety. But throughout this whole process, everyone's been pooping all over the Nigerian government. They're like, \u201cThese people are dumb,\u201d and that's not helpful. There are some very smart people in the Nigerian government that know exactly what's going on, but they can't tell their own people exactly what's going on because their own people wouldn't be able to handle it or help them. Every time I talk about this on Bloomberg or CNN Africa, I say, \u201cThe governments are not the problem. There is external pressure being applied to them that we're not aware of.\u201d And this is always the case in every one of these situations, whether it's Zimbabwe or Venezuela. I invite the government to talk anytime. Peer-to-peer is not a problem but the solution to actually correcting Nigeria's capital control imbalance. If you go to peer-to-peer traders and say, \u201cWe need you to help us get more American dollars into the government here to stabilize the price of the Naira, they're like, 'Okay, [let\u2019s] do it for Nigeria.'\u201d [However,] they're not going to lose money doing it. They want to make some money doing it. But if they have the choice between doing the right thing to help everyone across a long-term timeline and making a little bit less profit, they'll take that. Believe me, these people are not stupid. They know what's good for the country is good for them, and that should be leveraged. Corva: Speaking of people not being stupid, the team at NoOnes focuses heavily on education. How challenging is educating people on the ground? Youssef: I posted a video on my Twitter of one of our workshops. There were over a thousand people there. That's how much hunger there is for this. Seriously, Education is THE way and #noOnes is absolutely blowing up now !#Bitcoin to the first billion, self custody and p2p. pic.twitter.com/lEGaNlXGSE \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) March 27, 2024 Everyone needs bullish education. What I mean by bullish education is not the one, two, threes, or even how the blockchain works. No one really cares. It's how to make money. People want to change their lives. You can move money around the world to leverage arbitrage. You can start real simple and put up an offer to buy bitcoin cheap on NoOnes and then take it and sell it on another exchange, a local exchange, whether you're in South Africa or Malawi or wherever at 10% plus. That's what some people are doing. One guy I just talked to last week was making $2,000 a month \u2014 just buying bitcoin cheaply and selling it for 9-10% of what he bought it for. He [told me], \u201cThis is how I\u2019m paying my way through college.\u201d He spends just five hours a week doing these trades. There's another dude in South Africa, and he identified a problem. Nigerian workers want to send money back home to mama. They can't do it because they don't have a South African bank account. So he tells them, \u201cDeposit your cash into my South African bank account.\u201d He just takes that cash, buys bitcoin with it, sells that Bitcoin to someone in Nigeria on the NoOnes marketplace and says, \u201cSend a bank transfer to this guy\u2019s mother\u2019s bank account.\u201d He did two peer-to-peer transactions and turned [South African] Rand into a Nigerian bank transfer, and the people on the ground are super happy they didn't have to do it themselves. They just put money in the bank, gave him his mom's bank account number. He did all the work. He's banking and making profit. He started his own remittance corridor. He's basically Western Union for the very specific corridor of South Africa to Nigeria. Corva: These are incredible stories. When I think about NoOnes, I think about people around the world gaining access to bitcoin, not necessarily becoming entrepreneurs using the platform. It\u2019s great to hear that P2P bitcoin trading enables this. Youssef: Absolutely. We are in the middle right now of the peer-to-peer revolution. It started with the internet. We got all these mobile devices and all these startups that disrupted everything except finance. Then, we got peer-to-peer electronic cash. Now, we're fighting for the soul of it as a [medium] of exchange. Peer-to-peer marketplaces are the last step. That's what they put Ross Ulbricht in jail for. That's what they put CZ in cuffs for. They don't want someone actually finishing it, completing the peer-to-peer revolution. We're going to the mom and pops, the farmers markets, but if the money isn't peer-to-peer, none of it will stick. Once we\u2019ve gone peer-to-peer, what power do they have? Humanity is officially one once we tie that ribbon around the peer-to-peer revolution.","article_summary":"Bitcoin Magazine sits down with NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef to discuss why peer-to-peer bitcoin trading is essential for the liberation of the Global South.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/1-billion-bitcoin-p2p-traders-noones-nigeria-global-south","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-02T22:59:15Z","type":"article","category":["P2P","News","Business","Marketplace","Nigeria","NoOnes","Bitcoin Marketplace","Africa"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/1-billion-bitcoin-p2p-traders-noones-nigeria-global-south","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDU3MjU5MzQ4NjMzMDg2/noones_youssef_article_preview.jpg"},{"article_title":"Tether Grants BTCPay Server $100,000 To Continue Working On Enabling Anyone To Accept Bitcoin","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Today, stablecoin issuer Tether announced a significant award of $100,000 to the BTCPay Server Foundation that underscores Tether's strong backing for the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement, emphasizing its commitment to advancing digital payment solutions, the company stated.

One of the longest running criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not possible to make arbitrary programs to control how money is spent or locked. Bitcoin only has a very limited amount of programmability in its scripting language, and the primitives available are extremely constrained. You can check a signature, you can add a timelock to something, you can manipulate data in a few simple ways, but that\u2019s it. You can program a Bitcoin UTXO to require a signature check, a timelock verification, etc. But you cannot program it to unlock based on any arbitrary conditions. Robin\u2019s insight with BitVM was that one single primitive in the field of computing could be enforced in Bitcoin script: a NAND gate, one of the basic primitives of computing at the physical/electrical level. Every computation that is possible can be constructed out of NAND gates. Script can actually verify a NAND gate due to a neat trick using OP_BOOLAND and OP_NOT. OP_BOOLAND is an AND operation, the opposite of NAND. OP_NOT takes a binary 1 or 0 value and inverts it. This together allows you to actually enforce a single NAND operation in script directly. In combination with hashlocks, a NAND gate script can be made where each input and output field has two possible hashlocks to \u201cunlock\u201d that spending path, each one pushing a 1 or 0 to the stack to perform the NAND operation. Each script also has a path where if you can reveal both preimages to a single bit value, you can immediately claim the funds. This is so that once someone decides what to input to the NAND gate, they cannot change their mind without losing money. A massive amount of NAND gate scripts can all be compacted into a taproot tree, and once someone commits to the bit values off-chain to input to that computation, the other party can challenge them on any individual step in the computation to prove it is being executed correctly on chain. Each \u201cchallenge\u201d allows the challenged party to prove that the individual gate was computed correctly, otherwise the other party can claim the funds after a timelock. Going back and forth like this if a computation is contested, it is guaranteed that the cheating party will eventually be caught and lose funds. The limitations The main limitation of BitVM is that only the people involved in creating a BitVM contract can participate, and the roles are very limited. There is the prover, the person asserting how the computation happened off-chain, and the verifier, the person who can challenge the computation and force it to be proven on-chain if the prover does not complete the computation off-chain or tries to lie about the results. One of the reasons for designing BitVM was to establish two way pegs to sidechains or other systems. The scheme offers a very powerful primitive in that use case, the ability to actually enforce funds be given to one party or the other based on the correctness of an arbitrary computation, i.e. a validity check on whether a pegout is valid according to a sidechains rules. The problem is, only the people who hold keys to that BitVM UTXO can actually go \u201cHey, you\u2019re cheating!\u201d when someone is, and engage in the challenge protocol. This ultimately makes the system still trusted. Another limitation is that the challenge response protocol can be very long. If someone realizes the outcome of the computation is going to result in them losing money and they stop responding, the verifier has to essentially guess where the individual NAND gate is in the computation that the prover would have to lie at and reveal both preimages to a bit that would give the verifier the funds. Until that specific gate is challenged on-chain, the prover can still respond correctly to a challenge and drag it out. This can be very time consuming and inefficient. Some improvements to this design have been made since the original proposal to allow for multiple verifiers to exist in the system with the prover, to create a 1-of-n trust model where only a single verifier is required to challenge a dishonest prover. However, this requires the instantiation of multiple BitVM instances in parallel to accomplish, and therefore increases the inefficiencies with the original two party design. BitVM 2 Robin recently proposed a design scheme for BitVM 2. This scheme seeks to make a few trade offs in comparison to the original design for the benefit of mitigating its two major shortcomings. BitVM 2 shortens the challenge/response protocol length from an indeterminate series of transactions that could be upwards of dozens in the worst case scenario, to two rounds in the challenge/response. In addition to this, with the use of connector outputs it allows anyone to act as a verifier. It does not require someone to be a member involved in establishing the BitVM to challenge a dishonest prover. The fundamental shift here is moving away from directly using script NAND gates to implement the raw computational trace directly, and moving to using them to implement a general SNARK zero knowledge proof verifier (one of the core primitives Robin intended from the start to implement using BitVM). Instead of putting the raw input into the raw computational trace, and running it gate by gate in their own tapleaf scripts, the input of the BitVM 2 instance would simply be a zero knowledge proof input in combination with an asserted output of the computation. In addition to abstracting away the computation implementation with a ZKP, the tapleaf scripts are being massively expanded from a single NAND gate per leaf to an entire sub-function of the ZKP verifier. Instead of the challenge response protocol being based around the verifier guessing at which NAND gate the prover attempted to cheat at, selectively challenging at a single gate, the verifier can prove an entire sub-function\u2019s output is invalid according to the input. Just like BitVM 1, the contract is pre-negotiated using pre-signed transactions and branching scripts. Funds pegged into the BitVM are sent to an n-of-n multisig which signs two possible execution transactions, one in which no challenge occurs, and one in which a challenge occurs. To start the process of executing the contract, the prover initiates a kick off transaction. This kick off transaction commits to the output value \u2018y\u2019 they claim the computation produces, and includes three outputs: a timelocked output that is included in the no challenge execution transaction, a connector output A, and a connector output B, both of which also are spent in the no challenge transaction. Here is where the design allows for anyone to participate as a verifier. Connector output A has a second pre-signed transaction that can spend it, the challenge transaction. This is a pre-signed transaction that pays the prover a bond in bitcoin, but the connector output A is not enough to fund it. Literally anyone can add their own inputs to fund the transaction and spend connector output A, which invalidates the no challenge withdrawal transaction for the prover (one of the inputs it needs no challenge exists). This forces the challenge path. Connector output B is also spendable using a pre-signed transaction, the assert transaction, to the output of every sub-function in the entire BitVM 2 contract. This requires a large transaction with a lot of data, but remember, the ultimate output \u2018y\u2019 the prover is claiming the computation produced was already committed to in the kick off transaction. This creates two outputs. One is a timelocked output, the other is a connector output C. Both of these outputs, in addition to the original pegged in funds, are all spent in the second successful withdrawal transaction for the prover after the timelock. Connector output C is also spendable by anyone who can prove that any sub-function output in the BitVM 2 contract produces an invalid output. This requires a very large transaction, because the script necessary to prove an entire section of the BitVM computation is incorrect is massive, but in this single transaction a verifier can claim the coins in the connector output with a valid proof. This invalidates the second withdrawal transaction for the prover and effectively burns the coins. The only way to recover them at this point is if the prover and all of the verifiers in the original n-of-n funding multisig all cooperate to recover them (in the case of a setup ceremony involving key deletion this recovery possibility does not exist). Connector output B in the kick off transaction can also be spent after a much longer timeout than no challenge withdrawal to invalidate both the no challenge and the assert transaction, burning the pegged coins. This reduces what could be a ridiculous chain of transactions in the original BitVM proposal to enforce the correct contract outcome, to at most four transactions (although admittedly very massive ones), while in the process making the set of verifiers for the BitVM 2 instance literally anyone with bitcoin who will fund the challenge transaction. BitVM 2 could wind up being a significant breakthrough in regards to the wave of rollups and other layer 2s aiming to use BitVM as a two way peg. The operator of a rollup (the prover in the BitVM) can use their own funds to cover withdrawals of users who have pegged into the system, and periodically withdraw those funds from the BitVM to compensate themselves. Any user or interested party would then be able to penalize them by burning their funds if they could produce proof the operator was not processing all withdrawals correctly. It is important to note that ultimately the security of a BitVM 2 instance is backstopped by the n-of-n keyholder, even though people not participating in it can still challenge the prover as a verifier. But because the prover has an efficient exit in the case of no challengers, and anyone can fund the challenge transaction to act as a verifier, the n-of-n funding multisig could follow a setup and key deletion ceremony similar to the Zcash launch to improve its security. BitVM 2 will probably wind up being a significant breakthrough in terms of improving the flexibility and trust model of two way pegs that make use of BitVM. Once again, Robin has proven himself a real wizard.","article_summary":"Robin Linus has recently released a proposal for BitVM 2, offering significant improvements from the original BitVM proposal.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-02T21:00:00Z","type":"article","category":["Robin Linus","BitVM","BitVM 2","Technical","Opinion"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NjA0Nzk5MDIyNTkw/default_a_close_up_view_of_the_glowing_lines_of_electricity_su_0.jpg"},{"article_title":"Arkon Energy Orders 27,700 New-Generation Bitcoin Mining Machines from Bitmain","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC, a leading player in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, has placed a significant order with Bitmain Development Pte.

Halving coming in hot in 2 weeks üôå \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 2, 2024 Of the $2 billion earned last month, around $85 million came from transaction fees, while $1.93 billion was from the block subsidy. (Miners receive compensation both for validating transactions and minting new bitcoins.) The block subsidy, paid out for each block mined, is currently 6.25 bitcoins. But it will drop to 3.125 bitcoins after the upcoming halving event in April. This will cut miner revenue from new bitcoin creation in half unless there is a significant price rise. Higher network activity and increasing bitcoin prices both contributed to miners' bumper revenues in March. The upcoming halving created urgency for miners to maximize earnings before profits are squeezed. The leading US mining pool, Foundry, captured 29.4% of all blocks mined in March. Chinese pool AntPool took second place with 22.4% of blocks. The two captured over half the monthly Bitcoin supply. While miners enjoyed their profit bonanza last month, exchange-traded funds purchasing bitcoins on the open market accumulated even more. ETFs bought roughly 66,000 bitcoins in March, while miners only produced around 25,500. This widening supply-demand imbalance and halving-related scarcity could spur greater competition to secure Bitcoin. The resulting difficulty increases may start pricing out less efficient miners, spurring industry consolidation. With the halving cutting rewards in half in a matter of weeks, miners face an increasingly harsh environment if Bitcoin's price fails to compensate for the drop in issuance. But if history repeats, a strong bitcoin bull run could still be on the horizon, softening the revenue blow of reduced block subsidies.","article_summary":"Bitcoin miners generated a record $2 billion in monthly revenue in March between block rewards and fees, setting a new high ahead of the upcoming halving event.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 15 07:12:57 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713139977},"creation_date":"2024-04-02T18:58:30Z","type":"article","category":["Business"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5NTIzMTk3NTA5NDQ1MjQ4/what-is-bitcoin-mining.png"},{"article_title":"Tether Adds 8,888 BTC Worth $600 Million to Bitcoin Treasury, On-Chain Data Shows","author":"Vivek Sen","article_detailed_content":"Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million.

On day one, $4.6B in shares were traded, with cumulative trading volume exceeding the $50B mark by February 22. The ETF approval in the U.S. is expected to have a far-reaching impact across Asian markets where investment flows are already significant, especially in institutional investing, and picking up pace. The question on the minds of observers, investors, and industry participants is: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d By taking stock of what has happened in the US and as we look East, we can better understand what to expect in markets like Hong Kong and other countries in the region. Spotlight on Hong Kong Optimism for approval exists about a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong. In January, they accepted the first application from one of China\u2019s major asset funds, Harvest Fund Management. Although hopes existed for approval as early as Q1 2024, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see it take until at least Q2. Approvals of traditional ETFs by Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) typically take weeks to months. Given that Hong Kong has already approved a few crypto ETF futures funds\u2014including the CSOP Bitcoin Futures, CSOP Ether Futures, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures\u2014one can reasonably hope that the path to a spot ETF approval will come with time. On the face of it, giving those approvals would make sense all around. Hong Kong serves as a conduit to China\u2019s wealth and has established a regulatory environment to go alongside the depth of its asset and wealth management sector. Plus, because Hong Kong already offers Ethereum futures, they may be more open to spot Ethereum ETFs. In comparison to the U.S., the SEC has received applications for spot Ethereum ETFs with a response required by May 23, although it was allowable earlier; on February 7, the SEC issued a delay statement. Assessing the Likelihood of Approval From Other Asian Countries The only major countries in the APAC region in which spot Bitcoin ETFs are not in any stage of development seem to be China, Thailand, and Singapore. Major Asian countries that will likely follow in the general pathway of the U.S. and Hong Kong include Japan, South Korea, and Australia; although these are relatively early days, people are already expressing interest in these products. Regulations in each country are somewhat different, and so the paths towards crypto product approvals will also differ. South Korea The country\u2019s Virtual Asset User Protection Act is set to go into effect in July 2024. This gives South Korea\u2019s Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea the authority to oversee crypto exchanges and custodians. Although news stories have provided conflicting information about the likelihood of spot Bitcoin approvals, two key factors point to optimism. First, politicians running for election are more open to the idea. Next, Governor Lee Bok-hyun of the Financial Supervisory Service is set to meet with the U.S. SEC\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler, in May to discuss spot Bitcoin ETFs. At minimum, this shows South Korea\u2019s openness to the financial product. Japan Encouraging signs also exist in Japan. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, the country\u2019s cabinet approved a bill that permits the nation\u2019s investment funds and venture capital companies to acquire crypto. If passed by Parliament, then this will become law. Plus, some of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions, as part of a consortium of more than seventy Japanese companies, are expected to launch a yen-backed digital currency in July 2024 privately. This comes alongside Japan\u2019s government pension fund recently mentioning that it is requesting information on \u201cilliquidity assets,\u201d such as bitcoin, as part of research into potential new investments. Although neither of these actions would directly allow a spot Bitcoin ETF, they both will play a role in creating a more crypto-friendly environment. Australia Australia\u2019s enthusiasm for Bitcoin has \u201cdemonstrably shifted\u201d after the SEC approval. Across demographics, positive Bitcoin sentiment increased by 25 percent while, specifically looking at people aged fifty-five and up, the news boosted Bitcoin favorability by 100 percent. Plus, this enthusiasm already has an outlet with many people in Australia able to invest in the U.S. ETFs, with predictions suggesting that the Australian Securities Exchange will soon make similar products available. It\u2019s already highly anticipated that Monochrome Asset Management, located in Brisbane, Australia, will launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in H1 2024, with the U.S. approval possibility speeding up the approval. What\u2019s Stopping More Regulatory-Approved Crypto Businesses? As countries create regulations and structures for crypto products worldwide, two key topics regularly arise the need for anti-money laundering (AML) rules and counter-terrorism financing (CTF). This may be especially important in Asia, where the threat of money laundering and terrorist funding is significant, Hong Kong and Singapore, for example, have strict requirements for exchanges that want to receive a crypto license. Then, transactions are stringently monitored with know your customers (KYC) procedures diligently followed. Because these are key financial centers, tripping up can have costly effects, including on the reputations of the firms that skip steps or otherwise don\u2019t conform. In South Korea, all registered and licensed exchanges need to have a banking partner because of money laundering concerns and the related terrorist financing of North Korea. When opening a crypto account in that Asian country, banking details and KYC data are linked to the crypto exchange account for transparent fund flows to satisfy regulator concerns. For spot Bitcoin ETF approval, questions about market manipulation\u2014a concern listed by Gensler when delaying U.S. approval\u2014will also need to be addressed to the satisfaction of Asian regulators. Visibility is also important to allow regulators and investors to feel confident, which will help crypto products become a bigger part of the financial pie. These structures and guardrails can allay concerns and lay the foundation for further growth. Plus, safe, secure custody for crypto products must be firmly in place in Asia and worldwide. Optimism exists for all of this foundational work to occur in ways that allow Asian countries to participate in the in-demand crypto products like spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs in ways that satisfy AML, CTF, and market manipulation concerns with safe and secure custody provided.

The company installed and activated over 5,000 T21 miners at two facilities in Qu√©bec, Canada. Bitfarms installed 3,168 T21s devices at its Garlock, Qu√©bec facility, plus 1,710 T21s and 100 M53S+ hydro miners at its Farnham, Qu√©bec site. The latest upgrades improve energy efficiency by about 51%. Geoff Morphy, President and CEO of Bitfarms, emphasized the benefit of efficiency, asserting the \u201ctransformative nature of [the] upgrade plan.\u201d He noted that greater efficiency prepares the company for Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event. Bitfarms intends to deploy another 30,000 miners this quarter. The company will introduce these upgrades in existing locations, including its new Paso Pe, Paraguay facility. The 30,000 deployments will help the company approach its 2024 targets of 12 EH/s and 21 EH/s. Halving is fast approaching Bitfarms is just one of many companies expanding ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event, which is expected to occur on April 19. CleanSpark announced on April 12 that it expanded its hash rate to 17 EH/s. CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford said the company is \u201cwell-suited\u201d for the halving, both because of its own efficiency and because competitors\u2019 old, inefficient machines will leave the network. Marathon said in a Bloomberg interview in March that it plans to expand in light of the halving. Hut 8 said in February that the halving would provide opportunities for future growth and announced plans to construct a new Texas facility. Cipher Mining and Stronghold Digital Mining also announced expansions in January. The halving will reduce mining rewards per block. Not accounting for possible fluctuations in BTC prices, lower rewards will likely reduce profitability for some mining companies. However, lower profits can potentially be offset by more efficient operations.

Ficco said the IRS has seen an increase in \u201cpure crypto tax crimes\u201d that fall under Title 26 of the US Code, which includes federal income tax violations. Crimes considered pure tax crimes involve failing to report income from crypto sales and hiding or shielding one\u2019s actual basis in crypto. The issue will likely persist. Ficco observed an \u201cuptick\u201d in tax-reporting crimes and expects the IRS to bring forward more charges this year and in the future. Until recently, IRS investigations have primarily been a part of broader investigations into crypto crimes such as scams and embezzlement. Ficco acknowledged that crypto is \u201cbecoming more pervasive\u201d and will \u201cmaintain or probably have a larger part\u201d in broader crimes such as phone scams, romance scams, and pig butchering. Crypto scams are distinct from tax-reporting crimes. Reporting failures widespread Ficco\u2019s comments come after the IRS published a reminder that individuals must report taxes if they sold crypto, received crypto as payment, or engaged in other crypto transactions. The IRS has included some form of tax reporting rules for crypto investors since at least 2014, but past reports suggest that reporting failures remain high. A 2023 report from Divly found that in the US, just 1.62% of investors paid taxes on crypto as required. The US rate is only slightly above the global average of 0.53%. IRS enforcement efforts around crypto could become especially strong starting this year. In February, the agency hired two experts to focus on crypto, and past reports from CNBC suggest that tax professionals are preparing for a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of scrutiny. Ficco\u2019s predecessor, Jim Lee, also suggested an increased focus on tax issues in December 2023. Lee said half of 2023\u2019s then-active crypto investigations involved tax issues.

JP Morgan and Bitcoin investment management firm NYDIG anticipated that spot Bitcoin ETFs could achieve an AUM of $36 billion and $30 billion by the year\u2019s end. Meanwhile, Matrixport predicted the ETF would garner an AUM between $24 billion and $50 billion by Dec. 31, 2024. The actual AUM is nearly twice as high as each company\u2019s earlier prediction, and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the way to meet the more optimistic predictions made by CryptoQuant, Standard Chartered, and Bloomberg Intelligence. Bloomberg and Standard Chartered project an end-of-year AUM of roughly $100 billion for the ETFs, while CryptoQuant believes they will reach $150 billion. The data includes Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, which accounts for $22.26 billion of the collective AUM and has mostly seen outflows since its launch. Other key ETF data Bitwise\u2019s report also revealed that spot Bitcoin ETF demand far exceeded new BTC production during the first quarter of 2024. Miners produced 74,756 BTC during the first quarter, while the ETFs collectively took in 212,852 BTC \u2014 2.8x higher than the amount produced. The report said that the reduction in mining output caused by Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving \u2014 expected roughly around April 20 \u2014 could affect the supply-demand ratio. Bitcoin ETFs also demonstrated strong performance against the two largest US gold ETFs. During the first quarter, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $12 billion in inflows against $3 billion in gold ETF outflows. Despite their broader success, Bitcoin ETFs represent only a minority of Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin ETFs hold 800,000 BTC, amounting to 3.9% of all Bitcoin ownership. Individuals (57%), inactive accounts (17.6%), and several other small categories hold the remainder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin findings The Bitwise report also noted that Bitcoin had demonstrated high performance year-to-date, with its value rising 66.99% year-to-date \u2014 outperforming growth in almost every market, including the US equities (10.56%), gold (8.09%), DM equities (5.81%), and other markets. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan also noted \u201clow correlations between Bitcoin and the S&P 500,\u201d represented in the report by a 0.11 correlation between Bitcoin and the US equities market. The correlation is critical, as the degree to which Bitcoin correlates with traditional markets determines whether Bitcoin is a risk-on asset or a hedge against conventional markets. Hougan said Bitwise\u2019s report should provoke a \u201cstaggeringly bullish\u201d attitude toward the crypto market. He noted crypto has been in the bull market phase for the past 1.25 years and that bull markets typically last three years, meaning strong performance may persist.

The DOJ said Ahmed manipulated pricing data on the unnamed platform to siphon approximately $9 million in inflated fees and withdrew the funds in crypto. Subsequently, Ahmed agreed to return around $7.5 million under the condition that the exchange refrains from involving law enforcement.

Anza, a spinoff of Solana Labs, spearheaded the development with the release of version 1.18.11 aimed at mitigating network congestion. Validator clients, essential in proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana, verify transactions to ensure compliance with network rules and confirm the sender\u2019s fund sufficiency before appending new blocks to the blockchain. Recently, spam transactions have significantly slowed processing times and increased transaction drop rates on Solana, which uniquely processes transactions directly without a mempool, adding complexity to its congestion issues. Anza initially deployed the updated software version 1.18.11 on a devnet, and they are now calling for testnet validators to test the effectiveness of these fixes. Anza tweeted on April 12: \u201cThe v1.18.11 release is now deployed to devnet, recommended for use on testnet. Please upgrade ASAP to help us start analyzing the effects of the proposed congestion fixes.\u201d In response to the congestion, Solana developers are also exploring strategies to enhance network efficiency. These include optimizing computing unit usage, implementing priority fees to improve user experiences, and developing a stake-weighted Quality-of-Service (QoS) system to prioritize transactions more efficiently. External analyses have highlighted the negative impact of congestion on Solana\u2019s operational performance. The network serves as a significant hub for DeFi activities, which has escalated the congestion problem with increased demand, leading to record-high trading volumes on decentralized exchanges in March. Austin Federa, Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, recently addressed the root causes of these issues in a tweet: \u201cThe issues stem from an implementation of the QUIC protocol and can be attributed to a known issue that suddenly got much worse due to unprecedented demand.\u201d Teams from Anza, Firedancer, Jito, and other core contributors are actively working to strengthen Solana\u2019s networking stack in response to this demand. Federa remains optimistic about overcoming these challenges, drawing parallels to similar obstacles the network faced in early 2022.

Tim Beiko, the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s protocol support lead, confirmed the development, revealing that the developers have agreed to include Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) 3074 in the network\u2019s slated overhaul. EIP 3074 EIP 3074 is a pivotal advancement within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and was introduced by Lightclients in 2020. The proposal has garnered widespread support from the crypto community as it aims to enhance the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets. Fundamentally, EIP 3074 enables conventional crypto wallets like MetaMask to function akin to smart contracts. This upgrade facilitates various functionalities, including transaction bundling, streamlining the signing process to a single step, and sponsored transactions. The latter feature empowers wallets to delegate funds for others to utilize, offering a more versatile and efficient transaction framework. Trading a new token on a DEX such as Uniswap will now only require one signature from a user\u2019s wallet as opposed to having to approve the new token and then sign the transaction to purchase. Crypto community reacts The announcement of the impending upgrade has sparked various reactions within the crypto community. Georgios Konstantopoulous, Paradigm\u2019s CTO, highlighted the update\u2019s potential to enhance wallet usability tenfold, noting Reth\u2019s successful implementation and testing. Echoing this sentiment, Hayden Adams, the mind behind Uniswap, lauded the upgrade as a significant boost to Ethereum\u2019s user experience. He added: \u201cIndustry should make an effort to create compatibility for 4337 wallets to interact with 3074 contracts (much like eip1271 has created compatibility between safes and EOAs today).\u201d However, EVM developer Alex Watts cautioned against solely focusing on user experience improvements, emphasizing the broader implications for application and mechanism design. Despite the optimism, concerns linger among some community members regarding the EIP 3074 upgrade. Ansgar Dietrich, an Ethereum Researcher involved in the proposal\u2019s inception, expressed ambivalence, reflecting on the lengthy journey to its impending mainnet integration and questioning its alignment with the evolving account abstraction roadmap. Similarly, 0xngmi, the pseudonymous developer of DeFiLlama, raised apprehensions about the upgrade potentially enabling the complete depletion of addresses, encompassing tokens, NFTs, and other DeFi assets.

Analyst Predicts \u2018Realistic\u2019 5x Surge To $3","author":"Christian Encila","article_detailed_content":"XRP, the native token of Ripple, has caught the attention of market analyst Mikybull who is calling for a potential 5x surge in the mid-term. This bullish prediction comes amidst recent struggles for XRP, which is currently grappling to maintain support above the $0.60 level. Mikybull bases his optimism on two key technical indicators: the two-year moving average (MA) and a symmetrical triangle formation on the two-month chart. XRP recently crossed above the two-year MA, a historical signifier of significant price increases according to the analyst. This pattern held true in late 2017 when XRP skyrocketed to its all-time high of $3.31 after a similar crossover. XRP Technical Chart Hints At Breakout The symmetrical triangle on the two-month chart further bolsters Mikybull\u2019s prediction. This pattern often precedes a breakout, and in XRP\u2019s case, a breakout above the triangle\u2019s upper trendline could propel the price towards $3.10, aligning with Mikybull\u2019s 5x surge target.

Nervos Network, along with its native token CKB, has not only recorded significant gains but has also climbed to the 79th rank in the market, raising questions about the factors behind its surge. Nervos Network Decoded Nervos Network is a proof-of-work (PoW) Layer 1 (L1) blockchain designed to optimize application-specific Layer 2 chains. The network aims to establish its native asset, CKB, as a more sustainable store of value (SoV) compared to Bitcoin (BTC) while providing a more secure smart contract platform than Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply and decreasing block rewards raise concerns about long-term economic incentives for miners. Notably, the Nervos Network tackles this issue by introducing a fixed annual secondary issuance of CKBs and the base supply, providing long-term incentives for miners. Nervos Network also addresses the potential security risk associated with Ethereum. In Ethereum, the value of its native asset, ETH, is not directly linked to the value of Layer 2 apps built on top of it. Nervos Network aims to mitigate this risk by ensuring that CKB is used for transaction fees and storage, creating a stronger economic relationship between the native asset and the overall network. How Secondary Issuance And State Rent Drive Sustainability Nervos utilizes a perpetual secondary issuance model to increase CKB\u2019s SoV properties. This model incentivizes users to continuously lock up CKB in proportion to the size of their applications. Furthermore, locked CKBs are subject to \u201cstate rent\u201d through inflation, which automates state rent payments and ensures a sustainable economic model. Nervos Network introduces a secondary market for chain space, enabling apps to unlock and sell CKBs without requiring relevant storage. Investors can offset inflation by purchasing CKBs and depositing them into NervosDAO, a mechanism that receives a portion of the secondary issuance to counterbalance inflation. Interestingly, this resembles \u201ctreasury bonds\u201d and offers potential investment opportunities. Approaching ATH Amidst Bitcoin Integration Announcement Having delved into the fundamentals, CKB has recently experienced a significant surge in value, breaking out of a long consolidation phase that lasted almost two years. After trading in a range of $0.0024 to $0.0035, the cryptocurrency has broken through this price level since January 30th and has seen significant gains over the past few months. Currently trading at $0.032, CKB is close to its all-time high (ATH) of $0.043, which was reached in March 2021. The token has seen notable price increases of 47%, 69%, 75%, and 14% over the past fourteen days, seven days, and 24 hours, respectively. According to CoinGecko data, CKB has also seen a significant increase in trading volume, reaching $207 million in the last 24 hours, 9.7% from the previous day\u2019s trading. In addition, CKB\u2019s market capitalization has increased significantly, nearly doubling from $740 million on April 2 to approximately $1.35 billion in just over a week. The price spike can be attributed to the announcement that Nervos Network\u2019s CKB token will join the Bitcoin network. The token\u2019s introduction of smart contract functionality, along with its interoperability and modularity features scheduled for 2024, has created excitement among investors. As Bitcoin approaches the Halving that has historically increased its value, Nervos Network is well-positioned to benefit from its strong ties to the largest cryptocurrency in the market. With its continued bullish momentum and the predicted increase in BTC\u2019s price, CKB may be poised to reach new all-time highs soon.

Analyst Thinks So","author":"Keshav Verma","article_detailed_content":"An analyst has explained how a PEPE daily close outside of a certain price range could lead its value to go on a rally of 54%. PEPE Symmetrical Triangle May Hint At The Next Move For The Memecoin In a new article on X, analyst Ali discussed the recent trend forming in the PEPE price. According to the analyst, the memecoin is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on its one-day chart. The \u201csymmetrical triangle\u201d here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle. In this pattern, there are two lines of interest between which the asset\u2019s price consolidates for a period. The upper line connects successive tops, while the lower one joins together bottoms. The main feature of the pattern is that these two lines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope (hence the \u201csymmetrical\u201d in the name). There are other triangle patterns in TA, but those have either differently angled lines (as is the case with wedges) or one line parallel to the time-axis (ascending and descending triangles). Like other TA patterns that represent a consolidation phase, the lines of the symmetrical triangle also serve as a point of potential reversal for the price. The upper line usually offers resistance (meaning tops can occur), while the lower line may provide support (bottom formation). When a break takes place from either of these lines, the price may likely see sustained momentum in that direction. This implies that a break above the triangle could be a bullish signal, while one below may be bearish. The symmetrical triangle may be viewed as a phase of the market in which the bulls and bears are at a standstill, hence why the price is ranging sideways. During a break, one of these wins out, and price action follows in that direction. Naturally, as the lines converge towards a center point in this pattern, a breakout becomes increasingly probable the closer to the apex of the triangle the asset\u2019s price gets. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that highlights the symmetrical triangle pattern that PEPE has been trading inside recently: As is visible in the graph, the 1-day price of PEPE has been approaching the triangle\u2019s apex recently, implying that a break in a direction may be coming for the memecoin. \u201cWatch out for a daily close outside of the $0.00000793 \u2013 $0.00000664 range, which could lead to a 54% move for PEPE,\u201d explains the analyst.

Analytics Platform Reveals What You Should Expect","author":"Scott Matherson","article_detailed_content":"Hannah Phung, a lead analyst at on-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain, recently gave her opinion on the impact that Bitcoin Halving could have on the flaghsip crypto\u2019s price. This adds to the ongoing debate on whether or not the Halving event could cause Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise to $100,000. Bitcoin\u2019s Price Surge Might Not Come Immediately Phung mentioned during an interview with BeInCrypto that Bitcoin\u2019s price tends to increase around 6 to 12 months after the Halving and not immediately. This is evident from the past Halving events, as Bitcoin\u2019s significant price gains came about one year after the Halving had occurred. After the first Halving on November 28, 2021, Bitcoin saw a price increase of over 8,000% one year after the event. Meanwhile, BTC saw a price increase of 284% and 559% one year after the second and third Halving events, which took place on July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020, respectively. Phung further noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price gains come from the reduction in Bitcoin miners\u2019 supply, which helps increase scarcity and drive up its price, especially when demand is stable. In February, NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin\u2019s demand was far outpacing the miners\u2019 supply. This led to several crypto analysts making bullish predictions that Bitcoin\u2019s price could increase exponentially when miners\u2019 rewards are further cut in half later this month. One such analyst was MacronautBTC, who raised the possibility of Bitcoin rising to $237,000. This Bitcoin Halving Could Be Different Despite the crypto market being known to follow historical patterns, Phung emphasized that the market can also be unpredictable, opening the possibility of this Halving being different from past ones.

This adds to the ongoing debate on whether or not the Halving event could cause Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise to $100,000. Bitcoin\u2019s Price Surge Might Not Come Immediately Phung mentioned during an interview with BeInCrypto that Bitcoin\u2019s price tends to increase around 6 to 12 months after the Halving and not immediately. This is evident from the past Halving events, as Bitcoin\u2019s significant price gains came about one year after the Halving had occurred. After the first Halving on November 28, 2021, Bitcoin saw a price increase of over 8,000% one year after the event.

Phung further noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price gains come from the reduction in Bitcoin miners\u2019 supply, which helps increase scarcity and drive up its price, especially when demand is stable. In February, NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin\u2019s demand was far outpacing the miners\u2019 supply. This led to several crypto analysts making bullish predictions that Bitcoin\u2019s price could increase exponentially when miners\u2019 rewards are further cut in half later this month. One such analyst was MacronautBTC, who raised the possibility of Bitcoin rising to $237,000. This Bitcoin Halving Could Be Different Despite the crypto market being known to follow historical patterns, Phung emphasized that the market can also be unpredictable, opening the possibility of this Halving being different from past ones. Moreover, this cycle has already proven different, considering that for the first time, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving. Furthermore, the analyst acknowledged that the Bitcoin market is \u201cmuch larger and more established compared to earlier halvings.\u201d However, Phung still expects a price increase after the halving, although she admitted that the exact timing is uncertain, meaning it could be earlier or even later than usual.

At the same time, Shiba Inu has now crossed a major milestone in the number of addresses, which could mean an increase in the number of holders. Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Drops The price of Shiba Inu can easily be moved by selling and buying pressure from investors. Recent on-chain data, however, indicates that the selling pressure is currently decreasing, which could manifest in the price of the SHIB in the coming week. Particularly, IntoTheBlock\u2019s historical active address by profitability shows the yearly average now shifting towards wallet addresses at the money.

This cohort of traders, who would normally be selling after reaching profits on their holdings, have failed to conduct a tangible number of transactions. Interestingly, this indicates they might be opting to hold right now in order to increase their unrealized profits. Similarly, on-chain data shows a substantial amount of SHIB moving out of the hands of short-term holders, contributing to a drop in selling pressure. About 4% of the entire circulating supply of SHIB has moved from short-term holders to mid-term holders in the past week. Mid-term holders hold their assets for more than a month to a year, in contrast to short-term holders, who are known for holding for less than a month before selling. What\u2019s Next For SHIB? With decreasing sell pressure and a shift to longer holding times, SHIB is poised for a reversal and continued upward momentum.

Here are the coins above it. Dogecoin Has Been Surpassed In Trader Count By Other Memecoins According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOG and DEGEN are the two assets that have managed to surpass the original meme-based cryptocurrency in terms of weekly trader count. A \u201ctrader\u201d here refers to an investor who has been holding onto their coins since less than 30 days ago. These investors generally tend to move their coins often, as they play the role of active traders in the market. They are certainly not the HODLers of the sector. When the number of these traders goes up for any asset, it means that some fresh interest is potentially coming into the coin. Price actions like rallies are only sustainable when they have an ever-increasing fuel coming in, so the trader count going up can perhaps be a bullish indication in this direction. On the other hand, the metric going down implies traders either are losing interest in the cryptocurrency or have decided to hold onto it in the long term, thus maturing past the 30-day threshold. Whatever the case be, though, a drawdown in the indicator does suggest a lack of new hands coming into the market.

Here are the coins above it. Dogecoin Has Been Surpassed In Trader Count By Other Memecoins According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOG and DEGEN are the two assets that have managed to surpass the original meme-based cryptocurrency in terms of weekly trader count. A \u201ctrader\u201d here refers to an investor who has been holding onto their coins since less than 30 days ago. These investors generally tend to move their coins often, as they play the role of active traders in the market. They are certainly not the HODLers of the sector.

Price actions like rallies are only sustainable when they have an ever-increasing fuel coming in, so the trader count going up can perhaps be a bullish indication in this direction. On the other hand, the metric going down implies traders either are losing interest in the cryptocurrency or have decided to hold onto it in the long term, thus maturing past the 30-day threshold. Whatever the case be, though, a drawdown in the indicator does suggest a lack of new hands coming into the market.

Ripple just unlocked a massive amount of tokens from escrow, which could threaten the price further. Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP In the early hours of Friday, on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert posted two transactions carrying a notable number of XRP tokens. The first transaction saw 200 million tokens unlocked from the escrow wallet, worth $122.63 million at the time of the transfer.

This second tranche of tokens, being larger than the first, was worth $183.89 million at the time, bringing the total number of unlocked tokens to 500 million. Together, both transactions were worth over $300 million. These unlocks have, unsurprisingly, stirred concern in the Ripple community for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that Ripple never does unlocks in the middle of the month. Rather, they do scheduled unlocks at the start of each month. So, these transactions have drawn the attention of the crypto community. Another cause for concern is the fact that Ripple could be selling these XRP tokens.

Due to the recent momentum, crypto enthusiasts are becoming less pessimistic about the digital asset\u2019s growth prior to the halving event. With the fast approaching much-anticipated Bitcoin Halving, Rekt Capital, a well-recognized cryptocurrency analyst and aficionado, has offered his market insights mapping out three distinct stages of the event for investors. 3 Distinct Aspects Of The Bitcoin Halving Rekt Capital\u2019s analysis delves into Bitcoin\u2018s movement before and after the halving takes place, which is expected to happen this month. In the seven days leading up to the occurrence, the crypto analyst underscored three stages to observe for a successful outcome. These three phases include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation phase, and the parabolic uptrend phase. Emphasizing on the first aspect, Rekt Capital noted that the pre-halving retrace is documented in the books and has already manifested. During this period, Bitcoin experienced an 18% pullback compared to 2016 and 2020\u2019s retracement of 38% and 19%, respectively. The expert believes that the concluded pre-halving Retrace was the last chance to purchase a deal during the pre-halving phase. Following the conclusion of the retrace, Rekt Capital has confirmed the development has laid the groundwork for the Re-accumulation range. It is important to note that the aforementioned range occurs a few weeks ahead of the halving, and it ends with a breakout from it a few weeks later. Specifically, the period could last for several weeks and up to 150 days or five months. Given the manifestation of the range, sideways movement through the halving and beyond is the major purpose of BTC. Thus, the analyst has stressed the need to be patient around this phase, as many investors get frustrated, bored, and disappointed here because their Bitcoin investments lack significant returns. As a result, they lose confidence and get shaken out of the market before the event. BTC\u2019s Post-Halving Rally Might Mirror Previous Trend As for the parabolic uptrend, Rekt Capital claims the phase will begin when Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation range. He further stated that the price of BTC tends to grow more quickly and enters a parabolic upsurge during this stage. According to the expert, this area has typically lasted about a year or a little more, particularly around 385 days in the past. However, with the possible accelerated cycle that is currently in development, the period could be halved within this bull market cycle. Rekt Capital\u2019s key perspectives came amidst Bitcoin demonstrating strength to revisit its current all-time high of $73,000. BTC has managed to amass gains of more than 6% in the past few days. It recovered to the $70,000 level after plunging as low as $67,000 on Wednesday and is getting close to $71,000. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $70,854, indicating over 6% increase in the past week. Its market capitalization is up by 1% and its trading volume has plummeted by more than 21% over the past day. Given the current trend in the coin market, BTC could be in a position to see even bigger gains in the months to come.","article_summary":"Bitcoin is now hovering around the $70,000 threshold after a notable recovery it witnessed a few days ago.

This history-making agreement marks UFC\u2019s first-ever top-level blockchain partnership, while VeChain gains a powerful platform to reach fight fans around the world. UFC Flexes Financial Muscle This strategic alliance injects a significant revenue boost for UFC, exceeding their previous sponsorship records according to UFC\u2019s senior vice president of global partnerships, Paul Asencio. The deal also positions the MMA giant at the forefront of a burgeoning trend, as the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry continues its meteoric rise. VeChain Poised For Global Exposure For VeChain, the partnership presents a golden opportunity. Their brand will be thrust into the global spotlight, reaching an estimated 900 million television households across 175 countries. This unprecedented exposure will be amplified through prominent placement within UFC events, including branding on the iconic Octagon canvas and digital displays. The blockchain firm will also co-create content with UFC for their digital platforms, further solidifying their presence in the combat sports landscape. A Deeper Dive Into The Partnership This partnership goes beyond simple logo placements. VeChain\u2019s branding will be woven into the very fabric of UFC events. The \u201cofficial blockchain partner\u201d will see their logo displayed prominently within the Octagon, the center stage for all UFC fights. This constant visual reminder will serve as a powerful marketing tool for VeChain, keeping their name at the forefront of fight fans\u2019 minds. The partnership extends beyond branding and content creation. An annual \u201cBrand Ambassador Fund\u201d will offer paid opportunities for UFC athletes to participate in VeChain marketing initiatives. This innovative approach leverages the immense popularity of UFC fighters to further amplify the company\u2019s reach and connect with a passionate fanbase. Not UFC\u2019s First Crypto Dance This isn\u2019t UFC\u2019s first foray into the world of cryptocurrency. They previously partnered with Crypto.com, a leading crypto exchange, which resulted in fan bonuses being awarded in Bitcoin. Additionally, UFC collaborated with NFT creator Dapper Labs to release a series of officially licensed non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These ventures demonstrate UFC\u2019s willingness to embrace innovative technologies and explore new revenue streams within the ever-evolving financial landscape. The partnership signifies a pivotal moment in the convergence of professional sports and blockchain technology. As VeChain leverages UFC\u2019s massive global audience, this deal has the potential to not only propel VeChain\u2019s brand recognition but also educate fight fans about the possibilities of blockchain technology.

Ahmed was also ordered to forfeit the stolen crypto and pay restitution to the affected exchanges. Engineer Exploits Crypto Vulnerabilities In $12 Million Hacks According to charging documents and court filings, Ahmed conducted two separate attacks on decentralized exchanges. In the first incident, which took place on July 2 and 3, 2022, he manipulated fake pricing data to generate approximately $9 million in inflated fees. Subsequently, Ahmed withdrew these fees in the form of cryptocurrency. Following the theft, Ahmed communicated with the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds, except $1.5 million, if the exchange did not involve law enforcement. Shortly after, on July 28, 2022, Ahmed targeted another decentralized exchange called Nirvana Finance. Exploiting a vulnerability in Nirvana\u2019s smart contracts, he purchased crypto assets at a lower price than intended and promptly resold them back to Nirvana at a higher price. Despite Nirvana offering a substantial \u201cbug bounty\u201d of up to $600,000 for the return of the stolen funds, Ahmed demanded $1.4 million. This led to the collapse of the exchange, which had lost all its possessed funds, approximately $3.6 million, due to Ahmed\u2019s attack. From Security Expert To Cybercriminal The investigation revealed that Ahmed used \u201cadvanced money laundering techniques\u201d to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds. These included token swap transactions, transferring fraud proceeds from the Solana (SOL) blockchain to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain through \u201cbridging,\u201d converting the funds to Monero, and then using overseas exchanges and cryptocurrency mixers such as Samourai Whirlpool. Ahmed, a US citizen, held a senior security engineer position at an international technology company at the time of the attacks. His resume showcased expertise in reverse engineering smart contracts and conducting blockchain audits, skills that he utilized to execute the hacks. In addition to the three-year prison term, Ahmed was sentenced to three years of supervised release. He must forfeit approximately $12.3 million, including a significant amount of cryptocurrency, and pay the affected exchanges over $5 million in restitution. Commenting on Shakeeb Ahmed\u2019s sentencing, US Attorney Damian Williams said Today, Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to prison in the first-ever conviction for the hack of a smart contract and ordered to forfeit all of the stolen crypto. No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today\u2019s sentence shows, time in prison \u2014 and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto \u2014 is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks.

Allegedly, the companies participated in an elaborate scheme that resulted in the loss of AU$ 160 million, worth $104 million, from investors. ASIC After Unlicensed Mining Companies The Australian regulator commenced civil procedures against the NGS Group companies and their directors, Brett Mendham, Ryan brown, and Mark Ten Caten. The NGS Blockchain crypto mining companies include NGS Crypto, NGS Digital, and NGS Group. ASIC alleges that the NGS companies targeted Australian investors to acquire blockchain mining packages with a fixed-rate return. The regulator also accuses the companies of allegedly encouraging investors to use self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and convert the money into crypto. According to the NGS Crypto website, the company was formed in 2018 as a blockchain firm. As part of the NGS Group, the firm \u201caims to help members generate consistent returns.\u201d The Australian regulator stated in their press release that these financial services are being provided without the proper licensing. Due to this, ASIC is seeking \u201cinterim and final injunctions against the NGS Companies.\u201d ASIC Chair Joe Longo urged Australian users to consider the risks involving self-managing the SMSFs before using the funds to invest in crypto-related investment products like those offered by the NGS Group. Moreover, ASIC\u2019s Chair warned the industry about the regulator\u2019s standard to scrutinize crypto products: These proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinised by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers. The Australian regulator applied to the Federal Court to designate liquidators responsible for the companies\u2019 digital assets. The request was made because the regulator believed the investor\u2019s assets were \u201cat risk of dissipation.\u201d On Wednesday, the court approved the request and prevented Mendham from leaving the country. The preliminary investigations revealed that over 450 Australians invested AU$62 million, approximately $41 million, through the NGS Companies. Crypto Funds Busted For Irregularities Similarly, over 100 investors are owed over AUD$ 100 million, around $64.6 million, by the now-collapsing DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund. Recently, investigations started after investors denounced the crypto funds operated by Ash Balanian, an alleged former NASA mission scientist. As a result, liquidators were appointed to the three companies managed by Balanian. Per the report, the fund was geared at wealthy investors, requiring a minimum deposit of AU$ 50,000. Investors discovered irregularities in the fund\u2019s management, which resulted in the authorities\u2019 involvement. Numerous investors were concerned as they considered that the funds failed to hold the required licenses and \u201cbreached managed investment scheme requirements.\u201d On Wednesday, the Australian Federal Court ordered the freezing of Balanian\u2019s assets, worth AU$55 million, and the crypto fund manager to hand over his passport.","article_summary":"According to local reports, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has started legal procedures against two crypto companies and their directors for operating unlicensed in the country.

There Are Now More Than Five Million Litecoin Long-Term Holders According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the LTC network recently reached a new milestone in terms of its long-term holder count. The \u201clong-term holders\u201d (LTHs) here refer to Bitcoin investors who have held their coins for more than a year without moving or selling them. Note that IntoTheBlock chose this cutoff; other analytics firms have an LTH threshold between 5 and 6 months. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs, who hold for relatively long periods, are considered to carry a strong resolve. Historically, the LTHs rarely show selling activity, regardless of whatever happens in the rest of the market. The fickle-minded part of the sector that holds for relatively low timespans is called the short-term holder (STH) group. Participating STHs in selloffs isn\u2019t uncommon; it happens whenever significant volatility emerges, whether in the form of a rally or crash. On the other hand, it can be a notable event when the LTHs sell. One way to track the behavior of the LTHs is through the total number of addresses that qualify for the cohort. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that reveals the trend in this metric for Litecoin since the start of the year. As displayed in the above graph, the number of Litecoin LTH addresses has grown significantly over the last few months and has now reached the 5 million mark. This means that more than five million LTC wallets haven\u2019t made any move since at least a year ago. This corresponds to 62.5% of all addresses on the blockchain currently carrying some non-zero balance. This is a significant amount and suggests that most of the holder base has been interested in HODLing the cryptocurrency. Naturally, supply staying locked in the wallets of these diamond hands can be bullish due to how supply-demand dynamics tend to play out. Remember that any increases in the LTH addresses don\u2019t imply that HODLers are currently buying Litecoin. Rather, it suggests that some investors acquired coins a year ago, and they have only now been able to qualify for the group. Thus, the metric has a delay of 1 year attached between when accumulation happened and when it registers an increase. Selling doesn\u2019t carry the same restriction, as investors are immediately ejected from the cohort if they transfer their coins on the network. LTC Price Litecoin has continued to trade inside a range recently, as its price is currently floating around $95.","article_summary":"On-chain data shows that Litecoin\u2019s long-term holders have achieved a new record: 62.5% of all LTC investors now qualify as these HODLers.

Bitcoin Maxi Weighs In Ethereum Spot ETF Approval In the spot Ethereum ETF debate, notable voices from the cryptocurrency space have offered their perspectives. Renowned Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to the president of El Salvador, Max Keiser, has recently expressed skepticism regarding the SEC\u2019s cautious approach to approving an Ethereum ETF. Keiser, known for his staunch advocacy of Bitcoin and skepticism towards alternative cryptocurrencies, dismissed Ethereum as a \u201cproof-of-stake scam,\u201d suggesting it lacks the regulatory backing necessary for SEC approval.

Balchunas estimated the chances of approval at a mere 25%, further fueling uncertainty surrounding the prospect of an Ethereum ETF. Re Eth ETF approval, we are holding the line at 25% odds altho tbh it is a very pessimistic 25%. The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination.

Spot ETH ETF Gains Regulatory Interest Overseas Amidst the uncertainty surrounding the US SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum ETFs, reports suggest a contrasting regulatory environment in Hong Kong. According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong regulators may soon approve exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a potential shift in global regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrency investment products. If approved, these ETFs could offer investors new avenues for exposure to the digital asset market. Several firms are poised to launch ETFs pending regulatory clearance from the Securities and Futures Commission. Among the prospective issuers awaiting approval are international arms of Chinese asset manager Harvest Fund Management Co. and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital.

Notably, Deaton\u2019s campaign has gained significant support from industry leaders, indicating a growing demand for change in crypto regulation frameworks and a shift in approach towards the industry. Crypto Industry Backs Pro-XRP Lawyer\u2019s Senate Campaign According to a local report from Boston, Deaton, running as a Republican candidate, has personally loaned his campaign $1 million, showcasing his commitment to his uphill battle against Senator Warren. Since announcing his candidacy in mid-February, Deaton has also raised $360,690 from individual contributors, leaving him with nearly $1.4 million cash on hand. According to the Federal Election Commission, Deaton outraised Warren in the race\u2019s first quarter, with Deaton raising a total of $1.36 million to Warren\u2019s $1.1 million. Notable donations have come from influential figures such as Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum; Anthony Scaramucci, former communications director for Donald Trump and vocal crypto investor; and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of Gemini exchange. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company\u2019s executive chairman and co-founder, Chris Larsen, also contributed the maximum $6,600 each, split between the primary and general election campaigns, underscoring Deaton\u2019s support from key industry players. However, it should be noted that Deaton faces a challenging campaign against Warren, who has a significant financial advantage with $4.4 million in her campaign war chest. This solidifies her position as the \u201cheavy favorite\u201d to win the Senate battle against the pro-XRP attorney in what is considered a \u201creliably blue state.\u201d High-Stakes Senate Race A spokesperson for Warren emphasized that her campaign is powered by \u201csmall-dollar donations,\u201d emphasizing grassroots support rather than \u201cspecial interests attempting to elevate candidates.\u201d Nevertheless, Deaton\u2019s challenge against Warren extends beyond a political rivalry, representing the ongoing debate surrounding the role of cryptocurrencies and their regulation in the United States. Deaton has previously stated, \u201cRegular people are sick and tired of different rules being applied to Washington insiders. We need real leadership in Washington, DC.\u201d Deaton, an ex-US Naval officer from Detroit who attended Eastern Michigan University and New England Law Boston, moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island in late January, shortly before he announced his Senate candidacy. While Warren\u2019s record of service and establishment support pose significant challenges, the crypto industry\u2019s endorsement and call for change, coupled with the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, gives Deaton significant leverage in his campaign. The outcome of this high-profile race will not only determine a political representative but also shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.

This has caused a suppressed price action over the last week, stopping the meme coin\u2019s advancement in its tracks. However, the outlook still remains bullish for the DOGE price, with crypto analysts expecting the rally to continue soon and the price to double. Dogecoin Forms Bull Flag Pattern The Dogecoin performance over the past month has been quite encouraging, and despite hitting a roadblock with its rally, it has continued to show bullish tendencies. The most recent of the bullish moves which the meme coin has pulled is the formation of a bull flag pattern on its chart. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) article that the cryptocurrency\u2019s chart had showed something interesting on the daily chart. According to the analysis, the movements that Dogecoin has made over the last few weeks has led to a bull flag formation on the daily chart. Now, the main driver of the rally that is supposed to follow this formation is the DOGE price breaking out from the bull flag, which is yet to happen. But as the crypto analyst explains, a breakout from here would send Dogecoin\u2019s price at least 2x higher than its current level. A successful break above the $0.205 level would confirm this bullish formation. However, DOGE has been unable to achieve this, still trading below $0.2 at the time of writing. This could also be a hard-won battle for the meme coin as Bitcoin\u2019s uncertain moves continue to drag the crypto market down. When Will DOGE Make This Move? The month of April is expected to be bullish for the Dogecoin price, and the crypto analyst\u2019s price shows this. The expected timeframe for the bullish breakout is sometime this month, which would put it in the next few weeks. Trader Tardigrade\u2019s target shows an over 100% increase from the current price level, reaching as high as $0.4 in the short term. This move could be spurred on by the Bitcoin halving happening this month, which is expected to propel bullish sentiment. Expectations for the Bitcoin price are that it will reach $80,000, and this move would no doubt pull up the rest of the crypto market, causing coins like Dogecoin to surge. At the time of writing, the DOGE price was trending at $0.19, with a 1.61% decrease in the last 24 hours.

Gopax\u2019s Revenue Surge And Net Loss Reduction Despite challenges related to liquidity issues and regulatory scrutiny, Gopax narrowed its net loss to 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) last year, compared to 90.6 billion won in the previous year. The financial report further showcased Gopax\u2019s notable performance in 2023, with a roughly 97% year-over-year growth in revenue, reaching 3.1 billion won. Additionally, the exchange reduced its net operating loss by 78% to approximately 17 billion won. As reported, these positive results were largely attributed to the resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean crypto market, which emerged as one of the \u201cmost active\u201d crypto markets globally in 2023. Despite its revenue growth, Gopax encountered notable hurdles, particularly regarding its association with Genesis Global Capital, which had a subsequent halt of withdrawals stemming from a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement in FTX in 2022. The situation resulted in substantial losses for Gopax, with funds from its GoFi-linked debt stuck in Genesis Global Capital, totaling 63.7 billion won. However, Binance, Gopax\u2019s major shareholder, stepped in to address liquidity issues and \u201cacquired\u201d the exchange in February 2023, aiming to penetrate the South Korean market.

Binance\u2019s Global Challenges And Resilience However, Binance itself has been navigating regulatory challenges from several corners globally. Among these challenges is the $4.3 billion fine settlement with the US Department of Justice and even the crackdown from the Nigerian government. Additionally, the crypto exchange has recently faced a ban from the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As reported, the SEC\u2019s decision was based on Binance\u2019s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform in the region. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino noted: The SEC has identified the aforementioned [Binance] platform and concluded that the public\u2019s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos.

The proposal, labeled 0066 XLS\u201466d, aims to establish a censorship-resistant DeFi ecosystem within the network. It is currently open for public scrutiny on GitHub. New Lending Protocol on XRP Ledger Ripple unveiled the proposal for a native lending protocol on the XRPL. This protocol is poised to enhance XRPL\u2019s interaction with the DeFi ecosystem, marking a significant step towards improved financial inclusivity and transparency. The proposed protocol introduces a direct lending and borrowing mechanism that prioritizes flexibility and reusability. Notably, the protocol allows participants to contribute fungible tokens such as XRP, wBTC, and wETH to a lending pool to earn interest. The platform would also allow loan terms to be negotiated off-chain and then securely recorded on-chain. This streamlined process would facilitate user engagement and ensure transparency and security. \u201cThe Lending Protocol enables fixed-term loans with pre-set terms for interest-accruing loans. It bypasses the need for collateral by using off-chain underwriting, risk management, and a first-loss capital protection scheme in case of default,\u201d RippleX added.

While the proposal undergoes review and refinement, there is optimism regarding its potential impact on the XRP. Ripple CTO David Schwartz said it could introduce a new utility layer without deterring traditional finance entities from its use. \u201cIf passed, this could bring new utility to the XRPL.

Anza, a prominent infrastructure developer, successfully deployed version 1.18.11 as a congestion fix to the Solana devnet and invited validators to test its efficacy. Network Fixes Target Congestion The Solana-focused software development firm urged all testnet validators to upgrade their systems promptly to facilitate a thorough analysis of the impact of the proposed solution. Over the past weeks, Solana has grappled with elevated transaction failure rates, exacerbated by an influx of bots exploiting meme coin activity. As a result, several Solana-based protocols were forced to postpone their launch due to network congestion. Notably, there are indications that the situation might be improving. Phantom, the foremost wallet provider on Solana, revealed that its transaction success rates have significantly improved. \u201cFor the past 24 hours, our metrics show that transactions have been landing nearly 90% of the time, almost a 5x improvement from a week ago. Sending and swapping in Phantom should be much more reliable now. If you are still having issues, retrying should be a quick fix,\u201d Phantom said. Meanwhile, Jacob Creech, the head of developer relations at the Solana Foundation, praised the network\u2019s response to the congestion issues. \u201cIn the 2022 network congestion, core engineers were the main contributors to fixing the problem. Now we have core engineers, dapps, validators, RPCs, developers, and more laser-focused on improving UX. Solana\u2019s developer community is maturing. We will get past this and be even better for it,\u201d Creech stated. Despite improving the network\u2019s transaction situation, Solana experienced a 12% decline during the past day. This pushed its price below $140 for the first time in a month. However, the decline mirrored a broader market downturn that prompted over $860 million in crypto liquidations across major assets, including Bitcoin. This price movement marks a shock occurrence for Solana. SOL\u2019s price has been on an uptrend, rising by around 50% year-to-date. But, it has considerably struggled since peaking at above $200 in mid-March, declining by more than 13% during the past week, according to BeInCrypto data.

If that fix is working Monday, I can see us pump straight back to $200. If not, we\u2019ll probably see more negative price action and possibly a fall to $120-130 ranges,\u201d Crypto trader Thor wrote.

This raises concerns over users\u2019 potential exposure to malicious attacks. However, Telegram, known for its crypto-friendly messaging platform, has refuted these claims, asserting that such a vulnerability is absent within its system. Alleged Vulnerability on Telegram Certik claimed that Telegram\u2019s desktop application, specifically its media processing functionality, contained a significant Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. It allegedly exposes users to attacks through media files like images or videos. The firm specified that the vulnerability affects only desktop apps that execute programs contained within files. However, the mobile application remains unaffected. Telegram swiftly responded to CertiK\u2019s claims, stating that it could not verify the vulnerability and suggesting it could be misinformation. However, CertiK demonstrated an RCE attack on Telegram\u2019s latest Windows desktop version, reinforcing its initial claim. Consequently, it advised users to exercise caution until a complete resolution is reached. We REPRODUCED one RCE attack to the latest TG Desktop on Windows (release version 4.16.6 x64).

The firm clarified that the resolved vulnerability required specific user interactions and advanced conditions. \u201cCertik posted this after we notified them about a server-side fix for an issue which was similar to the one they initially hinted at (but required user interaction; required the user to have Python installed; and could not be triggered by automatic downloads),\u201d Telegram said.

However, insights from on-chain data reveal that certain large-scale investors, colloquially known as crypto whales, foresaw the downturn and offloaded a substantial portion of their holdings. Crypto Whales Offload Holdings On-chain analysts reported that several institutional investors strategically sold portions of their holdings during the market downturn. Four crypto whales collectively offloaded 31,683 ETH, valued at approximately $106 million. Among the identified crypto whales were notable entities such as Cumberland, an address linked to the bankrupt Alameda/FTX estate, and two undisclosed altcoin wallets. Cumberland, a prominent institutional crypto investment firm, deposited 17,206 ETH, amounting to $57.3 million, across various exchanges. On the other hand, two crypto whales, \u20180xC3f8\u2019 and \u20180x1717\u2019, moved 7,976 ETH worth $26.6 million and 4,000 ETH worth $13.32 million, respectively, to Binance and other exchanges.

US District Judge Victor Marrero handed down the sentence, marking a significant milestone in crypto-related law enforcement. DeFi Hacker Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison Shakeeb Ahmed utilized his extensive knowledge in reverse engineering and blockchain audits to manipulate smart contracts on the exchanges. US Attorney Damian Williams states this case represents the first-ever conviction for hacking a smart contract. \u201cNo matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice.

On July 2 and 3, 2022, Ahmed targeted the first exchange by injecting fake pricing data, generating $9 million in inflated fees, which he then illicitly withdrew. In a subsequent communication with the exchange, Ahmed agreed to return the stolen funds except for $1.5 million, provided the exchange did not report the attack to law enforcement. A few weeks later, on July 28, Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in Nirvana Finance\u2019s smart contracts. This second attack drained Nirvana of approximately $3.6 million, nearly all its funds, forcing the platform to shut down. Ahmed declined Nirvana\u2019s substantial bug bounty offer, opting to keep the stolen assets.

This follows after two high-ranking lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday to discuss the way forward. According to the initial report by Punchbowl News, the meeting was held in Schumer\u2019s office, shortly after the Japanese prime minister jointly addressed Congress the same day. Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters Keen on Stablecoin Reform Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have, so far, been very consistent in their bid to see the committee\u2019s stablecoin bill passed into law. So much so that their efforts played a huge part in the bill\u2019s passing at the House committee, albeit with a bipartisan vote. However, not much progress has been made since that passing, therefore blurring any hopes that the bill may be passed into law this year. First off, getting a floor vote in a House where there is ongoing infighting, especially among top Republicans, would be a difficult task. Also, the Senate Banking Committee hasn\u2019t lent any support or has shown any interest in the idea up until now. Despite these potential setbacks, however, McHenry and Waters are not willing to give up just yet. According to sources familiar with what was discussed on Thursday, the duo is looking to tie the stablecoin bill to a must-move item, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending bill. For McHenry, getting his panel\u2019s stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign into law is one of his priorities before retiring from Congress later this year. With Schumer now in the picture, there is a glimmer of hope that legislation that will guide issuers of stablecoins may just see the light of day. As of publication, efforts to reach out to McHenry and Waters for commentary have not yet yielded any results.

Throughout this week, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has shown strong volatility as we stare at Friday\u2019s Bitcoin options expiry. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6% up on the weekly chart at $70,922 with a market cap of $1.4 trillion. As per data from Greeks.live, a staggering 21,000 Bitcoin options are set to expire having a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put call ratio of 0.62. The max pain point for the expiry currently stands at $69,000. With the US CPI data and inflation coming higher than expected, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced stronger volatility. On the other hand, the implied volatility has declined which means that in the case of volatile price movements, the BTC price can tank further under $70,000. Furthermore, the Greeks.live data shows that the sell calls have dominated the Bitcoin trade over the past month and the optimism around Bitcoin halving seems to be waning. Also, with the slowdown in the Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC lacks enough impetus to continue with its rally ahead. As of now, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been largely consolidating in a tight range between $69,000-$71,000. Analysts believe that it could continue to consolidate up to halving without showing any major price movements. #BTC is still just consolidating between these two levels No major trend shift as we approach the Bitcoin Halving$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3nYdfEN9Sd pic.twitter.com/iaAQn27Tuj \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 11, 2024 Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $71,000 Over the last fortnight, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has faced a significant struggle moving past $71,000, clearly hinting at a strong bearish grip in the market. Critics speculate that the S&P 500\u2019s recent decline from its peak of 5265 on March 28 could foreshadow an economic downturn. Given Bitcoin\u2019s strong correlation with stocks, which surpassed 80% last month, its price might initially decline if market troubles persist. On the other hand, the BTC futures market continues to show signs of neutrality highlighting a healthy demand for leverage calls in comparison to the situation in March-end.

According to the report, the number of financing in the digital asset space increased by 50% in March to reach $1.6 million compared to February. The month witnessed a resurgence in institutional investments, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s climb to a new all-time high above $73,000 after a two-year downturn. Pushed by positive market sentiments, investors directed funds into 180 crypto projects across various sectors. Market Dynamics and Investment Trends The KuCoin research found a continuous growth trend in both the number and scale of investment and financing projects compared to the previous year. The company said the growth signals a robust revival in the primary investment market within the current crypto economy. While the financing scale between $10 and $100 million notably increased from 16.6% in February to 28.81% in March, seed-stage financing projects saw a slight decline from 40.86% to 37.8%. Despite this increase, strategic stage financing projects surged to 22.83% from 16.13%. Blockchain Performance and Investor Focus In terms of blockchain performance, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Polygon (MATIC) projects attracted substantial investor attention, especially following Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions after the Dencun upgrade. While Bitcoin and Polygon remained strong, Ethereum, through its layer-2 scaling solutions, topped the chart after the Dencun upgrade. For active venture capital companies participating in the crypto industry, OKX Ventures leads the way, emerging as the leader among other investors. The company participated in a total of 20 projects in March, followed by MH and Waterdrip. When it comes to the top ten sectors that received significant attention from venture capital, key sectors such as Infrastructure (Infra), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Games dominated venture capital investments. In March, investment institutions favored themes revolving around AI, DEX, and Lending projects.

This new feature ensures the security and fairness of crypto transactions. The implementation of this solution is a direct response to user complaints about technical issues and hacking incidents, showing the wallet\u2019s commitment to improving the overall crypto experience for its large user base. MEV Protection coincides with an upgrade to Trust Wallet\u2019s Swaps feature, which now allows seamless exchanges with over 1 million token pairs across multiple networks and providers. This dual advancement showcases its dedication to facilitating secure swaps in the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding MEV and Its Impact Miner Extractable Value is a concept in the blockchain industry that refers to the potential profit miners, validators, and other participants can gain by manipulating the order, censorship, or insertion of transactions within a block. These attacks exploit this vulnerability, enabling malicious actors to manipulate transaction orders for personal gain. They result in increased slippage, less favorable execution prices, and an unfair trading experience for regular users. MEV Protection: A Comprehensive Solution The introduction of MEV Protection is aimed at countering this attack. The security measure safeguards users\u2019 swaps from front-running and sandwich attacks, which are common tactics used by bad actors in the crypto space. Front-running involves exploiting knowledge of a pending transaction to execute a similar transaction before it, thereby manipulating the market price. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, require trapping a legitimate transaction between two malicious ones to profit from price slippage. The MEV protocol ensures that users receive fair market prices for their swaps, protecting them from the risk of paying more or receiving less than the prevailing market rate. This feature benefits both experienced traders and those new to crypto, creating a safer and more secure environment for all swap participants. Easy Access to MEV Protection Accessing this new feature is a simple process. Users can select the swap option from the bottom menu, click on the settings button in the top right corner, and enable the MEV protection features. This will also make it available on all devices connected to the account, ensuring a seamless and secure trading experience and automatically opting users in for an additional layer of security from the beginning. This approach further showcases its commitment to transparency and providing a user-focused Web3 experience. In addition, the crypto wallet further places a strong emphasis on user education and empowerment, ensuring that its community is well-informed about the security measures that it has put in place. The introduction of this new development has received praise from the Trust Wallet community. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! Congratulations on adding MEV Protection. Now we can swap with peace of mind.

The training, done as part of the firm\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility is to help bolster law enforcement\u2019s understanding of blockchain technology, particularly as Hong Kong continues its push as the new darling of the crypto economy. According to a local media source, the training sessions were conducted for the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) and Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB). Web3 Companies and Authorities Jointly Fight Crypto Crimes With the increasing prominence of Hong Kong in the cryptocurrency space, Bitrace CEO Isabel says it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between Web3 companies and the authorities. She maintains that the training is targeted at equipping law enforcement officers with the necessary skills and knowledge to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes effectively. Isabel, while delivering a comprehensive overview of crypto-assets application in cybercrime, highlighted some challenges including the fact that regulatory agencies lag behind in understanding crypto-criminal methods. Many crypto crime fighters do not also know that encrypted crime investigation is usually multi-layered, and the low efficiency of collaboration among stakeholders. The Bitrace CEO insisted that it is necessary to protect the security of users\u2019 funds and foster a healthier and safer Web3 environment by strengthening partnerships with regulatory agencies. The capacity-building sessions delved into various aspects of crypto-related crimes such as online gambling, illicit asset trading, money laundering, and fraud. Last year, Anatoly Legkodymov, the former CEO of Bitzlato, pleaded guilty to facilitating the laundering of illicit funds totaling $700 million. Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace\u2019s technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities. Real-life case studies were analyzed to provide insights into encryption crime methods and the flow of criminal funds on the blockchain. Bitrace Capabilities Beyond Hong Kong Police Training Besides the training, Bitrace also engaged in discussions with the Commercial Crimes Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau. The aim is to foster collaboration between regulatory agencies and Web3 companies. Prior to the training, the regulatory authorities have tried to keep the space sane. For instance, last month, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong had flagged suspected crypto fraud with HKCEXP to prevent users from falling victim to scams. Analysts say Bitrace is well suited to provide capacity building for Hong Kong police as it has advanced analytics capabilities, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms and has enabled the accumulation of a vast address tag library. This library includes entity tags such as DeFi platforms, mining pools, and digital asset exchanges, as well as risk behavior tags like fraud, money laundering, and illegal online gambling. Thus, by utilizing this technology, regulatory authorities can swiftly identify suspicious addresses and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto transactions. Industry watchers hope that the collaboration addresses the challenges posed by crypto-related crimes. This is paramount as the Hong Kong SFC is set to green light spot Bitcoin ETFs in the region anything from now.next Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace's technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities.

While the outcome did not guarantee an outright ouster of the current sitting president, Yoon Suk Yeol, all indicators point to a one-term tenure ending in three years. Furthermore, the opposition\u2019s landslide victory has led to the resignation of Han Dong-hoon and Han Duck-soo as the party leader of the People Power Party (PPP) and Prime Minister respectively. Notably, South Korea\u2019s opposition parties jointly won 192 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. If the opposition parties managed to reach 200 seats, the current president would be impeached. Nonetheless, the remaining three years for the current president will be extremely difficult with the opposition controlling the National Assembly. What South Korea\u2019s Opposition Win Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets South Korea is one of the leading developed countries that have significantly adopted the web3 industry and digital assets. The high adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets in South Korea, amounting to over 6 million people, had a significant influence in the just concluded parliamentary election. Furthermore, both sides of the political aisle had promised reward packages for the cryptocurrency industry if elected in the country\u2019s National Assembly. On one side, the PPP had vowed to delay a digital asset tax and allow investors to thrive in the nascent sector. On the other hand, the Democratic Party pledged to allow South Korean investors to tap into spot Bitcoin ETFs both locally and overseas.

The arguments follow data that shows that South Korean investors purchased more than $200 million of MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR). Additionally, more investors from South Korea have been trading crypto futures ETFs. Meanwhile, it will remain a game of waiting to see if the president will bend to the National Assembly\u2019s rules and vice versa. Market Picture The cryptocurrency market remains in a macro bullish outlook with the Bitcoin halving 2024 about 9 days from happening. The fact that the United States has struggled to tame the dollar inflation is a direct reflection of the global economic situation. Furthermore, some countries led by El Salvador have been purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and global geopolitical instability.

In a meeting, several state agencies called for regulating P2P crypto trading and digital asset purchases to protect people from financial loss. Thailand to Prevent Scammers from Cleaning Money via P2P Trades In attendance were representatives from several agencies, including the Defense Ministry, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, the Royal Thai Police, and the Bank of Thailand. Others were the Department of Special Investigation, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association, the Interior Ministry, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, and the Department of Special Investigation. The meeting was led by the Thai Minister for Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Jantararuangthong. The participants met following a recent order from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. The Prime Minister gave agencies 30 days to disclose plans to crack down on growing online fraud. According to a Bangkok Post publication, online scammers take the proceeds from their illicit activities and pass them through crypto exchanges and trading platforms via P2P trading. This helps to minimize the risk of being traced, making it difficult for authorities to find and prosecute scammers. According to Prasert\u2019s ministry, 80% of the 100 million baht ($2.7 million) worth of daily fraud recorded in Thailand passes through P2P channels. The ministry believes this is an easy way for fraudsters to clean the money because these fund transfers are unregulated. The Minister tasked the SEC with finding ways to regulate P2P trades to prevent money laundering. No VAT for Crypto in Thailand According to the SEC, there are 2 million crypto accounts held by individuals in Thailand. Current regulations focus on regulating crypto trading, especially targeting unauthorized exchanges. The new effort is to widen regulatory activities to ensure that P2P trading is scrutinized as part of current efforts. However, Prasert assures that registered platforms will not be targeted: \u201cThe move to regulate the P2P platform would not affect cryptocurrency traders on authorized exchanges.\u201d The Minister plans to offer a regulation scheme to the Prime Minister if the SEC cannot modify existing regulations. In addition to P2P trading, the agencies also hope to tackle online fraud and call center scams. Thailand is working on establishing the country as a digital asset hub. In February, the Ministry of Finance excluded crypto trading from value-added tax (VAT) requirements to encourage the use of digital assets. According to the Finance Minister\u2019s secretary, Paopoom Rojanasakul, the vision is to support crypto adoption to drive the digital economy.

In the bid to propose solutions, Layer 2 (L2) technologies have emerged, offering the potential to ease the strain on the base layer and unlock new possibilities for the digital asset. However, the path to scalability has sparked a divisive debate within the crypto community, with supporters expressing their concerns about the advantages and potential risks of various L2 implementations. If your Bitcoin L2 doesn't support unilateral exit, that's not your L2 that's a multisig. pic.twitter.com/Ors4ZvpmjX \u2014 mononaut (tx/acc) (@mononautical) April 10, 2024 A notable critic is the developer of Mempool, Mononaut, who has expressed their concerns about various BTC L2 solutions. Their critique covers a range of factors, including the involvement of venture capital (VC) investors and the issuance of separate tokens, as well as the centralized or federated structures that underpin some of these initiatives. The developer\u2019s concerns also extend to projects that offer reciprocal rewards based on user deposits, which they liken to pyramid schemes, and those that incentivize long-term lockups of coins, drawing comparisons to offerings like Hex. Additionally, he was skeptical of L2 platforms that lack comprehensive technical documentation, dismissing them as mere copies of the infamous Bitconnect scheme with a superficial disguise. In a post on X, they said: \u201cIf your Bitcoin L2 has no whitepaper or technical details, only 20 pages of documentation on how to deposit BTC and calculate your future yield, that\u2019s not your L2 that\u2019s Bitconnect wearing a false moustache.\u201d Echoing these concerns is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), who has openly questioned the effectiveness of Bitcoin\u2019s L2 solutions compared to the scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson argues that BTC\u2019s inherent design limitations make it incredibly challenging to implement additional functionality, often requiring the deployment of centralized or federated infrastructures \u2013 a compromise that, in his opinion, undermines the fundamental principles of the coin. The Optimist\u2019s Perspective: Envisioning Bitcoin\u2019s L2-Driven Future However, not all voices in the cryptosphere share this skepticism. Proponents of L2 technologies, like Yago, an X user with over twenty thousand followers, remain steadfast in his belief that these solutions will propel BTC to new heights, making it a cornerstone of modern civilization. He envisions a future where BTC becomes intertwined with various aspects of our lives, driven by the asset\u2019s increasing value as L2 implementations unlock new use cases and efficiencies. It is evident that both sides of the argument present strong and convincing opinions, stating the challenge of promoting new ideas while remaining true to the coin\u2019s commitment to decentralization, which has been the foundation of its success. The Layer 2 solutions offer the potential for the future of BTC by creating opportunities as the Bitcoin community continues to grow and generate innovative ideas. In recent times, we have witnessed a series of developments that have transformed the crypto space, such as AI-enhanced gaming in the crypto space and improved digital wallets that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and additional features for managing digital assets. Nevertheless, the full impact of these changes is still unknown due to their rapid pace of occurrence.next Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users The developer of Mempool Mononaut has expressed concerns about various BTC L2 solutions.

It has taken the crypto market by storm and has become the hottest crypto of the week. A reason for the fast-growing attention is that BEFE coin enjoys unique features that make it exceptional compared to other meme coins, and this has kept it on the radar of investors globally. BEFE has outperformed many meme coins, even the ones with bigger popularity, because it is embedded with utilities, making it a project that gives value, unlike others waiting for a pleasant market condition. BEFE Coin, Not Your Regular Meme Coin Meme coins are characterized by using memes to gain traction in the cryptocurrency sector. Most meme coins rely on hype as utilities are not the priority, making them a bad option for long-term investments. Many investors habitually seek meme coins that can give them the profit they seek temporarily while reinvesting in some other coins that could serve as good long-term options. BEFE is rewriting the narrative as it brings excitement and utility, making investors yearn for the project offerings while maintaining the hype around it. This approach by BEFE is superb as it encourages sustainability. It breaks BEFE free from being controlled by general market conditions to being controlled by investors\u2019 interest in offerings. This is the primary reason BEFE stands out from others. It can potentially give mouthwatering returns at every market phase as demand regularly increases. Strategic Partnerships Pushing BEFE To The Limelight The height BEFE attained results from the kind of partnership it has engaged in. Partnerships are very instrumental factors for growth. With the right partnership, all parties benefit massively, and growth is ensured. BEFE\u2019s partnership with Bitgert is a perfect example of a symbiotic partnership where all parties benefit.

It is exploding onto the scene as a favorite with the highest and cutting-edge solutions. Now, let\u2019s look at what makes Bitgert stand out. The Bitgert Ecosystem Bitgert is an outstanding crypto initiative aspiring to bring radical changes into the blockchain space with a wide spectrum of products and audit solutions. In less than 200 days since launch, the project launched its own Blockchain, BRISE Wallet, Audits, Swap, Staking, and the Bitgert Exchange service, which confirms a rapid pace of development in the ecosystem. This project has many appealing investment side deals: staking rewards paid in BUSD and a strategically devised buyback plan to improve the value and rareness of the token. Bitgert currently trades at a market capitalization of $77,690,191, with a fully diluted valuation of $83,850,485, noting that they have a lively 24-hour trading volume of $2,219,396. Bitgert hit an all-time high of $0.0000051842 on March 7, 2022, which is 89.3% over the current value. Its all-time low price was at $0.0000000096166 on September 9, 2021, way higher by 31,797.12% now, evidently showing how the project moved from the price most importantly in its development. Bitgert had declined by 8.50% in price over the past week. However, with all this innovation and their ability to deploy blockchain products so fast, Bitgert remains one of the projects with quite good potential in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Major Advantages Posed by BRISE Below are some of the benefits that Bitgert (BRISE) would bring to the crypto market, thus making it an outstanding option for consideration: Bitgert introduced BRC20 blockchain, remarkable for making its users pay almost no gas fees, literally 0.0000000000001 dollars for the whole transaction. This innovation would place Bitgert as one of the lowest-cost options to place, further reducing the barrier that costs represent in transactions within the blockchain. The throughput capacity for the BRC20 blockchain is up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). This, therefore, brings a very high transaction speed that is efficient even in cross-chain transactions. This kind of speed is good enough to make sure that users\u2019 experiences are not undermined, like waiting for too long to process a given transaction, even during peak times. The Bitgert ecosystem duly covers DeFi, NFT, Web 3.0, and Metaverse, putting the project to its place as a one-stop-shop service for all your needs in many different blockchain technologies. Bitgert token is engineered with a buy-back mechanism specific for reserving 5% of every transaction fee to acquire tokens and support token price, thus making it a deflationary asset. Besides, the staking benefits the investor with a total tax commission of 12% on the network, encouraging holding for the long term and attracting investment on the platform. End Call Bitgert is the best crypto right now, which you can buy in/hold if you believe in the ecosystem\u2019s future sustainability. The entire ecosystem is utility-driven, probing investors with optimistic return potentials for the future. Regardless, individual research and risk appetite knowledge are always mandatory before final buy-in.

It eclipses MAGA and the Pepe Coin price predictions this year despite these two established projects enjoying excellent performance in Q1 2024. While MAGA and Pepe Coin prices rise, meme coin enthusiasts have been drawn to the Raboo presale, which recently launched at just $0.0036. As analysts forecast 233% returns during the ICO, it is no wonder many experts have Raboo topping their list of hot meme coins this year. Raboo: Meme coin newcomer fusing AI and meme culture Raboo\u2019s highly anticipated presale has caught the imagination for many reasons. Its fully audited contract makes the most of Ethereum\u2019s renowned reliability and security, allowing users to enjoy an engagement-focused approach. This includes prize draws, competitions, and regular events to keep the Raboo community fully engaged. The enduring combination of SocialFi mechanics and AI technology enables users to generate memes and share them across social media platforms in return for rewards through Raboo\u2019s unique Post-to-Earn platform. Other features include an NFT launch, an online marketplace, and several other exciting community initiatives designed to fulfill Raboo\u2019s promise as one of 2024\u2019s hot meme coins. With 233% price growth forecasts during the presale giving way to potential 100x returns on launch day, meme enthusiasts are flocking to Raboo, one of the year\u2019s hot meme coins, in their thousands. Pepe Coin price surges \u2013 can it maintain momentum Pepe was one of 2023\u2019s hot meme coins, surging to a $1.5 billion market cap within weeks of launching despite confessing to little inherent value. However, as the Pepe Coin price significantly surged in Q1 2024, the Pepe community has grown loyal, vibrant, and engaged. Pepe\u2019s integration of NFTs allows users to own and trade unique digital assets. At the same time, the Pepe Coin price receives boosts from regular token burns and excellent token staking opportunities in return for a passive income. With a growing community focus and big-name celebrity backing, experts back the Pepe Coin price to beat its current ATH set on March 14, 2024, sooner rather than later. Can MAGA go viral during election year? With the US election only months away, MAGA (Make America Great Again) and its native TRUMP token are enjoying serious price action. Although remaining well short of its ATH of $11.63, recorded on March 4, 2024, MAGA\u2019s current price of $4.64 is again rising as popular support for the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump surges. Whether MAGA can usurp its record levels and the candidate it backs can retake the White House remains to be seen. Still, with meme enthusiasts enjoying the wild ride offered by the TRUMP token, it would take a brave soul to bet against both happening during the imminent bull market. Conclusion While the MAGA and Pepe Coin prices continue to grow, having recently set ATHs, the meme coin market is bubbling nicely ahead of the imminent Bitcoin halving. However, both could be eclipsed by one of the hot meme coins joining the scene this year, Raboo. With outstanding features and enormous growth potential, Raboo could be the crypto find of the year.

With a very low likelihood of receiving approval, despite much attention being directed at the surging price of Bitcoins, Ethereum enthusiasts are anxiously waiting to know what the future holds for their preferred digital asset. While interest in an Ethereum ETF is declining, investors are looking for alternative ways to diversify their investment portfolios. One such project gaining traction involves ALGT, a native token of Algotech, a decentralized algorithmic trading platform. Offering the promise of advanced technologies and automation, this presents a lucrative opening for investors who want more than traditional cryptocurrencies. Analyzing Ethereum Price Amidst Halving Speculation With Bitcoin halving around the corner, many crypto enthusiasts wonder about Ethereum\u2019s future after this event. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s halving, which has historically resulted in a price boost, it is hard to predict whether the same will happen to Ethereum. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,503.32 with a 5% drop over the last 24 hours, but ETH experienced a 6% rebound from its March 29th lows, following Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 5.8% bounce. Despite these gains, bullish momentum remained subdued, urging caution for long traders. Technical indicators suggested increasing selling pressure and bearish short-term sentiment, even as exchange reserves dwindled, indicating accumulation. Overvaluation seemed unlikely due to the neutral position of RSI at around 50 and undervaluation according to the 30-day MVRV ratio, which implied a lack of any other wave for selling. Nevertheless, decreased Daily Active Addresses and a declining Social Dominance chart indicate weakening social engagement and persistent sales pressure that implies possible further losses despite the increase in Open Interest. Ethereum ETF Approval Doubts Grow Amidst SEC\u2019s Silence As Bitcoin approaches its halving event, there is speculation that the United States will not approve Ethereum ETFs. Indications show that regulatory hurdles may block the launching of such investment products despite investor enthusiasm. With the SEC exhibiting its unwillingness to consider and comment on Ethereum ETF filings, optimism is no longer there. SEC\u2019s May deadline could disappoint issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, which anticipate approval for Ethereum ETFs. Further complicating matters is the regulatory uncertainty surrounding how Ethereum should be classified, making the regulatory environment difficult for ETF issuers to navigate. Investors Flock to ALGT Token, Ongoing Presale Raised $3.7M Against the backdrop of regulatory uncertainty and ETF rejections, investors are turning to Algotech native token ALGT (ERC-20 tokens) as a viable alternative. The ongoing presale of ALGT has garnered significant attention, with the project\u2019s ongoing presale raising over $3.7 million. The platform\u2019s cutting-edge technology and commitment to empowering traders through intelligent trading strategies are resonating with investors seeking innovative solutions. Algotech offers a broad scope of algorithmic strategies designed to optimize client success and provide transparency and scalability. It strives to limit possible losses and improve trading performance within changing financial markets by having a solid technical infrastructure and sophisticated risk management techniques. Moreover, because of its decentralized nature, it ensures that its users enjoy safe and reliable trade. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving is a chance for investors to take advantage of both sides of the cryptocurrency market divide. Even though it is still possible that Ethereum prices could rise sharply, some regulatory obstacles seem to put question marks on its future potential in terms of ETF approvals. However, investors are seeking alternative options like Algotech\u2019s ALGT ERC-20 tokens to sieve through the ever-changing financial world.

The ORDI token crashed by over 15% in the past 24 hours and has retreated by over 50% from its highest point this year. Fantom, on the other hand, crashed by over 8% in the past 24 hours and has retreated by more than 45% from the year-to-date high. Similarly, the AAVE token plunged to a low of $72.76, which is much lower than the year-to-date high of $153.90. The other most popular laggards were coins like KuCoin Token (KCS), XRP, and Ethereum Classic. Not all cryptocurrencies were in the red. Bittensor (TAO) token rose by over 20% in the past 24 hours while Celestia (TIA), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Wormhole (W) soared by more than 10%. BitBot too continued its token sale, raising over $2 million. Why cryptocurrencies plunged There are three main reasons why cryptocurrencies crashed during the weekend. First, crypto investors are likely selling the news as the Bitcoin halving event is set to happen in less than two weeks. This situation is known as buying the rumour and selling the news. They have already bought the rumour as the coin has surged from below $20,000 to a high of over $73,000. Second, they crashed because of the geopolitical risks that accelerated during the weekend. Iran retaliated against Israel by firing over 300 drones and rockets. Most of these strikes were unsuccessful, helped by the country\u2019s iron dome. These tensions mean that the price of crude oil could continue rising in the coming weeks. Brent, the global benchmark, has already jumped to a multi-month high of $92. Third, there are signs that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates in the coming months as was widely expected. That explains why the US dollar index has jumped while US equities and bonds have retreated. Still, in the long term, analysts believe that cryptocurrencies will continue doing well because of Bitcoin. Besides, the coin is still getting rare because of halving while institutional investors are moving to the coin. BitBot token sale intensifies BitBot is thriving even as the crypto sell-off continues. The developers have already raised over $2.3 million from investors and are slowly nearing stage ten\u2019s target of $2.5 million. For starters, BitBot is one of the most ambitious companies in the blockchain industry. The developers are aiming to disrupt the fast-growing Telegram bot market that has been rife with fraud for years. BitBot will be a Telegram bot with some of the most advanced features in the industry. In addition to technical indicators, the platform will have advanced artificial intelligence (AI) features that will help give near-accurate signals. Further, BitBot will be powered by blockchain technology, which will help to reduce or prevent fraud. This technology will also help to decentralize the network, making it possible for all token holders to take advantage of its governance. You can buy the BitBot token here.

Investors are looking for better opportunities to invest and gain lucrative profits if that happens. According to some analysts, Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), and Borroe Finance ($ROE) could be some of the best altcoins to include in investment portfolios. Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, is bullish on the crypto market, predicting that the crypto market cap could double and reach around $5 trillion by the end of 2024. Garlinghouse believes spot ETF approval and the Bitcoin halving event will fuel this prediction. But he also emphasized the crucial impact of favourable U.S. regulatory changes on the crypto market\u2019s growth. The crypto community is understandably excited about this market prediction, with investors and analysts digging into the numbers to determine which tokens could be the best bets to capitalize on this growth. Many experts believe SOL, SUI and Borroe Finance ($ROE) could be some of the top crypto coins to consider adding to your portfolio ahead of this market expansion. Let\u2019s take a look at their reasoning. Solana validators approve \u2018Timely Vote Credits\u2019 Solana validators have agreed on a \u201cTimely Vote Credits\u201d plan, which speeds up transactions. It does so by modifying the consensus vote latency. The proposal was passed on April 8 with 98% votes. Besides, SOL was trading around $172 in the second week of April with minor fluctuations. Experts say it is near the crucial support level of $170. If it breaks down from here then, SOL might trade around $160 by mid-2024. However, if Solana (SOL) price manages to stay above $172, then it could head towards $190 and eventually to $200. If the bullish momentum persists then SOL could trade around $250 by the end of 2024. Is SUI ready to take off? SUI has risen by 290% in the past year, from a low of $0.37 in October to its current price of $1.46. In mid-April, Sui was trading around $1.57 with the crypto market cap of $2 billion. SUI has been fluctuating between $1.35 and $2.15 in the past month. Experts say SUI is in a downtrend now, with the support at $1.55. If it breaks below this support zone, then SUI could trade around $1.30 by mid-2024. Still, many analysts are optimistic about SUI\u2019s growth potential, with some indicating that if it breaks above the resistance level of $1.70, then it will move towards $1.80. By the end of 2024, SUI has the potential to trade around $2.50, according to a number of forecasts. Borroe Finance presale on fire Borroe Finance is attracting investors in its final stage of the presale. They raised over $3.66 million by selling over 282 million $ROE tokens. In Stage 5, $ROE is priced at $0.02 per token, and it will be listed at a price of $0.025 across several exchanges. This will generate 25% profit for new investors. In addition, current investors are also enjoying a 15% bonus when they use a promo code (\u201cWELCOME\u201d), but data suggests there are now only 153 million $ROE tokens left to be sold. Borroe Finance aims to revolutionize Web3 business funding through blockchain, AI-powered risk assessments, and smart contracts. It offers quicker access to capital by allowing businesses to mint and sell NFTs. These NFTs represent their future revenue. ROE utilizes the Polygon blockchain for its efficiency and low fees. The team is experienced and always brings their best to the table. Some crypto analysts are predicting that Borroe Finance could be one of the best blockchain ICOs in the market today, which is why many investors are to HODLing $ROE tokens.

Avalanche (AVAX) forms cross-chain asset settlements with ANZ and Chainlink, sparking bullish predictions after its recent price decline. Filecoin (FIL) sees a 12% surge with its Swan Chain integration. In recent weeks, Milei Moneda ($MEDA) has emerged among top contenders in crypto presales, capturing the attention of new investors eager to capitalize on its strong presale potential. Alongside the bullish potential of $MEDA, the crypto market is witnessing notable developments with Avalanche (AVAX) and Filecoin (FIL). Let\u2019s explore these bullish crypto stories. Milei Moneda eyes 60% ROI for early investors As digital investors seek the best coins to invest in for substantial returns, one name that keeps popping up is Milei Moneda ($MEDA). The DeFi meme coin has been making waves with its unique blend of humor, politics, and blockchain technology infused with Anarcho-capitalism. Milei Moneda ($MEDA) is an Ethereum Network-based deflationary token boasting locked liquidity and a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens. Its deflationary feature and strategic distribution system have made Milei Moneda ($MEDA) one of the top sorted altcoins, with the meme coin recording a sale of over 56 million tokens in just weeks since its presale debut. Currently selling at $0.0125 in Stage 2 of its presale, $MEDA is getting close to its highly anticipated launch on Uniswap. Scheduled for May 21, Milei Moneda\u2019s DeFi coin price is set to launch at $0.020, translating to a 60% ROI for Stage 2 investors. This promising outlook has added to the excitement surrounding the price recovery of top altcoins Avalanche (AVAX) and Filecoin (FIL). Avalanche teams up with ANZ for cross-chain asset settlements Avalanche (AVAX) recently announced a partnership with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Chainlink (LINK) Labs. This collaboration aims to leverage Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect Avalanche and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains, enabling seamless delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets across networks in multiple currencies. News of the collaboration ignited significant interest in Avalanche, boosting bullish price predictions for AVAX\u2019s price. Since the beginning of April, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen its bears in control, recording a 5% decline in its altcoin price. However, with this recent collaboration, market analysts anticipate a price recovery in the coming weeks. Filecoin rebounds after ATH dip: Swan Chain integration fuels price surge Like Avalanche (AVAX), Filecoin (FIL) has been quite volatile for the past few weeks. In March, Filecoin dropped for the year\u2019s ATH, plummeting by over 20%. However, the altcoin made a 12% price recovery recently, fueled by the network\u2019s integration with Swan Chain, a Layer 2 network compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Filecoin\u2019s integration with Swan Chain not only enhances storage capabilities but also offers users the ability to seamlessly integrate decentralized computing, bandwidth, and payments within a single suite. The integration has generated enthusiasm within the crypto community, reflecting positively on FIL\u2019s price. As Filecoin\u2019s utility expands through innovative integrations like Swan Chain, analysts predict continued growth and price appreciation for FIL in the coming weeks.

Investors are looking for better opportunities to invest and gain lucrative profits if that happens. According to some analysts, Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), and Borroe Finance ($ROE) could be some of the best altcoins to include in investment portfolios. Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, is bullish on the crypto market, predicting that the crypto market cap could double and reach around $5 trillion by the end of 2024. Garlinghouse believes spot ETF approval and the Bitcoin halving event will fuel this prediction. But he also emphasized the crucial impact of favorable U.S. regulatory changes on the crypto market\u2019s growth. The crypto community is understandably excited about this market prediction, with investors and analysts digging into the numbers to determine which tokens could be the best bets to capitalize on this growth. A growing number of experts believe SOL, SUI and $ROE could be some of the top crypto coins to consider adding to your portfolio ahead of this market expansion. Let\u2019s take a look at their reasoning. Solana validators approve \u2018Timely Vote Credits\u2019 Solana validators have agreed on a \u201cTimely Vote Credits\u201d plan, which speeds up transactions. It does so by modifying the consensus vote latency. The proposal was passed on April 8 with 98% votes. Besides, SOL was trading around $172 in the second week of April with minor fluctuations. Experts say it is near the crucial support level of $170. If it breaks down from here then, SOL might trade around $160 by mid-2024. However, if SOL manages to stay above $172, then it could head towards $190 and eventually to $200. If the bullish momentum persists then SOL could trade around $250 by the end of 2024. Is SUI ready to take off? SUI has risen by 290% in the past year, from a low of $0.37 in October to its current price of $1.46. In mid-April, Sui was trading around $1.57 with the crypto market cap of $2 billion. SUI has been fluctuating between $1.35 and $2.15 in the past month. Experts say SUI is in a downtrend now, with the support at $1.55. If it breaks below this support zone, then SUI could trade around $1.30 by mid-2024. Still, many analysts are optimistic about SUI\u2019s growth potential, with some indicating that if it breaks above the resistance level of $1.70, then it will move towards $1.80. By the end of 2024, SUI has the potential to trade around $2.50, according to a number of forecasts. Borroe Finance presale is on fire Borroe Finance is attracting investors in its final stage of the presale. They raised over $3.66 million by selling over 282 million $ROE tokens. In Stage 5, $ROE is priced at $0.02 per token, and it will be listed at a price of $0.025 across several exchanges. This will generate 25% profit for new investors. In addition, current investors are also enjoying a 15% bonus when they use a promo code (\u201cWELCOME\u201d), but data suggests there are now only 153 million $ROE tokens left to be sold. Borroe Finance aims to revolutionize Web3 business funding through blockchain, AI-powered risk assessments, and smart contracts. It offers quicker access to capital by allowing businesses to mint and sell NFTs. These NFTs represent their future revenue. $ROE utilizes the Polygon blockchain for its efficiency and low fees. The team is experienced and always brings their best to the table. Some crypto analysts are predicting that Borroe Finance could be the best blockchain ICO in the market right now, which is why many investors are deciding to HODL $ROE tokens.

DOGE, with massive community backing, is an example of how hype can impact the price of a token. Some traders are already seeing it touch the $1 mark sooner than later, but that will depend on multiple factors. While we see how it goes, a new ICO, InQubeta, is competing with the likes of Chainlink and Monero. Will Dogecoin touch the $1 mark? Dogecoin has made quite the splash recently, riding the wave of meme culture straight into the hearts of a diverse crowd. It\u2019s not just the seasoned crypto heads getting in on the action but also those looking for a fun entry point into the world of digital money. Dogecoin stands out, not so much for its tech or financial chops, but for its vibe: it\u2019s all about community. Yet, hitting that $1 dream is tricky. Detractors often say Dogecoin\u2019s more about hype than substance, lacking the solid foundation other top crypto coins have. But DOGE believers see a different picture: its acceptance by more and more merchants and its die-hard community could mean Dogecoin\u2019s joke could have the last laugh, making it a serious player in the crypto game. As Dogecoin starts popping up more in everyday transactions and online shops start accepting it, it\u2019s beginning to shake off its meme coin image, hinting that its cultural clout could indeed cement its place in the crypto world with real, lasting value. InQubeta: A new vanguard in AI crypto investment While Dogecoin captures headlines with its rollercoaster market antics, a new name, InQubeta, is quietly turning heads among savvy investors. Positioned as a serious rival to crypto veterans like Monero and Chainlink, InQubeta stands out by weaving the untapped potential of AI into the fabric of crypto investments. InQubeta is on a mission to simplify access to the once-gated world of AI startups, offering a golden ticket to the average investor through its innovative QUBE tokens. This platform is changing the game by allowing anyone to grab a piece of the AI pie, previously a feast for the Silicon Valley bigwigs only. By making fractional investment a thing of reality, InQubeta is breaking open the door that has always kept retail on the sidelines. The real kicker? InQubeta utilizes NFTs to offer shares in these AI companies, making investment outcomes transparent and directly related to their success. This not only enriches the investment landscape but also weaves a closer bond between investors and the tech pioneers driving these projects. InQubeta\u2019s vision doesn\u2019t stop there. With a roadmap that dreams big \u2013 launching an NFT marketplace, rolling out the InQubeta swap, and firing up a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) \u2013 it\u2019s clear they\u2019re leading the march towards a future where AI and blockchain not just meet but meld in exciting ways. Backed by a thorough audit and a presale buzz that\u2019s already drawing in the millions, InQubeta\u2019s journey towards cross-chain expansion in 2024 is not just promising; it\u2019s practically in motion. Conclusion As Dogecoin dances its way towards the coveted $1 mark, fueled by a lively community and its irresistible meme magic, InQubeta is carving out its own place in the crypto world with something totally different. Very few initiatives are targeted towards making the investment game easy for average investors with small capital. However, with InQubeta, one can expect to be a part of a circle where the big investors take a chance. But as always, doing your homework is essential before deciding on the best crypto investments.

The presale of Rebel Satoshi\u2019s new token, $RECQ, has been growing at a significant rate. This growth has occurred even as many top crypto coins, such as Injective (INJ) and Terra Classic (LUNC), have been struggling. Let\u2019s delve into why $RECQ has left the top altcoins like INJ and LUNC behind, and why several analysts are describing it as the best crypto to buy right now. Rebel Satoshi nears 75% completion of stage 1 of the $RECQ presale The innovative meme coin project Rebel Satoshi is built on the Ethereum network. Inspired by Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto, Rebel Satoshi aims to bring a community-driven revolution. Rebel Satoshi aims to challenge the centralized financial institutions and take back control from the elites. The Rebel Satoshi ecosystem includes an NFT Vault, staking pools, a merchandise store, and a gaming Arcade. The entire Rebel Satoshi ecosystem is built on its dual-token system of the $RBLZ and the $RECQ tokens. Rebel Satoshi aims to grow to a $100 million market cap. Also, the presale of the $RBLZ token generated 150% returns and raised over $2.5 million for its investors. Right now, Rebel Satoshi is conducting the presale of the $RECQ tokens at $0.0037 per token in Stage 1. The $RECQ token has rallied by 85% to reach the current price, and over 74% of tokens have already been sold out. By the end of the presale, the $RECQ token is forecast to surge by 238% to $0.0125. That\u2019s why some analysts are describing the $RECQ token as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Injective continues to trade in red after rising to an all-time high The Injective (INJ) token has been one of the best performers in the recent market surge. As a result, the Injective price rose to an all-time high of $52.75 on March 13. Since then, the INJ token has been on a downtrend. As of the second week of April, the INJ price dropped by 34.6% to trade at around $34.45. Amid the price drop, the Injective (INJ) ecosystem has continued to grow exponentially. For instance, the Ionic Upgrade to the Injective Bridge was announced on March 26. The first DePin platform on Injective (INJ), Aurora, was introduced on April 7. These developments and others in the Injective ecosystem have led to a bullish outlook. Experts predict that the INJ token could rise above $40 again in the coming months. Terra Classic trades sideways after getting caught in market volatility The Terra Classic (LUNC) token has been caught up in volatility ever since rising in March. Initially, the LUNC token price dropped to $0.000121 on March 19 before bouncing slightly. The Terra Classic price then rose by 41.3% to $0.000171 a week later before dipping again. Since then, the Terra Classic (LUNC) has entered a downtrend, dipping by 20.4% to around the $0.000136 level. This drop in LUNC price has occurred despite Binance burning 4.1 billion LUNC on April 2. As the massive token burn has failed to turn the Terra Classic token bullish, experts are increasingly bearish on it. Hence, many are predicting that the Terra Classic (LUNC) will drop below $0.000120 in the coming months.

NuggetRush token emerges as a promising altcoin with play-to-earn gaming features. Cardano prioritizes security and scalability for smart contracts, while Ethereum faces technical challenges but maintains its commitment to decentralization. Amidst a recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have demonstrated signs of steadiness, as both assets have seen remarkable increases in value. At the same time, some analysts are shifting their attention to NuggetRush (NUGX), assessing its potential to become the next altcoin sensation. This digital asset offers innovative features and potential for growth in the crypto community. NuggetRush is among the bullish altcoins incorporating a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming design, allowing participants to earn tangible assets as prizes. Its innovative offerings strive to foster an engaging gaming atmosphere, attracting investors and gaming enthusiasts alike. The blockchain ICO presale is gaining momentum and piquing crypto investors\u2019 interest. This article explores why Ethereum and Cardano show remarkable gains as analysts eye NUGX tokens as the next altcoin sensations. NuggetRush (NUGX): decentralized GameFi exploration and real-world rewards NuggetRush is a new DeFi project fostering a vibrant community within a flourishing digital ecosystem focused on GameFi exploration. Operating on the Ethereum blockchain, NuggetRush prioritizes broad user accessibility. NUGX captures attention through blending exploration, strategic thinking, and tangible real-world benefits. Analysts suggest it may be one of the bullish altcoins poised for significant gains this year. The platform presents diverse avenues for gamers to accumulate rewards, including acquiring unique character NFTs, earning RUSHGEMS, and trading in-game assets. NuggetRush differentiates itself from typical meme coins by enabling players to trade their in-game earnings outside the platform\u2019s ecosystem. This new DeFi project has also established a player-driven marketplace for character NFTs and other exclusive items. This enriches the platform\u2019s economy and empowers users to exchange and sell virtual assets. NuggetRush has already garnered immense support, with over 271 million tokens sold and more than $3.75 million raised. Some industry analysts are predicting that once NUGX is listed on major exchanges, its price could experience a significant surge, potentially reaching $0.020. This anticipated price increase could position NUGX as one of the best crypto investment options right now. The NuggetRush vesting system presents an appealing incentive for early adopters. Through participation in the presale phase, investors can access up to 50% of the tokens across five claim rounds based on their entry timing. This mechanism could enable early supporters to realize substantial gains as the project progresses. Cardano (ADA): scalable ecosystem for smart contracts and DApps Cardano is a decentralized platform that creates a more secure and scalable infrastructure for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Cardano is trading at approximately $0.5877, showing stability amidst market fluctuations. As the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event approaches, alternative coins like Cardano are garnering attention. ADA showcases resilience and growth potential amid market volatility. This has piqued the interest of investors and traders seeking promising alternatives within the cryptocurrency landscape. Cardano has seen a remarkable turnaround in investor sentiment. After facing outflows, there\u2019s now a substantial $1.1 million inflow into ADA investment products. This shift highlights Cardano\u2019s resurgence and growing appeal among crypto investors. The influx of funds indicates a renewed confidence in Cardano\u2019s potential, marking a positive trend after a period of uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH): empowering decentralization with smart contracts Ethereum is a blockchain network that is decentralized and open-source, with the ability to execute smart contracts. The current price of Ethereum is approximately $3,315, which represents an increase of nearly 2%. After a significant upward trend from the $3,500 support level, ETH is now facing resistance around $3,550 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA). The hourly ETH/USD chart reveals a notable resistance zone at $3,550. Technical indicators indicate that the hourly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains bullish for ETH. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits below the 50 level, suggesting potential increased selling pressure. Despite recent challenges, Ethereum\u2019s repeated tests of crucial support levels hint at the possibility of a rapid price recovery. Conclusion As Ethereum and Cardano continue demonstrating remarkable gains in the cryptocurrency market, analysts are now setting their sights on the NuggetRush token as the next potential altcoin sensation. NuggetRush is an intriguing platform that combines gaming with decentralized finance principles. Its unique approach presents an attractive investment prospect for those interested in the growing GameFi industry. With growing excitement surrounding NUGX\u2019s listing on major exchanges and the continued development of its ecosystem, this token\u2019s future appears promising. It has the potential to create ripples within the ever-changing cryptocurrency world. For more information on NUGX, visit NuggetRush Presale Website.

Bitbot (BITBOT) is nearing the $2.3 million mark in presale amid investor interest. Bitcoin is trading up, currently green as price hovers above $70,900. The leading cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to break out to a new all-time high has received a new boost as reports emerge Hong Kong is set to approve its first spot Bitcoin ETFs. BTC\u2019s upside flip is likely to push other altcoins higher, and one of the new tokens attracting the most attention is Bitbot (BITBOT). Is Bitcoin (BTC) set to explode next week? There are reports that Hong Kong could approve the first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the region as early as Monday. A Bloomberg report on Friday quotes sources as saying that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is set to give it nod, just days after major Chinese funds applied to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs. While Hong Kong\u2019s decision is not officially communicated as of writing, there\u2019s growing positivity in the market already. In January 2024, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, the price of BTC skyrocketed amid massive demand. BTC reached its ATH of $73,737 in March, riding halving and spot ETFs sentiment. The SEC has called for public participation on spot ETH ETFs. Today\u2019s news has seen the bellwether crypto flip from lows of $69,500 to currently trade above $70,900. Ethereum has also gained slightly, currently hovering above $3,520. Should the ETFs draw inflows as witnessed with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and others, there\u2019s potential for BTC, ETH and other coins to rally in coming weeks. Also likely to attract investor are new tokens that could tap into the overall market strength and specific fundamentals to emerge as top performers in the market in 2024 and beyond. Bitbot: Pioneering non-custodial trading bot on Telegram BitBot is the pioneering non-custodial crypto trading bot, poised to enter the crypto market at a time traders are keen on available opportunities. While competing Telegram trading bots are custodial solutions \u2013 that is they control users\u2019 private keys and thus hold their assets \u2013 Bitbot takes the approach of \u2018not your keys, not your assets.\u201d In short, Bitbot is where a Telegram bot user has the full control of their private keys and wallet. Security is key to crypto traders, who unfortunately have had to learn the hard way given incidents involving top bots such as Unibot and Banana Gun. By focusing on security through its partnership with Knightsafe, Bitbot has taken an early lead against potential rival trading apps. Bitbot app\u2019s AI capabilities add to the superior outlook, with users able to access all the advanced institutional-grade trading tools that make trading via bots such a huge market in the crypto space. Bitbot offers all of these, including trade sniping, gem scanner, copy trading and automated execution, without compromising on user security and convenience. Bitbot presale surpasses $2.2 million amid investor interest The native BITBOT token is in presale and users will get access to benefits such as revenue-sharing, trading discounts and airdrops. Presale participants can buy BITBOT at the still heavily discounted price of $0.0155 in stage 10. Early bird investors have pushed the presale to near $2.3 million. Notably, there\u2019s just five stages to go before Bitbot hits the final stage 15 and tokens debut in the market. This could be at a time when Bitcoin and Ethereum are in parabolic mode. That means current presale prices could be a real bargain and opportunity. To learn more visit the Bitbot website.

The appointments of Jorn Lambert, Raj Seshadri, and Craig Vosburg to newly defined C-suite roles highlight Mastercard's focus on three key areas: core payments, commercial expansion, and data-driven services. This strategic realignment could position Mastercard to compete more effectively in a rapidly evolving payments industry. Doubling Down on Core Payments: Jorn Lambert's move to Chief Product Officer signifies the continued importance of Mastercard's traditional business \u2013 facilitating secure and efficient card transactions. This focus ensures they stay competitive against rivals like Visa and emerging players in the global payments network. Expanding the Commercial Landscape: Raj Seshadri's appointment as Chief Commercial Payments Officer reflects Mastercard's ambition to broaden its reach beyond consumer credit cards. By placing a dedicated leader in charge of B2B payments, bill payments, and remittances, Mastercard signals its intent to capture a larger share of the commercial payments market. This focus on business-to-business transactions could be a significant growth driver in the coming years. Data and AI Take Center Stage: The creation of a new data and AI organization under Craig Vosburg, the Chief Services Officer, is a strong indicator of Mastercard's strategic direction. By placing data and AI at the heart of its service offerings, Mastercard is well-positioned to leverage its vast transaction data to provide valuable insights and solutions for its partners and customers. This focus on data-driven services could unlock new revenue streams and differentiate Mastercard in a crowded marketplace. Mastercard's Long Game: CEO Michael Miebach's comments about \"long-term growth\" and \"diversifying revenue streams\" suggest Mastercard is playing the long game. The leadership changes and corporate restructuring aim to position the company for sustained success in a dynamic financial environment. Whether this strategic shift proves successful remains to be seen, but Mastercard's focus on core payments, commercial expansion, and data-driven services provides a clear roadmap for the future. Open Questions: While the realignment appears well-defined, some questions remain. How will Mastercard balance its traditional focus on consumer payments with its push into the commercial space? Can the company successfully integrate data and AI into its services to create real value for its customers? The answers to these questions will ultimately determine the success of Mastercard's strategic vision. One thing is certain: Mastercard is making a bold move.

In the heart of India's digital payment revolution, a battleground is emerging \u2013 the war of the wallets. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent decision to allow third-party UPI apps to access prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) has ignited a firestorm of potential, and the fight for customer loyalty is about to get fierce. This isn't your typical corporate clash. The combatants here are a diverse bunch \u2013 established giants like Paytm, scrappy fintech startups, and even brick-and-mortar retailers with their own loyalty programs. Until now, PPIs operated in closed gardens, forcing users to stick to the app provided by the issuer. This fragmented landscape stifled competition and limited the reach of digital payments, especially for smaller transactions. The RBI's move dismantles these walls, throwing the doors wide open for innovation. It's much like your local coffee shop's loyalty card morphing into your go-to payment method for online shopping. Or a small business owner seamlessly integrating their existing PPI system with a user-friendly UPI app, attracting a wider customer base. Suddenly, the possibilities for seamless and convenient digital payments explode. This isn't just about convenience, it's about power. The dominance of giants like Paytm, with its staggering $19.1 billion GMV in FY23, is under threat. Smaller players now have a fighting chance, offering unique features and experiences to woo users. Competition breeds choice, and consumers stand to benefit with a wider array of options and potentially lower fees. But the real prize lies in financial inclusion. By removing the restriction to a single app, the RBI is making digital payments more accessible for millions. Small businesses, often reliant on cash transactions, can now tap into the digital ecosystem with ease. Individuals new to the digital realm no longer face the hurdle of navigating a specific PPI issuer's app. This inclusivity can be a game-changer, driving financial empowerment and propelling India's ambition to become a digital payments powerhouse. However, the war won't be won without casualties. Security concerns need to be addressed to ensure a safe environment for transactions across different platforms. User experience will also be a battleground \u2013 clunky interfaces and a lack of interoperability can quickly turn customers away. The RBI's decision is a bold move, but the true test lies in execution. Can India create a robust infrastructure that fosters healthy competition while prioritizing security and user experience? The answer will determine the victor in the war of the wallets, but the ultimate winner will be India itself, paving the way for a future where digital payments become the norm, not the exception. This disruption has the potential to not just reshape India's financial landscape, but act as a blueprint for other developing economies looking to embrace the future of money. The war drums are beating, and the world is watching. The Great Wallet War has just begun.

Forget quaint cafes and charming cobblestone streets; the real buzz surrounds something far more disruptive: cryptocurrency. This once fringe technology is shedding its shadowy reputation and stepping into the bright lights of everyday transactions, not just in Lugano, but with the potential to transform our global financial landscape. Lugano isn't just dipping its toes in the crypto pool; it's diving headfirst. The city has embraced cryptocurrencies like a long-lost friend, allowing residents to pay for everything from lattes to taxes using digital tokens. This isn't some pilot program cobbled together with duct tape and optimism. Lugano has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to create a robust infrastructure that supports payments in Bitcoin, Tether, and even their very own local token, LVGA. The early results are promising \u2013 over 15% of Lugano's citizens have already incorporated crypto into their daily routines. But why Lugano? Why now? The answer lies in a perfect storm of necessity and opportunity. Switzerland, with its reputation for innovation and a progressive approach to finance, provided fertile ground for the seeds of crypto adoption to take root. Lugano, a city eager to boost its economy and attract new residents, saw crypto as a golden ticket. By embracing this new financial frontier, they've positioned themselves at the forefront of a movement that could redefine how we pay for everything. Convenience, the cornerstone of successful payment methods, is a hurdle crypto needs to clear. While tech-savvy early adopters scoff at the clunky interfaces and slow transaction times of traditional banking, the average citizen craves a seamless experience. Lugano's success hinges on making crypto as effortless to use as swiping a debit card. Here, the city's partnership with Bitfinex proves crucial. The exchange has developed a user-friendly platform that streamlines payments, allowing residents to pay with a simple QR code scan. This eliminates the complexities often associated with crypto transactions, making it a more palatable option for the everyday user. The fear of the unknown is another hurdle crypto must overcome. Decentralized currencies, free from the oversight of traditional financial institutions, can feel unsettling to some. Lugano's approach directly addresses this concern. By partnering with a reputable exchange like Bitfinex, they've instilled a sense of trust and legitimacy in the system. Residents know their hard-earned crypto is in safe hands, paving the way for wider acceptance. Of course, Lugano isn't the only place where crypto is making inroads into the mainstream. Crypto credit cards are gaining traction, allowing users to spend their digital currency at any store that accepts traditional cards. Forward-thinking companies like Microsoft and even Wikipedia are now welcoming Bitcoin payments. These baby steps, coupled with the success story unfolding in Lugano, paint a compelling picture of a future where crypto becomes a familiar face at the checkout counter. But crypto's ascent to financial stardom won't be without its share of drama. Regulation, the bane of many an innovation's existence, will undoubtedly play a role. Governments will grapple with how to integrate this disruptive technology into the existing financial framework. Finding the right balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers will be a delicate dance. The road ahead for crypto is paved with both promise and peril. Challenges abound, but the potential rewards are undeniable. Cities like Lugano are proving that crypto can be more than just a speculative asset class; it can become a practical tool that transforms how we manage our money. As crypto sheds its cloak of obscurity and ventures into the public square, one thing is certain: the way we pay for our daily lives is on the cusp of a fascinating metamorphosis. Lugano may be the stage for the opening act, but the global financial drama is just beginning.

The country\u2019s financial market regulator successfully obtained a court order to appoint receivers for the digital currency assets held by a group of three crypto mining companies, collectively known as NGS Companies, and their sole directors. Bust of a Crypto Investment Scheme The court order, issued on Wednesday, was part of the civil proceedings initiated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) against NGS Crypto Pty Ltd, NGS Digital Pty Ltd, and NGS Group Ltd, along with their respective sole directors Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten. Additionally, the court has restricted Mendham from traveling outside Australia. NGS Companies offered investment packages supported by their cryptocurrency mining activities. These packages guaranteed fixed-rate returns as high as 16 percent annually, according to the company's website, with a minimum fixed return promised at 6 percent. The regulator highlighted that the schemes particularly encouraged investors to transfer funds from regulated superannuation funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs), which were then converted into cryptocurrency. The promotional material on the company\u2019s website, including \u201ctestimonials\u201d and \u201cstories,\u201d seemed to specifically target elderly investors.

The country\u2019s financial market regulator successfully obtained a court order to appoint receivers for the digital currency assets held by a group of three crypto mining companies, collectively known as NGS Companies, and their sole directors. Bust of a Crypto Investment Scheme The court order, issued on Wednesday, was part of the civil proceedings initiated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) against NGS Crypto Pty Ltd, NGS Digital Pty Ltd, and NGS Group Ltd, along with their respective sole directors Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten. Additionally, the court has restricted Mendham from traveling outside Australia. NGS Companies offered investment packages supported by their cryptocurrency mining activities. These packages guaranteed fixed-rate returns as high as 16 percent annually, according to the company's website, with a minimum fixed return promised at 6 percent. The regulator highlighted that the schemes particularly encouraged investors to transfer funds from regulated superannuation funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs), which were then converted into cryptocurrency. The promotional material on the company\u2019s website, including \u201ctestimonials\u201d and \u201cstories,\u201d seemed to specifically target elderly investors.

The appeal was filed just hours before the deadline. SBF Appealed Earlier, the judge had ordered Bankman-Fried to be remanded to a low or medium-security prison in Northern California. This facility is near his parents\u2019 house, and the judge cited concerns for his security at a maximum-security prison due to his autism. Interestingly, during his trial and while awaiting sentencing, Bankman-Fried had requested to be kept in the notorious Manhattan Detention Center. Previously, he was an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The appeal came two weeks after a US court sentenced him to 25 years in prison, along with three years of supervised release. He is also required to forfeit $11 billion. Billionaire to Convict Bankman-Fried was once regarded as the messiah of the cryptocurrency world, known for his altruistic vision, signature T-shirt, and shorts outfit. He became one of the youngest self-made billionaires through his FTX empire, which collapsed overnight following the discovery of his dubious business practices. After a high-profile trial, Bankman-Fried was convicted last November on multiple charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Although the total maximum prison time for all the convictions could amount to 115 years, the prosecutors were seeking 40 to 50 years. Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team requested six-and-a-half years, but the court ultimately sentenced him to 25 years. During the trial, several close associates of Bankman-Fried testified against him.

The online frontier, however, seems content with pronouncements, leaving the digital equivalent of tumbleweeds \u2013 authorized push payment (APP) fraud \u2013 to roll unchecked. Until now. New regulations in the UK aim to be the posse riding into town, but will they be enough to truly corral this cyber cattle rustle? APP fraud thrives on a simple deception: tricking victims into authorizing payments to fraudsters. It's a confidence trick for the digital age, and just like their historical counterparts, these online swindlers prey on trust and exploit vulnerabilities. The fallout, however, transcends the individual. It erodes confidence in the very systems that underpin our digital interactions. The UK's new regulations are a response to this erosion. Previously, a voluntary code offered some protection, but it was akin to a town marshal with a single-shot derringer \u2013 limited in scope and effectiveness. The new rules, coming into effect this October, are a legislative six-shooter. They mandate reimbursement for victims of APP fraud, placing the onus on payment service providers (PSPs) to act as digital sheriffs, responsible for identifying and stopping the heist before it happens, or reimbursing the victim if they fail. This shift in responsibility is significant. Previously, the onus often fell on the victim to prove they weren't somehow complicit in their own defrauding, much like in a Wild West scenario where the bank, upon discovering a stolen sack of gold, demanded the depositor explain why they weren't more vigilant in guarding it. The new regulations dismantle this skewed logic. They recognize the inherent power imbalance between a sophisticated fraudster and an unsuspecting victim navigating the complexities of online transactions. The success of these regulations hinges on two key factors: robust fraud detection by PSPs and a clear definition of \"consumer standard of caution.\" The former demands a proactive approach from PSPs. Gone are the days of reactive measures \u2013 deploying technology and human expertise to identify and flag suspicious transactions before the money leaves the victim's account. The latter, the \"consumer standard of caution,\" is a delicate dance. It must be stringent enough to deter negligence while remaining flexible enough to acknowledge the realities of human fallibility, particularly when dealing with vulnerable customers. The UK's approach isn't a silver bullet. Just as the Wild West still had its share of outlaws after the sheriffs arrived, online fraudsters will undoubtedly adapt their tactics. However, these regulations represent a critical step forward. They move the conversation from victim-blaming to proactive security. They incentivize PSPs to invest in robust defenses, ultimately fostering a more secure online ecosystem for everyone. This isn't just a UK story. The rise of APP fraud is a global phenomenon. The UK's approach serves as a test case, a potential model for other countries grappling with the same issue. Will it be enough? Only time will tell.

But new on-ramps are emerging and Open Banking, a seemingly uncharted road, is promising a more direct and potentially more efficient journey. Open Banking, much like a high-speed rail system bypassing congested tollbooths, facilitates Account-to-Account (A2A) payments. Consumers can transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to a merchant's account, bypassing the card networks and their associated fees. This holds the potential for a smoother ride for both merchants, who can potentially reduce their transaction costs, and consumers, who may benefit from lower prices or special A2A-only discounts. However, the American consumer, comfortable in their high-occupancy vehicles (credit cards) and accustomed to the familiar rewards program exits, may not be easily persuaded to switch lanes. Insights from the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024: Sponsored by the World Bank and other key players, the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024 highlights the growing popularity of A2A payments. Back in 2022, only half of the jury members predicted A2A networks and mobile money would compete with cards within five years. However, just two years later, the picture has changed dramatically. Over two-thirds of jurors now believe A2A and mobile money will be the fastest-growing retail payment methods in their home markets. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Global South (Africa, Middle East, South America, Asia Pacific), where card networks haven't established a dominant position. Here, only 13% see cards holding sway, while 54% predict A2A or mobile money taking the lead. Existing examples like Brazil's PIX, which surpassed credit and debit card market share in 2023, showcase this trend's potency. The Global North presents a more nuanced picture. Here, expert opinions are divided between cards and the A2A/mobile money combination. While A2A payments have gained traction in Europe (Poland's Blik, Netherlands' IDEAL, Sweden's Swish), some experts believe cards will retain dominance. However, a third of jurors foresee ongoing competition with no clear winner. The Driving Forces: Several factors are fueling the rise of A2A payments: Open Banking: Open Banking regulations allow third-party providers to access customer financial data with consent, facilitating A2A transactions. Instant Payments: The rise of instant payment networks enables faster and more efficient A2A transfers. Strong Authentication: Improved authentication methods enhance security and consumer trust in A2A transactions. Potential Benefits: Lower Transaction Costs: A2A payments generally involve lower fees compared to card transactions, potentially benefiting both businesses and consumers. Improved Customer Journeys: Streamlined checkout processes and in-app payments can enhance the customer experience. Greater Consumer Choice: A2A payments offer consumers an alternative to traditional payment methods, fostering competition and innovation. Industry Response: The rise of A2A has spurred action from key players. Even in North America, where cards reign supreme, companies are taking notice. McKinsey highlights the potential for A2A to offer banks a \"more competitive way of making payments\" while providing consumers and merchants with more options. Visa and Mastercard are investing in A2A plays, and TrueLayer's new A2A payments app allows merchants to integrate A2A options into their checkout processes. Conclusion: Open Banking and A2A payments represent a significant shift in the global payments landscape. While the pace of adoption may differ across regions, the potential for A2A to become a mainstream payment method is undeniable. As the technology matures and consumer trust grows, A2A payments have the potential to revolutionize the way we pay, fostering a more transparent, efficient, and rewarding financial ecosystem. Yet, the revolution faces a more significant obstacle: the inertia of established infrastructure. Change, particularly when it involves money, is often met with resistance. Drivers, accustomed to the ease of swiping plastic, may be hesitant to navigate a new and potentially unfamiliar road system as it would be like asking drivers to switch from their favorite, well-lit highway to a less-traveled backroad \u2013 a more direct route, perhaps, but lacking the familiar rest stops and roadside attractions. The battle for the future of payments in America is not a race to a single destination, but a reimagining of the entire transportation network. Consumers, enticed by the promise of a more personalized and potentially cheaper experience, could become the loyal riders. But the established card networks, the seasoned highway authorities of the financial landscape, will not relinquish their control easily. They will unleash their marketing campaigns, wielding the glittering lure of rewards points as a well-advertised scenic byway. The outcome of this digital revolution remains unwritten. Will Open Banking and A2A payments become the preferred route for American consumers, ushering in an era of financial transparency and lower costs? Or will the inertia of the status quo and the allure of plastic's rewards prevail? Only one thing is certain: consumers are holding the steering wheel. Will they remain content with the familiar highway, or will they embrace the new on-ramp and become active participants in a financial revolution? Only time will tell who will reach their destination first in this high-stakes race for payment supremacy. This article was written by Pedro Ferreira at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"American consumers, accustomed to cruising down the well-paved highway of credit card payments, enjoy a smooth ride filled with loyalty program points and convenient one-click purchases. But new on-ramps are emerging and Open Banking, a seemingly uncharted road, is promising a more direct and potentially more efficient journey. Open Banking, much like a high-speed rail system bypassing congested tollbooths, facilitates Account-to-Account (A2A) payments. Consumers can transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to a merchant's account, bypassing the card networks and their associated fees. This holds the potential for a smoother ride for both merchants, who can potentially reduce their transaction costs, and consumers, who may benefit from lower prices or special A2A-only discounts. However, the American consumer, comfortable in their high-occupancy vehicles (credit cards) and accustomed to the familiar rewards program exits, may not be easily persuaded to switch lanes. Insights from the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024: Sponsored by the World Bank and other key players, the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024 highlights the growing popularity of A2A payments. Back in 2022, only half of the jury members predicted A2A networks and mobile money would compete with cards within five years. However, just two years later, the picture has changed dramatically. Over two-thirds of jurors now believe A2A and mobile money will be the fastest-growing retail payment methods in their home markets. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Global South (Africa, Middle East, South America, Asia Pacific), where card networks haven't established a dominant position.

For retail and institutional investors alike, questions of regulatory and tax compliance can be puzzling. Then, there\u2019s the challenge of learning to navigate a new ecosystem. Using exchanges, sending transactions, and taking custody of coins can take significant time to learn. Fortunately, there are ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin without purchasing and holding the asset itself. This can be done in a standard brokerage or retirement account. This article will explore the avenues available for tapping into the Bitcoin market in this way, including exchange-traded Funds (ETFs), public companies with Bitcoin holdings, and mining companies. Bitcoin ETFs: A Gateway to Cryptocurrency Markets ETFs in general have become a popular vehicle for investors looking to diversify their portfolios without directly purchasing the underlying assets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a straightforward way to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated framework, and have been very successful since their initial launch in the US on January 10, 2024. The first gold ETF took 2 years to reach $10 billion in AUM. Blackrock\u2019s IBIT accomplished the same in just 2 months. Investors track the price of Bitcoin and trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing liquidity and accessibility to investors who may not otherwise be able to access cryptocurrency markets or don\u2019t want to hold Bitcoin itself. Some of the most dominant spot ETFs in the US include BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, and ARK\u2019s 21 Bitcoin Shares. Here are some important things to think about when it comes to selecting a spot Bitcoin ETF: Custodian: How does the issuer store their coins? All the ETFs use Coinbase as their custodians, with a few exceptions: Fidelity secures their own Bitcoin internally, VanEck uses BitGo rather than Coinbase, Hashdex selected BitGo as its custodian. Fees: What expense ratio does the fund charge? BitWise has garnered attention for having the lowest fee at just twenty basis points. On the other end of the spectrum, Grayscale charges 1.5%. Transparency: How much do you value transparency when it comes to your funds\u2019 holdings? So far, BitWise is the only fund that has published the public key to its wallet, allowing anyone to view the blockchain transactions that prove the fund holds what it claims to. Fidelity stands out, as being a veteran in the digital asset space that allows them to self-custody their Bitcoin holdings. BitWise shines for its low fees and transparency. Some investors see these funds as preferable. Others may opt for the reputation of firms like BlackRock or ARK. Public Companies with Bitcoin Holdings: Investing in Corporate Believers A number of forward-thinking public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, recognizing its potential as a store of value. By investing in these companies, investors indirectly gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. This approach allows investors to benefit from the company's broader business performance while aligning with their innovative stance on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy (MSTR) was the first and still is the most well-known company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company currently holds over 1% of the entire supply of BTC. Shares of MSTR have also seen impressive appreciation in recent years, even outperforming Bitcoin at times. Here is a partial list of other companies that have decided to put Bitcoin on their balance sheets: Coinbase Galaxy Digital Holdings Marathon Digital Holdings Block Tesla In addition to companies that hold Bitcoin, mining stocks can also provide BTC exposure.

Investing in these companies represents an investment in the infrastructure of the Bitcoin network. As the demand for Bitcoin grows, these companies may see increased profitability, making them an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the cryptocurrency space. The recent rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price has been accompanied by an increase in the network\u2019s hash rate, as miners can create profitable operations with greater ease. Many mining companies hold some of the Bitcoin they mine on their balance sheets, making them a way to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and its infrastructure. A few popular Bitcoin mining stocks in 2024 include: Hut8 Riot Blockchain Hive Blockchain Bitfarms Limited Cipher Mining CleanSpark CRYPTO BREAKING NEWSThe Bitcoin ETFs Help Money Flow Into Smaller Projects And Their ICOs.

For example, mining stocks can be very volatile, even more so than Bitcoin. Yet they can outperform Bitcoin by a significant margin at times. Such securities require the highest risk tolerance and greatest conviction in the promise of Bitcoin. They can be thought of as a speculative play on Bitcoin, which may be too speculative for some. Public companies that hold Bitcoin provide a blend of exposure to the company\u2019s operations and their Bitcoin holdings. In general, the larger the Bitcoin holdings, the more the share price tends to be correlated to the Bitcoin price. These can be a great choice for more traditional investors who feel safer holding equities with earnings, cashflows, dividends, etc. The downside is they may underperform the other securities available. Bitcoin ETFs represent the purest Bitcoin exposure that a brokerage account can have. There\u2019s not much to be said here, as these shares represent ownership of a portion of the fund\u2019s BTC holdings. There has even been talk of ETFs eventually allowing shares to be redeemed for spot Bitcoin, although this is unlikely in the USA, as the SEC has required ETFs to be settled in cash only. The drawback is that each ETF issuer charges fees, which can eat into profits over time. When considering exposure to Bitcoin through your brokerage account, it's important to evaluate your investment goals and risk tolerance. Bitcoin and related investments can be volatile, and a strategic approach should involve due diligence and a clear understanding of the underlying market dynamics.
