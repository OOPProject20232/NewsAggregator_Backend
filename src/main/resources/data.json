The price structure of ICON shows a fierce battle, with bulls initially dominating the price and holding the upper hand as the price jumped from $0.1500 to $0.4000. Nevertheless, bears disrupted the market on March 14th, 2024, leading to a loss of momentum for the bulls. Therefore, bears dominated and set new lower lows and highs on the daily chart, leading to the formation of support at $0.2000. After that, the price consolidated at this critical level for a couple of daily sessions. The latest price indicates a spike from the support base at $0.2000 by April 20th and illustrates a minor pushback from bears, possibly signaling a return of bullish momentum. Furthermore, the ICON crypto price approaches the primary resistance levels from the 20-day and 50-day EMAs on the daily asset chart. Meanwhile, RSI is at 45.96 and has taken support on 14-SMA, and MACD is at -0.184 with a bullish cross. At the time of writing, the ICON price has increased by +4.37% since yesterday and was $0.2606 at press time. If demand for ICX increases, it may rebound remarkably from its present price level. The next target for the price may be to hit $0.3000; beyond this price level, it could stretch up to $0.3400. Conversely, if the ICX crypto price asset drops below the $0.2000 threshold support, it may continue to fall and reach lower points in the coming sessions. ICON Crypto Volatility, Volume, And Price This chart contrasts the volume volatility and the ICON crypto price movement. ICX crypto volume is increasing gradually, and positivity has been witnessed in recent sessions. However, the volatility has declined from 0.159 to 0.042, indicating stability. Moreover, the ICX crypto seems comfortable at the current price levels, which shows that the sellers are sitting in the rear, and the bulls may assist the ICON crypto price rise. ICON Crypto Development Activity And Count Analysis The ICX crypto allows tracking weekly developer activity and focusing on healthy activity. This is further achieved by monitoring the developers\u2019 contribution to the commit count in ICON. The development peaked in January 2024 and fell to mid-April 2024; by April 16th, 2024, the activity count had started increasing. This scenario highlights that the ICON crypto has seen significant developer activity and commit count over the last three months. Similarly, this information can be used to make informed decisions about the future of ICX crypto and its development. ICON Crypto Social Activity The level of social dominance sentiment indicates the level of acceptance of ICON crypto among users, increasing or decreasing. The social dominance chart shows a favorable trend over time. The level of social activity around ICX cryptocurrency appears to have increased in the latest trading sessions due to the rising price. It shows a continuation of the current short-term trend, increased social volume, and a growing awareness about ICON cryptocurrency. The rise in social dominance could also lead to an increase in the price of ICON, as more user involvement may boost demand and increase the ICX asset\u2019s value. Summary The price of ICON faced a fierce battle between bulls and bears, leading to a jump from $0.1500 to $0.4000, followed by a drop to $0.2000. Currently, at $0.2606, it may rise to $0.3000 or fall below $0.2000, depending on demand.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is collaborating with Google and Apple to eliminate applications managed by Binance, a cryptocurrency giant, from app marketplaces in the Philippines. SEC\u2019s Letter To Binance On April 19, the SEC sent separate letters to both Google and Apple requesting the removal of the Binance-controlled applications from the Google Play and Apple App Store. The SEC has identified Binance and concluded that continued public access to these websites/apps threatens the security of the funds of investing Filipinos. In a letter, the Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Emilio B. Aquino, indicated that the act of selling or offering unregistered securities to Filipinos, as well as operating as an unregistered broker, violates Republic Act no. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code. Mr. Aquino emphasized that removing and blocking Binance\u2019s applications would help prevent the further spread of its illegal activities in the country, which could negatively impact the economy. This action aims to safeguard the investing public from any potential harm. The request from the SEC and the National Telecommunications Commission to block access to websites used by Binance in the country followed this. SEC\u2019s Warning The SEC warned the public against investing in and using Binance. It began studying the possible blocking of Binance\u2019s website and other online presence in the Philippines as early as November 2023. Binance is a large crypto trading platform with over 183 million members, trading more than 402 cryptocurrencies daily. However, it needs the necessary license to operate an exchange for buying and selling securities, as the law requires. The SEC advises Filipino investors to close their positions or transfer their crypto holdings to duly registered providers. However, the SEC has yet to secure a license for Binance to solicit investments from the public or operate an exchange to buy and sell securities. The Problem With Binance According To SEC Binance has been involved in various regulatory-related issues worldwide. In Canada, it is facing a new class-action lawsuit alleging that it violates local securities laws. At the same time, it has agreed to pay a $2 Million fine for previous non-compliance with local regulations in India. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency exchange has received its crypto license in Dubai, known as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), after Binance\u2019s co-founder gave up his voting power in the exchange\u2019s local entity. On April 8, an SEC official reiterated that they had already given users three months and an extension. It was done to facilitate the withdrawal of their funds from the exchange. After this period, the SEC said they could not endorse any methods for retrieving funds. Conclusion Google and Apple are removing Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency apps in the Philippines due to unregistered security sales violating local regulations. Binance has faced other regulatory issues globally. However, the cryptocurrency exchange received its crypto license in Dubai after Binance\u2019s co-founder forfeited his voting power in the exchange\u2019s local entity.

Hut 8, is looking to expand its self-mining operations and diversify its revenue streams to remain competitive in the post-halving market. Despite having a lower self-mining hash rate than its competitors, Benchmark expects Hut 8 to close the gap over time. The Report By Benchmark\u2019s Analyst Palmer cited Hut 8\u2019s multiple revenue streams, including self-mining, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence services, as justification for his price target. He also said that Hut 8\u2019s enterprise value-to-revenue multiple of 2.6 is slightly below the 3.1 average of its publicly traded Bitcoin mining peers, such as Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and others. Although Hut 8 still needs to upgrade its hash rate, Palmer said its 9,102 Bitcoin held on reserve provides it with a \u201csizable liquidity cushion\u201d and an ability to capture upside moves if the price of BTC were to rally significantly in the coming months. On February 7, Hut 8 announced a leadership shakeup, with Asher Genoot replacing former CEO Jamie Leverton. Hut 8 refuted the report, claiming it was filled with inaccurate information and misrepresented data. Hut 8 aims to increase its cash flow, reduce mining costs, and boost Bitcoin production by approximately 11% per EH by relocating efficient miners to its Medicine Hat site while retiring old and inefficient ones. Hut 8\u2019s diverse business operations may provide an advantage following the halving. Investors are currently showing interest in self-mining as they expect the price of bitcoin to increase significantly after the latest halving, according to a statement. Hut 8, which has a self-mining deployed hash rate of 5.4 exahash per second (EH/s), is lagging behind some of the largest players in the same category, including Marathon Digital, which had 27.8 EH/s of installed hash rate at the same time, the statement added. The statement also stated that Hut 8\u2019s diversified platform is likely to provide long-term benefits, as its revenue streams outside of self-mining put it in a better position to withstand severe downturns in bitcoin\u2019s price compared to most of its listed peers. Hut 8\u2019s merger with US Bitcoin Corp. in November, which created a combined company with 25.5 EH/s of hash rate and 884 MW of energy capacity under management, also has business lines focused on managed services, hosting, high-performance computing and AI, the statement added. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has been working on reducing costs and eliminating inefficiencies in all business lines. In a recent statement, the company announced it had energized a third of its 63 MW Salt Creek site in Culberson County, TX. It relocated miners from its Kearney, NE and Granbury, TX sites to that location. According to the statement, the company\u2019s holdings of 9,102 BTC \u2013 second in the mining segment to Marathon Digital \u2013 give it a solid liquidity cushion and the ability to capture upside during bitcoin price rallies. The statement also pointed out that Hut 8\u2019s mining fleet needs more efficiency upgrades. However, its diversified model and relative strength in bitcoin\u2019s price should support its operating performance until new equipment is purchased and deployed. Conclusion Hut 8 has received a buy rating from one of the investment banks. The company announced a leadership change after a report from JCapital claimed it was in legal trouble. Hut 8 denied the report. Investors are interested in self-mining as they expect the price of bitcoin to rise after the latest halving. Hut 8 lags behind Marathon Digital in installed hash rate.

Founders Share Their Views About Gaming Platforms Kieran Warwick, founder of gaming studio Illuvium, emphasized the effectiveness of such tactics in capturing market share. He stated in an interview with Cointelegraph, \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy way to get market share.\u201d However, Warwick also underscored the importance of prioritizing fun and gameplay quality in gaming experiences, asserting that games lacking in these aspects are destined to fail. Warwick said, \u201cThe problem with that is if you\u2019re using it as a marketing tool and you don\u2019t have a good product to back it up, then your retention is abysmal.\u201d Shi Khai Wei, founder of venture capital firm LongHash Ventures, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the critical role of enjoyment in gaming experiences. Despite the ability advantages of token incentives, Wei emphasized that sustainable economics and attractive gameplay are crucial for a recreation\u2019s fulfillment. Shi Khai Wei, \u201cCrypto is very good at acquiring users because of incentives \u2014 we have airdrops, play-to-earn mechanics and speculative elements, but to keep the players there, you need to have fun gameplay.\u201d Axie Infinity Shared Success Stories of Blockchain Games Axie Infinity stands as one of the most outstanding achievement memories inside the realm of blockchain video games. However, challenges such as a $650 Million bridge hack have posed hurdles for its creator firm, Sky Mavis, in retaining users\u2019 post-bear market. Wei said, \u201cGames that figure out sustainable economics, the right emission schedules, attracting the right kind of players and incentivizing the right kind of gameplay, those are the games that will survive.\u201d Wei emphasized the importance of implementing sustainable economics, attracting the right player demographic, and incentivizing enjoyable gameplay as key factors for a game\u2019s survival in the competitive gaming landscape. Idea To Make Money While Warwick acknowledged that token incentives may attract airdrop farmers rather than genuine gamers, he views them as a necessary tool for expanding the player base. He highlighted the attention garnered from individuals active in the gaming space as a positive outcome of token incentives. Warwick\u2019s perspective aligns with Illuvium\u2019s recent initiative, releasing 200,000 ILV tokens valued at approximately $25 Million for its Play-to-Airdrop program. Gabby Dizon, CEO of Yield Guild Games, emphasized the potential of airdrops to accelerate the adoption of GameFi (gaming decentralized finance). However, Dizon noted that financial returns may not be the primary motivation for all gamers. Despite being several years behind traditional gaming, Dizon and Warwick anticipate rapid progress in the GameFi sector, driven by blockchain\u2019s faster innovation rate compared to traditional gaming. Warwick highlighted the time-consuming process of building intellectual property (IP) in the gaming industry, noting that leading gaming studios are only halfway through this process. He emphasized the desire for persistence and highlighted the anticipation for a dominant GameFi assignment that would propel the sector ahead, corresponding to Clash of Clans and Candy Crush in the early 2010s. Yield Guild Games envisions a destiny in which blockchain games reach the same quality as traditional gaming giants, aiming to facilitate this progress through its decentralized network of gaming guilds. Despite uncertainties, Wei expressed confidence in the GameFi industry\u2019s potential, predicting the release of an AAA-standard game in 2024. In conclusion, while the integration of token incentives into gaming experiences may face skepticism from some gamers, industry executives believe that such strategies will persist as gaming studios strive to attract and retain players in the evolving landscape of GameFi.","article_summary":"Amidst ongoing debate among gamers regarding the incorporation of \u201ctokenomics\u201d into gaming experiences, industry executives predict that gaming studios will persist in utilizing airdrops and other incentives to attract players.

This decision mirrors a similar suspension of carriers carried out in British Columbia (BC), even though the processes taken by each province vary in their specifics. Extension of Manitoba Manitoba\u2019s extension of the pause relates to new requests from crypto miners and requests for electric-powered service, which have yet to result in the execution of agreements to assemble essential infrastructure. This pass reflects Manitoba\u2019s cautious stance on handling the burgeoning call for strength from cryptocurrency mining sports. The preliminary pause on electric connections to crypto-mining operations was instituted with the aid of the provincial government in November 2022, spanning 18 months. With the recent extension, the pause is slated to persist until April 30, 2026. During this time, the province intends to formulate a complete, long-term technique to address the demanding situations related to the growing call for electricity from cryptocurrency mining operations. It said in an announcement, \u201cManitoba Hydro continues to expect unprecedented demand for electricity from new or expanding cryptocurrency operations. That demand has the potential to drastically increase our total electrical load.\u201d Reason For Extension The choice to increase the moratorium became underpinned by issues over the pressure on Manitoba\u2019s electric infrastructure. Former CEO of Manitoba Hydro, Jay Grewal, highlighted the magnitude of the assignment in 2022, noting that connecting every cryptocurrency operator expressing hobby would bring about an astonishing growth of 4,600 megawatts in total electrical load. It posed a considerable venture considering Manitoba Hydro\u2019s overall ability stood at 6,100 megawatts. In contrast, British Columbia initiated a comparable suspension of carriers for brand-spanking new crypto miners in December 2022, affecting 21 tasks. However, BC has taken a divergent approach by introducing amendments to its Utilities Commission Act to regulate electricity service to cryptocurrency miners.

Notably, BC boasts some of North America\u2019s lowest industrial and industrial electricity charges, making it an attractive vacation spot for cryptocurrency miners seeking cost-effective energy answers. Conclusion Manitoba and British Columbia have both grappled with the impact of cryptocurrency mining on their respective electric infrastructures, prompting them to implement measures to control the demand for electricity from this area. Manitoba\u2019s choice to increase the moratorium on new electric provider requests for cryptocurrency operations underscores the province\u2019s commitment to addressing these challenges proactively and sustainably. Similarly, BC\u2019s circular to introduce regulatory amendments reflects a concerted effort to strive for stability by facilitating financial development and safeguarding the stability of its electrical grid.","article_summary":"The Canadian province of Manitoba has opted to extend a moratorium on new requests for electric providers from the authorities-owned Manitoba Hydro company meant for cryptocurrency operations.

The token has now increased by 21% in a week, with its returns coming as meme coins make a recovery across the board. But with SHIB still down by 2.5% in the last 30 days, it still has plenty of space to recover further in the coming days. This is particularly the case when Shiba Inu remains one of the strongest meme coins in terms of its fundamentals, with this week seeing the announcement of a $12 million raise for the coin\u2019s new layer-three network. Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Meme Coins Bounce Back \u2013 Can SHIB Overtake Ethereum? It\u2019s debatable as to what SHIB is going to do in the near term, with its indicators looking as though it may need to dip a little before we see more gains. Its 30-day average (orange) has been above its 200-day (average) for a few days now, and while it may hang in there for a few days yet, it seems to have lost momentum. Source: TradingView Likewise, SHIB\u2019s relative strength index (purple) is hovering around the 50 mark, having declined from 80 a few days ago and looking like it may drop towards 30 or 20 before picking up again. What\u2019s discouraging for SHIB is that its trading volume today is $700 million, in contrast to the $13 billion levels we saw in early March. Clearly, major demand has not yet returned to Shiba Inu, which may seesaw between recovery and dips for as long as it struggles to attract new volume. 3,000,000,000,000 #SHIB (79,947,000 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/V8B7aaSbae \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 24, 2024 Having said that, the very early hours of this morning did see a SHIB transfer worth $79.9 million between two unknown wallets. This suggests that some whales may have begun accumulating the token again, and that we may be at the beginning of an uptrend. It\u2019s arguable that such a trend began when Shiba Inu\u2019s developers announced they had raised $12 million for its new privacy-focused layer-three network. There\u2019s no release date yet for this new network, although what is known is that it will have its own native TREAT token, which will be the final non-stablecoin Shiba Inu ecosystem coin. This launch points to sustained future growth for Shiba Inu and the Shiba Inu price, which could reach $0.000040 by the summer. New High-Potential Meme Tokens While SHIB is undoubtedly one of the most solid meme coins in the market, there are other, smaller cap tokens that could be worth a look if traders wish to maximize their exposure to the potential upside. In fact, there are several promising meme coins in the market right now that boast some very strong fundamentals, and that are also holding their presales and generating plenty of momentum. One of the best of these is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme token that has raised over $10 million in its sale. Let\u2019s go! #DOGEVERSE raises over $10 Million! Another incredible milestone ticked off! Join #Cosmo on his multi-chain adventures! pic.twitter.com/wNIPuHhplr \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 24, 2024 As the first ever Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, DOGEVERSE will operate on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base. This will give it very wide application, with the token potentially finding usage on numerous apps within numerous ecosystems. As such, it could experience strong demand, which in turn will boost its price over time, especially when it comes with a hard cap of 200 million tokens. On top of this, holders will be able to stake the token, earning themselves a passive income while also taking much of the DOGEVERSE supply out of circulation. In other words, DOGEVERSE could rise strongly in price, with investors able to buy it early and cheaply by going to the official Dogeverse website. 1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000301, although this will rise in just under a day. And given that meme coins have outperformed much of the market this year, this price could surge dramatically once the token lists on trading platforms.

The move comes in response to allegations that Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company, PDVSA, has been utilizing Tether to bypass sanctions imposed on its crude oil and fuel exports. Tether has said it is committed to complying with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list and ensuring the prompt freezing of addresses linked to sanctioned entities. USDT Used to Bypass Oil Sanctions A recent Reuters report shed light on the alleged use of cryptocurrencies by PDVSA to facilitate its oil exports amidst newly reimposed oil sanctions by the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has mandated that PDVSA customers and providers wind down transactions by May 31 due to Venezuela\u2019s failure to implement electoral reforms. According to anonymous sources cited in the report, the reimposed sanctions will pose challenges for Venezuela in expanding its oil production and exports, as companies will require U.S. authorizations to conduct business with the country. Important I personally don\u2019t like the sound of this at all. Tether $usdt vows to freeze assets after Venezuela looks to crypto to bypass oil sanctions Once this becomes real, this will give a green-light for serious limitations KYC, AML and crackdown on #stables pic.twitter.com/qqgbW6gj3W \u2014 Reda | IPC (@Reda_IPC) April 23, 2024 In an effort to mitigate the risk of funds being frozen in foreign bank accounts as the sanctions take effect, PDVSA has reportedly turned to Tether for its oil sales. The report further reveals that PDVSA has restructured its spot oil deals, requiring prepayment in USDT for exported cargo. Additionally, the Venezuelan oil company allegedly mandates that new customers engaging in oil transactions hold cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. To meet these requirements, companies seeking to resume business with PDVSA after receiving a six-month licensing approval from the U.S. in October 2023 had to rely on intermediaries to facilitate cryptocurrency payments. These developments follow previous reports in 2023 that tied cryptocurrency payments to a corruption scandal at PDVSA, involving the discovery of $21 billion in unaccounted receivables related to oil exports. By freezing addresses associated with sanctioned entities, Tether aims to prevent the circumvention of sanctions and reinforce compliance efforts. Tether Surpasses $100 Billion Market Cap In early March, Tether\u2019s USDT surpassed a market capitalization of $100 billion, with an impressive growth of 9% year-to-date. Comparatively, USDT maintains a lead of over $71 billion in market cap when compared to its closest competitor, USD Coin (USDC). Despite the success, concerns about the quality of assets backing USDT have lingered in the crypto space. A recent United Nations report highlighted Tron\u2019s popularity among cyber fraud and money laundering activities in Southeast Asia. Tether has refuted these claims, emphasizing its collaboration with law enforcement and the traceability of its token. Last week, Tether partnered with digital assets infrastructure provider Fuze to enhance education and awareness surrounding digital assets in Turkey and the Middle East. Per the announcement, the two companies aim to address various aspects of education within the digital asset realm, including cross-border payment solutions, compliance, regulatory framework development, and education for local financial institutions.

In a recent blog post, Block unveiled its accomplishment of designing a standalone three-nanometer (3nm) Bitcoin mining chip and disclosed that it is currently collaborating with a leading global semiconductor foundry to finalize the chip\u2019s design. However, the company\u2019s mining project doesn\u2019t stop at chip development. It plans to expand its efforts to include system design as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time talking to a wide variety of Bitcoin miners to identify the challenges faced by mining operators,\u201d the announcement reads. \u201cBuilding on these insights and pursuant to our goal of supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone mining chip as well as a full mining system of our own design.\u201d Block Aims to Decentralize Supply of Mining Hardware Concerns over network stability and hardware vulnerabilities have long plagued the Bitcoin community. The ASIC chips used in mining rigs are predominantly manufactured in China, a country that has exhibited hostility towards the cryptocurrency sector. Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block initiative aims to decentralize the supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate, which serves as a measure of industry competition and mining difficulty. One major obstacle that Block seeks to overcome is the limited availability and high cost of mining rigs. Additionally, the company aims to improve the user experience and reliability of mining operations, addressing common issues such as heat dissipation and noise production. While specific details regarding the mining system are scarce in the announcement, Dorsey had previously mentioned the possibility of a \u201cBitcoin mining system based on custom silicon.\u201d He also emphasized the need for more vertical integration and diversification in silicon design, which he believes is currently concentrated among a few companies. The latest development comes shortly after the most recent Bitcoin halving, which occurred recently and reduced the issuance of new Bitcoin by half. Dorsey\u2019s vision of accessible mining extends beyond generating new Bitcoin. \u201cMining needs to be more distributed. The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the bitcoin network becomes.\u201d Square is considering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide. If we do this, we\u2019d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community.

As reported, Gridless has found an innovative way to power its operations and bring electricity to rural homes. Located near Hell\u2019s Gate National Park, it has set up shop at the site of an extinct volcano, where the company utilizes a mobile container equipped with solar power and energy from a nearby geothermal site. Gridless operates six mines across Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, all powered by a combination of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin mining has faced criticism due to its energy consumption. However, when coupled with renewable energy sources, it can help unlock trapped renewable power and incentivize increased production.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the Bosera-HashKey Capital spot ETFs are scheduled to begin trading on April 30. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently granted approval to several fund managers to offer these ETFs in a bid to establish itself as a hub for digital assets by introducing a range of cryptocurrency ETFs. Chinese asset managers are also preparing for the introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, drawing comparisons to the highly successful three-month-old US Bitcoin funds that have amassed an impressive $56 billion in assets to date. Chinese Investors Might Show Interest in Hong Kong\u2019s ETFs Potential sources of demand for Hong Kong\u2019s spot crypto ETFs include Chinese wealth invested in the city, as well as Asia-Pacific crypto exchanges and market makers. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Rebecca Sin estimates that these funds could accumulate $1 billion in assets under management over the next two years. The US-based Bitcoin funds offered by major players like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have sparked global interest and attracted significant investment. However, the prospective Hong Kong issuers, including Harvest Global Investments Ltd. and a partnership between HashKey Capital Ltd. and Bosera Asset Management (International) Co., may lack the same level of recognition. Giant #Bitcoin Spot ETF ads spotted in Hong Kong pic.twitter.com/7RTzg5fxsj \u2014 The Crypto News (@TCNCRYPTO) April 15, 2024 Roger Li, co-founder of One Satoshi, a Hong Kong-based chain of stores offering cash-to-crypto conversions, told Bloomberthat expectations for ETF demand should be adjusted considering the city\u2019s smaller financial sector. The US Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly allowed ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin earlier this year but remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies due to market volatility and past incidents of fraud. Approving ETFs for Ether, the second-largest digital asset, will likely present additional challenges. In contrast, Hong Kong has given initial approval for spot-Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, with the added distinction that the HashKey Capital and Bosera offerings will utilize an in-kind subscription and redemption mechanism. This mechanism allows for the direct exchange of underlying assets for ETF units, offering greater efficiency and arbitrage opportunities compared to the cash redemption model employed by US funds. Hong Kong Offers Futures-Based ETFs The city already permits crypto futures-based ETFs, and a framework for stablecoins is also in development. The success of Hong Kong as a crypto hub remains uncertain, but the ETF launches benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s impressive rally over the past year, attracting significant interest from Bitcoin holders. However, it will take time for the virtual asset ETF infrastructure to fully develop, opening the door for more participants, increased liquidity, and improved market conditions. As digital assets continue to gain popularity in China, with a mixed outlook for stocks and a weak real estate sector, the demand for cryptocurrencies remains strong. However, crypto trading is prohibited on the mainland, leading to underground activity, and the upcoming fund launches in Hong Kong are likely to be beyond the reach of Chinese investors accessing Hong Kong ETFs through specific programs.

This puts CoinPoker in line with other online gambling sites, such as Rollbit, and it could end up being something that helps the newer site gain more market share over time. This is particularly the case when CoinPoker offers many of the features provided by sites such as Rollbit, while also adding several more unique propositions, such as poker games against human opponents. And given that the removal of withdrawal fees comes at a time when gambling coins such as Rollbit (RLB) have been performing well, its implementation could help CoinPoker\u2019s own CHP token post some gains. Crypto Betting App CoinPoker Follows Rollbit With Zero Withdrawal Fees Trend Announcing the new policy yesterday, CoinPoker\u2019s official X account explained that \u201call cashout fees have been eliminated on CoinPoker\u201d and that only \u201cthe standard network transaction fees will apply\u201d to customer withdrawals. We are pleased to inform you that all cashout fees have been eliminated on CoinPoker. Only the standard network transaction fees will apply to your withdrawals. If you have questions or need help, contact our support team at support@coinpoker.com. Let's play!\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6dkKphLbwb \u2014 CoinPoker (@CoinPoker_OFF) April 23, 2024 CoinPoker had previously applied \u201cnominal fees\u201d to withdrawals, in order to help fund the stability and security of its site. However, it\u2019s now able to ensure security without taking withdrawal fees, a move that\u2019s likely to help the site grow its already expanding user base. SimilarWeb currently ranks it 90th globally in the poker category, with the site having risen 14 places between February and March. It could continue rising up the rankings following this announcement, with CoinPoker arguably providing a stronger user experience than many of its rivals. For instance, while it offers an online casino much like rivals such as Rollbit, its poker section also covers games against other human players. This has particularly come to the fore in its Crypto Series of Poker (CSOP) tournament, which it launched this month and which is offering a guaranteed prize pool of at least $1 million. This tournament saw celebrity poker player Tony G win just over $300,000 in a single game over the weekend, while it also saw the same player win the largest ever prize pot recorded in online poker in February 2022, at $7.7 million. Poker Tokens Show Potential Combined with the new removal of withdrawal fees, CoinPoker\u2019s status as the best place on the Internet for crypto-friendly poker should help it bite into the market share of sites such as Rollbit. In turn, it should also boost the price of CoinPoker\u2019s native token, CHP. The latter is up by 1% in the past 24 hours, with buyers likely responding to yesterday\u2019s news. At $0.05848, it has gained by 5% in the past fortnight, although it remains down by 43% in a year. Yet this decline means that the coin is now trading at a good discount, and with CoinPoker expanding consistently, it may only be a matter of time before CHP posts some strong gains. Source: TradingView It could end up following in the footsteps of Rollbit\u2019s own coin, RLB, which has recorded a 670% increase in the last 12 months.

FLOKI has now gained by an impressive 40% in a week, and while the meme token remains down by 15% in a month, it has also increased by 600% in the past year. These figures make Floki Inu one of the best-performing major meme coins of this period, with its gains over the past few days coming after Revolut announced it would be listing the FLOKI token. And with the wider market improving today after a difficult couple of weeks, we could see more Floki price gains very soon. Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Suddenly Spikes Up 15% \u2013 Are Whales Buying? FLOKI\u2019s indicators remain in a very bullish position, signalling that the coin could continue to post gains in the near term. Its 30-day average (orange) is still rising further beyond the 200-day average (blue), providing a clear sign that the token remains in a growth phase. Source: TradingView At the same time, FLOKI\u2019s RSI is hanging around the 60 mark, where it could easily rise again once the past hour\u2019s dip has played out. It\u2019s also bullish that the coin\u2019s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are rising in parallel, with $0.00020 being the key resistance to watch. If Floki can break through this price, we could certainly see more buyers entering its market and pushing its price up further. At the moment, there haven\u2019t been any recent signs of big transfers involving whales, yet the fact that FLOKI\u2019s volume has risen from $100 million over the weekend to nearly $500 million today would certainly suggest that traders are stocking up on the coin. #FLOKI just got listed on Revolut, the biggest neobank and retail trading app in Europe! This listing will make $FLOKI accessible to @RevolutApp's 40 million+ users in 150+ countries who will be able to buy FLOKI with 25+ fiat currencies including GBP, EUR, USD and more. Users\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Hy62VJw2w4 \u2014 FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) April 22, 2024 Driving interest in Floki has been the aforementioned announcement that Revolut has added support for the token, meaning that around 40 million of the fintech\u2019s customers could potentially become FLOKI holders. Not only is this a vote of confidence in the meme coin, but it offers a reminder that it could see further listings in the near future, with Coinbase (for example) yet to add the token. And seeing as how the wider market is expecting an improvement in macroeconomic conditions later in the year (e.g. rate cuts), the Floki price could continue to rise as positivity increases. It may reach $0.00025 by the end of summer, before breaking its record high ($0.0003365) in the final quarter of 2024. Other High-Potential Meme Tokens FLOKI looks very good at the moment, but it isn\u2019t the only growing meme token that could post some very big gains in the near future. There are also various recently launched meme coins that are showing strong potential, with several presale tokens generating lots of momentum as they get ready to list. One of the hottest of these is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based cryptocurrency that has raised more than $10 million in its soon-to-be-closing sale. Prepare for a moonshot as we ready the engines of the Slothship! With the launch just around the corner, our slothful crew is gearing up for an epic journey through the crypto cosmos. Buckle up and hold onto your branches, because there's just 6 days to go \u2026 pic.twitter.com/yHBrE3NP5x \u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 22, 2024 The sale will end in five days, at which point the coin will hold its airdrop and list on trading platforms. Given that it has raised over $10 million in a matter of weeks, its listings could see it post some very big gains. On the one hand, this will be helped by the fact that it\u2019s launching at a time when demand for Solana-based meme coins is still high, with certain tokens (e.g. DogWifHat) enjoying eye-watering returns in recent months. On the other hand, Slothana has already done a good job in building a strong online community, with its official X account now having more than 24,000 followers. Because meme tokens often live or die by the health of their communities, Slothana\u2019s ability to generate a following so quickly is a good sign for its future. Investors can join its sale at the Slothana website, where they can buy the token at a rate of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH. This works out at about $0.0156 per token, a price that could end up seeming very cheap once the token lists in less than a week.

He claims the tech giant\u2019s current system may not support offline payments for any European Central Bank digital currency. The member, Piero Cipollone, outlined his concerns in a letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager dated April 19. \u201cApple\u2019s proposed commitments would not give third parties full access to the secure element (SE), but only allow for the usage of Host Card Emulation (HCE),\u201d he said. For clarification, a secure element (SE) is a specialized chip engineered for enhanced security. It functions like a miniature safe within a device, commonly present in smartphones, tablets, and certain credit cards. Also, he thinks Apple\u2019s proposal may not offer the same level of authentication and transaction speed as ApplePay. Apple didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time. Limited NFC Access on iPhones Creates Friction for Potential Digital Euro Cipollone added that currently, Apple\u2019s proposals don\u2019t ensure a fair level playing field for third-party payment solutions. This is especially true for in-store payments with iPhones. Were these proposals to be applied to a potential digital euro, they wouldn\u2019t guarantee user-friendly payments on iPhone, the economist said. He also noted certain limitations with the EU\u2019s recent antitrust investigation into Apple. It doesn\u2019t address limited access to near-field communication (NFC) technology in various payment situations, including person-to-person payments, he said. \u201cWe note that this use case is crucial for the digital euro,\u201d he said. ECB Pushes for Open Access to Phone Security Chips for Digital Euro According to the economist, the proposed digital euro regulation requires device manufacturers and electronic communication service providers to offer fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory access to the secure element in their devices. He said this access should be unrestricted and not reliant on other mobile operating system applications. This ensures that digital euro payments on mobile devices are user-friendly. The European Commission has released draft laws outlining the groundwork for a potential digital euro. This includes establishing basic criteria and preparing necessary legislation for potential issuance. In late 2023, the ECB initiated a two-year preparatory phase for the digital euro. This phase involves finalizing regulations, selecting private-sector collaborators, and conducting testing and experimentation.

The latest in crypto\u2019s long line of Shiba Inu-inspired funny tokens has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see its cross-chain capabilities as a hint of what tomorrow\u2019s meme coins will look like. Currently priced at $0.000301 and due to rise in just under two days, Dogeverse has already sold out its soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launch. A meaty $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated for the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team\u2019s initial expectation of a 6-day first round. Fast forward one fortnight and Dogeverse has already moved onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens will be sold to the public across five remaining rounds that close on June 11. The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used for liquidity and buy-back funds. Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards. The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap. But why exactly is everybody lapping up Dogeverse? Let\u2019s go! #DOGEVERSE raises over $10 Million! Another incredible milestone ticked off! Join #Cosmo on his multi-chain adventures! pic.twitter.com/wNIPuHhplr \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 24, 2024 Dogeverse: The First Multi-Chain Good Boy It all started with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. His adorable avatar didn\u2019t need much selling because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!) Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but none of them are inherently multi-chain. Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, and as another proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, it eats up a lot of electricity to validate blocks and mine DOGE. Since then, Dogecoin\u2019s competitors have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Dogeverse is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism. It is already live on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Base and Avalanche. A Solana rollout is planned soon. At the center of the Dogeverse is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes. Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners. Introducing #Cosmo, the remarkable #Doge born from stardust! As the ambassador of #DOGEVERSE, Cosmo symbolizes liberty, ingenuity, and unity. Embark with him on an adventure across the #Crypto cosmos, breaking barriers and venturing into uncharted territories together. pic.twitter.com/wzLatjuLMu \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 21, 2024 Dogeverse, The Halving, Onwards As any holder will tell you, meme coins are some of crypto\u2019s most volatile investments. This is because they have a tendency to exaggerate broader market-wide price movements. This means, for instance, that on days when investors are feeling risky and pumping Bitcoin, meme coins can often be found rallying harder. Conversely, a risk-off day in crypto may manifest itself in spiraling meme coin prices. Investors should be aware then, that meme coin performance is linked to crypto\u2019s perpetual news cycle. That said, two immediate price drivers will have a strong relationship to Cosmo\u2019s multi-chain Dogeverse. The first is last Saturday\u2019s Bitcoin halving. The halving slashes Bitcoin mining rewards in half, effectively choking the issuance of new BTC and helping drive prices higher. Halvings have historically catalyzed bull runs, and already we can see Bitcoin has risen steadily (3%) since the halving. The second is May 23. That\u2019s the SEC\u2019s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for an Ethereum ETF. Many analysts see the date as the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto\u2019s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit. As will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the Dogeverse. So Cosmo is clean and green, with staking and seamless multi-chain fun. What\u2019s not to love about crypto\u2019s new hyper-jumping pupper? Join the presale over on the Dogeverse website before the price rises in under two days.

According to a recent report by Antara, President Widodo highlighted the alarming volume of illicit financial flows during his address at the 22nd Anniversary of the National Movement for Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Prevention. Indonesia Joins Global Efforts in AML Through FATF Indonesia achieved a permanent position in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body combating money laundering and terror financing, following approval from member states at a meeting in Paris on October 25 last year. This milestone marked the culmination of Indonesia\u2019s efforts since June 29, 2018, when it first joined the FATF as an observer, steadily working towards becoming the organization\u2019s 40th member. Widodo expressed his hope that Indonesia\u2019s full membership in the FATF would motivate stakeholders to intensify their efforts against money laundering. He viewed the membership as crucial for enhancing Indonesia\u2019s economic credibility and improving the global perception of its financial system, which he believes will subsequently attract more investments. Widodo noted that Indonesia\u2019s FATF membership would provide support from 39 countries, which could offer expert testimony and evidence in efforts to combat money laundering, including crimes involving crypto. The importance of vigilance among stakeholders was also emphasized, particularly as money launderers increasingly exploit crypto markets to obscure their activities.

The move, reported by the Fox news, is aimed at attracting more sports enthusiast into the crypto space. Symbolized by pizza, these commercials showcase the process pizzas go through, if it was a money in today\u2019s system. \u201cIf pizza worked like this, you wouldn\u2019t like pizza,\u201d the ad narrates. The news of the Coinbase commercials hasn\u2019t been reported officially yet. It is set to run three separate ads across four channels telecasting NBA playoffs, starting Wednesday. The motive to run these ads is to emphasize how complex traditional payments systems are, when compared to cryptos. Two commercials are 30 seconds each and one run for 60 seconds, airing on ESPN, ESPN2, TNT and ABC. Further, the report added that these ads will run until June 9. \u201cWe\u2019re under the illusion that when we use credit cards or Venmo, things are happening instantly, but they\u2019re actually just part of very complex plumbing that\u2019s masked by a digital interface,\u201d Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at Coinbase, noted. Coinbase\u2019s Pizza Ad Journey The pizza, which is being described, will go through several scrutiny and approval stages, per the ad posted on YouTube.

As institutional players like Grayscale\u2019s GBTC near 300,000 Bitcoins, and additional spot Bitcoin ETFs emerge, the landscape evolves. Amidst these dynamics, Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction gains prominence, echoing both market optimism and the ongoing evolution of digital asset investment strategies.

Bitcoin\u2019s New BIP Editors Aim to Enhance Development Efficiency Bitcoin is undergoing significant changes to its Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process with the introduction of five new editors, moving away from the traditional single-editor system previously spearheaded by Luke Dashjr.

Zhao is scheduled for sentencing on April 30 in Seattle, having pleaded guilty in November to breaching US anti-money laundering laws. He stepped down from his role as CEO at the crypto exchange, yet retains majority ownership. As part of the agreement, he agreed to a $50m fine, while the company offered to pay $4.3b in fines and compensation. \u201cGiven the magnitude of Zhao\u2019s willful violation of US law and its consequences, an above-Guidelines sentence of 36 months is warranted,\u201d US prosecutors said. Binance didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time. Prosecutors Push for Harsher Punishment for Crypto Mogul\u2019s Crimes Zhao was initially set to face up to 18 months in prison, a condition he accepted without appeal. In November, he was released on a $175m bail while awaiting sentencing for banking law breaches. Still, he was required to adhere to travel restrictions within the US. Now, prosecutors want a more severe penalty for him than what the federal sentencing guidelines recommend. \u201cZhao reaped vast rewards for his violation of US law,\u201d the filing read. \u201cAnd the price of that violation must be significant to effectively punish Zhao for his criminal acts and to deter others who are tempted to build fortunes and business empires by breaking US law.\u201d Prosecutors claim that Zhao neglected to establish a robust anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance. This allegedly enabled illicit actors to exploit the exchange. Further, the actors used Binance for activities like operating mixing services to conceal crypto origins. Moreover, Binance is said to have facilitated Iranian customers\u2019 transactions with US customers. This move undermined US sanctions against Iran and jeopardized exchange liquidity. Operational Shortcomings and Reporting Failures In February, a settlement addressed significant operational deficiencies found within Binance. Notably, this included the platform\u2019s failure to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions linked to designated terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, al Qaeda, and ISIS. Additionally, Binance faced allegations of facilitating transactions related to child sexual abuse materials and proceeds from ransomware activities. Despite facing legal obstacles, Zhao\u2019s fortune has experienced significant growth over the past year, surging by nearly $10b, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Currently, his wealth exceeds $42b, making him the 29th wealthiest individual worldwide, according to the index.

In a recent blog post, Hayes highlighted the looming threat of a sovereign debt bubble on the horizon, which may intensify the macro setup favoring cryptocurrencies. Hayes said that there is a prevailing narrative gaining traction in both retail and institutional investing circles, pointing to major economic blocs like the US, China, the European Union (EU), and Japan debasing their currencies as a means to deleverage their governments\u2019 balance sheets. This narrative has spurred interest in crypto-derivative products, such as US Bitcoin ETFs, as traditional finance seeks to preserve wealth against the erosion of fiat currencies. Market to Continue Bullish Trajectory As Bitcoin experienced a period of weakness due to US tax payments on April 15 and the Bitcoin halving, Hayes said the market will continue its bullish trajectory, driving prices higher. Hayes emphasized that in markets, the strategies and factors that led to previous successes often differ from those that will drive future gains. However, he noted that the macro setup responsible for the fiat liquidity surge that fueled Bitcoin\u2019s remarkable ascent will only grow more pronounced as the sovereign debt bubble approaches its bursting point. As the global financial landscape evolves, Hayes urged caution against premature profit-taking and encourages investors to embrace the ongoing market momentum. He advocated existing in the \u201cLeft Curve,\u201d a mindset focused on seizing opportunities and adding to winning positions. Hayes added that he expects the bull market to continue, and the potential for Bitcoin to reach even higher price levels, far beyond its current position. \u201cHowever, the macro setup that created the fiat liquidity surge that powered Bitcoin\u2019s ascent will only get more pronounced as the sovereign debt bubble begins to burst.\u201d Bitcoin Stagnates as ETF Inflows Slow Down The price of Bitcoin has remained within the $66,000 range as of late amid slowing spot ETF inflows. According to SoSoValue, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF yesterday, April 23, was $31.6354 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net outflow of $66.8838 million. The single-day net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was $37.9233 million, and the current total historical net inflow of IBIT reached $15.479 billion. #Bitcoin ETFs Flow Net total inflow of 473.21 #BTC ($31.60M) https://t.co/kDuH3RuzEI pic.twitter.com/8wttktruvJ \u2014 CoinGlass (@coinglass_com) April 24, 2024 As reported, digital asset investment products have faced another week of outflows, marking the second consecutive week of declining investor interest. The outflows amounted to a total of $206 million, while trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) experienced a slight dip. Bitcoin investment products witnessed outflows of $192 million. However, few investors viewed this as an opportunity for short-selling, with short-Bitcoin strategies experiencing outflows of $0.3 million. The negative sentiment surrounding digital asset investment products was primarily observed in US ETFs, which saw outflows amounting to $244 million. The outflows were primarily focused on the existing ETFs, while newly issued ETFs continued to receive inflows, albeit at lower levels compared to previous weeks.

Gox-era Bitcoin in the coming weeks could unsettle the market and exert negative price pressure on Bitcoin, according to analysts at K33 Research. Earlier this week, some creditors of the now-defunct Mt. Gox crypto exchange shared updates on their claims on Reddit. These updates included information about the amount of cryptocurrency and fiat owed to the creditors, as well as completed repayment dates. Mt. Gox Creditors Could Receive Payments Next Month The new updates suggest that creditors might start receiving their Bitcoin as soon as next month, as noted by K33 Research analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde in an April 23 market note. The outstanding debt to Mt. Gox\u2019s 127,000 creditors amounts to over $9.4 billion in Bitcoin, $72 million in Bitcoin Cash, and $445.8 million (69 billion Japanese yen). Helseth and Lunde cautioned that the release of Bitcoin may not necessarily result in immediate selling pressure. However, they emphasized that the substantial \u201coverhang\u201d of 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH could \u201cspook the market.\u201d Mt.

Repayment possible by Oct 31, 2024 pic.twitter.com/n0iOYYmZUk \u2014 Kashif Raza (@simplykashif) April 22, 2024 Bitcoin is currently trading at just over $66,700, with recent volatility attributed to changing tensions in the Middle East and the Bitcoin halving that occurred on April 20. The Mt. Gox creditors have been eagerly awaiting the return of their funds for over a decade since the exchange\u2019s collapse in February 2014 due to a series of undetected hacks. In January, the Mt. Gox trustee initiated contact with creditors to verify their identities and the crypto exchange accounts that would be used for repaying the owed Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Some creditors had already begun receiving Japanese yen repayments by December of last year, and further fiat transfers were reported in March, according to the K33 report. While the final repayment deadline for base repayments, early lump-sum repayments, and intermediate repayments is currently set for October 31, 2024, it remains subject to potential changes. Bitcoin Surges After Halving While Bitcoin did not immediately react to the much-anticipated halving event, the leading cryptocurrency has since registered some gains. While some analysts, including JPMorgan, have cautioned about a potential further price slide following this quadrennial event, the overall consensus remains bullish in the long term. Just recently, Bitwise said that while the month immediately following the halving typically sees a modest drop in price, the subsequent year often witnesses exponential gains. The asset manager noted that following the 2012 halving, Bitcoin experienced a meager 9% increase in the month post-halving, only to skyrocket by a staggering 8,839% over the following year. Similar patterns were observed after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with Bitcoin\u2019s price surging significantly in the year following each event. Likewise, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has recently said that Bitcoin may experience some selling pressure in the lead-up to the highly anticipated halving event, but the long-term outlook remains bullish.

This approach is crucial to keep pace with the rapid advancements in the global landscape of financial technologies, he added. \u201cWhile crypto assets are relatively new, the need to ensure equitable taxation remains essential to promote economic growth and provide revenue for crucial public investments in areas like infrastructure, education and healthcare,\u201d Utama said. ATO-DGT Collaboration Sets New Standards A history of collaboration exists between the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the Indonesian DGT. This partnership has included various DGT priorities. It includes aspects like the digitization of taxpayer services through the introduction of a virtual tax assistant. Additionally, the two entities have worked together on the implementation of value-added tax (VAT) for digital goods and services. Regulations and Information Sharing Take Center Stage Indonesia has been proactively formulating regulations for the crypto sector. It has also fostered collaborations with foreign countries and international entities to craft a strong crypto framework. Spearheading these initiatives is Indonesia\u2019s Financial Services Authority (OJK), which has been collaborating with financial regulators in Malaysia, Singapore, and Dubai to lay down a solid groundwork for crypto policy. Per a recent regulation, crypto firms intending to operate in Indonesia must undergo assessment within a regulatory sandbox before obtaining licensing, effective from Jan. 2025. This regulatory adjustment coincides with the transition of oversight of the crypto sector to the Financial Services Authority (OJK). Entities providing cryptocurrency services in Indonesia without undergoing sandbox assessment will be considered to be operating unlawfully. Meanwhile, Australia is among numerous countries engaged in cooperation with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a framework for the automatic exchange of information regarding crypto-assets, known as the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The objective is to establish a uniform method for taxing cryptocurrencies globally. Although not specifically a bilateral tax treaty, this collaboration seeks to enhance tax transparency and mitigate tax evasion concerning crypto profits.

Per Newsis, the Busan Police Agency Drug Crime Investigation Unit said the gang had smuggled and sold almost $1.5 million worth of narcotics to crypto-paying buyers. South Korean Police Arrest \u2018Gang Leader\u2019 in Philippines Officers said they were currently trying to \u201crepatriate\u201d the gang\u2019s suspected ringleader, who appears to be based in the Philippines. Police said the gang smuggled drugs including methamphetamine (crystal meth) and synthetic marijuana into the country from the Philippines. Officers also believe the gang sold drugs to buyers in the Philippines. A spokesperson told reporters that the gang had used drug smugglers to conceal bags of drugs inside women\u2019s sanitary products. The smugglers then tried to evade detection at airports by wearing these sanitary products in their underwear. The spokesperson added that the gang contacted drug users via 11 different Telegram channels, with the customers paying in crypto. Gang Allegedly Used Crypto, Telegram, and Dead-dropped Drug Deliveries As has previously been the case, the gang arranged to \u201cdead-drop\u201d narcotics in residential areas of the buyers\u2019 choosing in South Korea. Officers said the group typically chose to hide drugs in \u201celectric terminal boxes and fire hydrants\u201d in residential areas. Bags of methamphetamine (crystal meth) seized by Busan Police Agency officers. (Source: Busan Police Agency) Police Arrest Suspected Dealers, Smugglers, and Drug Users Dealers would then allegedly send the buyers photographs and GPS location data to help them find the hidden drugs. Police said the group began its operations in August last year, and added that some of the arrestees detained in both South Korea and the Philippines were charged with drug use. Officers in Busan also arrested four suspected smugglers and 12 suspected dealers. Their counterparts in the Philippines arrested five suspected smugglers and 27 suspected dealers. The spokesperson said that officers also confiscated 4.8kg of drugs, including 1.2kg of methamphetamine, as well as almost $41,000 worth of fiat. Cash and narcotics-related items seized by Busan Police Agency officers. (Source: Busan Police Agency) CCTV Footage Helped Police Officers said they had tracked the gang for several weeks by \u201canalyzing Telegram messages\u201d and footage from over 1,500 CCTV units. The Busan force added that it had worked with law enforcement agencies in the Philippines on the case, as well as Interpol and the South Korean National Intelligence Service. Seo Sang-tae, the head of the Busan Police Drug Crime Investigation Unit, said his unit would continue to \u201cinvestigate internet drug transactions.\u201d The Busan Police Agency added that it was \u201cconducting an intensive crackdown on drug crimes.\u201d Last year, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared an \u201call-out war\u201d on crypto-powered drug trafficking.

HBAR peaked at $0.18, its highest price for the past two years, doubling its price overnight. Investors in HBAR saw rumors that the Hedera blockchain carried one of BlackRock\u2019s tokenized assets. Reportedly, Hedera carried a token linked to one of BlackRock\u2019s Money Market Funds (MMF). Today we witness #RWA history as @BlackRock\u2019s ICS US Treasury money market fund (MMF) is tokenized on @Hedera with @ArchaxEx and @OwneraIO, marking a major milestone in asset management by bringing the world\u2019s largest asset manager on-chain üè¶ pic.twitter.com/1Kye8cjAJx \u2014 HBAR Foundation (@HBAR_foundation) April 23, 2024 After the initial hype, HBAR retreated again to $0.13, potentially extending the slide. HBAR has mostly moved horizontally in the past two years and has not reached its previous peak. BlackRock Not Directly Involved in Token Generation on Archax Platform After the 100% rally, it became clear that BlackRock is not using Hedera directly. However, a Hedera-linked project, Archax, explained it stands behind the new asset listing. Real-world asset listing is technologically possible for any blockchain, but in this case, HBAR spiked due to the belief that the BlackRock fund was directly involved. \u201cArchax, today announced the expansion of fund shares it offers in tokenised form with the @BlackRock ICS US Treasury MMF. This builds on its launch of tokenised access to @abrdn_plc MMFs last year, created on both the @hedera and #Ethereum\"https://t.co/p1rdYuPi75 \u2014 Archax (@ArchaxEx) April 23, 2024 Archax has already tokenized money market funds linked to the US dollar, as well as to GBP and EUR. Archax aims to popularize its trading platform, offering a relatively easy on-ramp for new investors. On its side, BlackRock has experimented with digital assets and tokenization. But its tokenized assets would arrive through a partnership with Securitize. Through Securitize, BlackRock aims to enter the market for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, bridging the gap between mainstream investors and decentralized finance. After a period of meme coin creation, vaporware and NFT hype, the recent HBAR rally showed the market may be ready for real utility and added mainstream acceptance. Various attempts have been made to tokenize real-world assets, including niche assets and shares as well as physical items. So far, stablecoins like Tether and USD Coin have been the best applications of real-world value tied up in tokens. Recently, gold-backed assets have also had a field day, even trading above the market price of physical gold at one point. Is HBAR Safe to Trade? The dust has not settled yet for HBAR, as the asset trades with anomalous daily volumes. In the past day, HBAR trades peaked at $3.14B, which is a record for the token. In the past day, more than 62% of the token\u2019s supply changed hands in a trading frenzy. HBAR may slip fast, as the 2% liquidity depth on Binance is still relatively low at $838K. The token\u2019s liquidity scores are relatively low, below 700 on CoinMarketCap. This means that its price could be very unstable. HBAR may return to a lower range before establishing a more sustainable trend based on chart analysis. The token is widely used, with more than 71% of the supply in active circulation. The goal of HBAR is utility, but the Hedera community has been hoping for a higher price range during the new bull cycle. Looking for something like this after completing a nice 5 wave impulse off the lows. Note the first step is a break in lower timeframe market structure to kick things into gear. After that if we can print a higher low we should be able to run it back to the highs.$HBAR https://t.co/1aCnnkinHl pic.twitter.com/CJ97RVtD0g \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) April 24, 2024 HBAR has been a speculative bet over the past few years. Hedera aimed to place itself as an alternative to Ethereum, bringing a graph-like structure instead of a blockchain. However, once the novelty wore out, HBAR also fell out of favor with investors. The Coinglass funding rate for HBAR continues to be negative, as holders of short positions must pay to continue the shorting. At this point, HBAR may return to its pre-pump levels or continue trading anomalously in the case of a short squeeze.","article_summary":"Hedera (HBAR), the token behind Hedera Hashgraph, held a spectacular rally at the start of the new week.

This strategy is grounded in the perceived stability of Bitcoin, the reliability of established large-cap coins, and the potential for significant returns from smaller, riskier projects. In the context of Flow Coin, the analysis emphasizes the ongoing development and innovation within the Flow ecosystem, even amidst challenges faced by similar organizations. The mention of achievements in Q1 underscores the potential of Flow as a layer 1 blockchain for building and scaling mainstream innovations. This positive outlook suggests that Flow is actively contributing to the blockchain space, which may attract interest from investors seeking promising projects. One notable factor contributing to the increased interest in Flow is a listing announcement on Coinbase, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. The \u201cCoinbase effect\u201d refers to the potential impact on a cryptocurrency\u2019s price and visibility after being listed on the Coinbase platform. Such listings often lead to increased accessibility and exposure, potentially influencing investor sentiment and driving demand. Before delving into the Flow Coin price prediction, the narrative emphasizes a positive perception. This may be attributed to the ongoing developments in the Flow ecosystem, achievements in Q1, and the significant Coinbase listing. The positive tone sets the stage for a more optimistic assessment of Flow Coin\u2019s future performance. In 2024, the cryptocurrency market is maturing, elevating its status to be on par with more traditional asset classes. Despite navigating through a year of economic uncertainties, Bitcoin and Ethereum are standing out and gaining popularity as sought-after alternatives to conventional stocks and bonds. They are proving their resilience and attractiveness in the evolving financial landscape. Cryptopolitan How Much is Flow Worth? Today, Flow is priced at $0.998, with a 24-hour trading volume of $92.66M and a market capitalization of $1.50B, commanding a market dominance of 0.06%. Over the past day, the FLOW price has risen by 5.49%. Sentiment towards Flow\u2019s price prediction is currently bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index at 72 (Greed). Flow has a circulating supply of 1.50B FLOW out of a maximum supply of 1.37B FLOW. The yearly supply inflation rate stands at 44.94%, resulting in the creation of 465.68M FLOW over the last year. In terms of market cap rankings, Flow holds the #4 position in the NFT Tokens sector and #34 in the Layer 1 sector. Flow Coin price analysis: FLOW obtains a long-term bullish momentum at $0.998 TLDR Breakdown FLOW price analysis is bullish today. The strongest resistance is present at $1.357. Current Flow price is $0.998 at the time of writing. Flow cryptocurrency initiated a noticeable ascent on April 24, 2024, starting from its initial value of $0.936. Despite encountering intermittent fluctuations, it gradually rose to a peak of $1.026 before stabilizing at a significantly higher level. Following this peak, Flow continued its upward trajectory, consistently hovering around the $0.998 range. This ability to sustain its price amid market fluctuations highlighted Flow\u2019s resilience, strength, and adaptability. Investors observed with confidence as Flow demonstrated its robustness, indicating a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency despite market uncertainties. Flow cryptocurrency experienced a significant increase in value when it began at a price of $0.936. Despite encountering some ups and downs along the way, it gradually climbed to a high point of $1.026 before stabilizing at a higher level than its initial value. Even after reaching this peak, Flow continued to maintain its upward trend, consistently staying around the $0.998 range. This ability to sustain its price despite fluctuations in the market indicates that Flow is resilient and adaptable. Investors observed this behavior with confidence, suggesting that Flow\u2019s positive performance could continue even in uncertain market conditions. Flow Coin price analysis for 1-hour: Recent developments The Flow Coin has been steadily climbing, although recent signs suggest a potential slowdown in its upward momentum. Notably, a significant hurdle lies at $1.013, acting as a strong resistance level. Conversely, a robust support zone is emerging around the lower boundary of the Bollinger Band at $0.928, crucial for reinforcing the coin\u2019s upward trend and mitigating downward pressures. Furthermore, the price is trying to surpass the resistance level, signaling a market breakout. Although this breakout might lead to a reversal, a favorable outcome could involve the resistance level retracing, ideally to a higher position. The Moving Average analysis suggests a bearish trend, indicating a likelihood of further downward price movements. Traders are advised to remain vigilant and adaptable to shifts in market sentiment. The current price trend is consistent with this bearish outlook, as prices fall within the upper and lower thresholds of the Bollinger Bands. A decisive breach of the upper threshold could signal a reversal, potentially leading to significant price gains. Given these conditions, maintaining a heightened level of awareness is crucial. This enables traders to promptly identify any deviations from the prevailing trend. By taking a proactive approach, traders can make informed decisions in response to evolving market dynamics, optimizing their trading strategies for maximum effectiveness. FLOW/USD 1-hour price chart Source: TradingView Currently, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Flow Coin stands at 58, indicating a phase of market stability marked by a significant balance between buying and selling activities, suggesting potential market equilibrium. However, the downward trajectory of the RSI signals the decreasing price of FLOW and the discrepancy between selling pressure and buying action, implying the continuation of Flow Coin\u2019s unstable trend. Despite ongoing selling pressure, maintaining a vigilant stance and prioritizing the identification of potential market risks is crucial. Consistently monitoring the RSI and staying keenly attuned to shifts in buying and selling dynamics will be essential for traders to make well-informed decisions amidst evolving market conditions. This cautious approach is highly recommended for effectively navigating potential fluctuations and uncertainties in the market landscape. Flow Coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW bullish at $0.998 Assessing the value of Flow Coin involves navigating a complex landscape of bullish and bearish factors contributing to observable price fluctuations in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The Bollinger Bands model is a crucial tool in this assessment, indicating a significant resistance level at $1.357 for Flow Coin. Surpassing this barrier could initiate an upward trajectory. Additionally, technical analysis identifies a strong support level at $0.712, acting as a price floor where seller interest reignites and defending against sharp price declines. This intricate interplay between resistance and support levels underscores the nuanced evaluation of Flow Coin\u2019s value within the dynamic cryptocurrency market, highlighting the delicate balance of market forces in play. FLOW/USD 1-day price chart Source: TradingView A detailed analysis of Flow Coin\u2019s price dynamics reveals that the current Relative Strength Index (RSI) level of 44 indicates a phase of market stability. However, the observed pattern in the RSI suggests a potential shift towards an unstable market sentiment, marked by the emergence of an upward trend where buying activity exceeds selling activity. This upward momentum reflects increased engagement from buyers, actively influencing market direction. This dynamic interaction highlights an ongoing market battle, with participants vying to shape Flow Coin\u2019s price movements. The balanced RSI and the downward trend pattern denote a fluid market environment, necessitating vigilant monitoring for potential shifts in market dynamics. What to Expect from the Flow Price Analysis Based on our analysis of its price dynamics, a mix of positive and negative factors are influencing Flow Coin\u2019s future in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The coin has shown itself to be strong and flexible, staying steady in the face of market volatility, even though current patterns suggest that its upward trajectory may be slowing down. The Bollinger Bands model and technical analysis help traders navigate the market by highlighting critical resistance and support levels. Flow Coin\u2019s performance remains dynamic and susceptible to ongoing market conflicts despite many hurdles such as negative trends from moving averages and potential instability from the RSI. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow (FLOW) presents a compelling investment opportunity based on its current market performance and positive indicators. With a bullish sentiment, market stability, and resilience against price fluctuations, Flow demonstrates potential for significant gains. Its upward trajectory, reinforced by technical analysis and support levels, indicates a promising outlook for investors. However, as with any investment in the cryptocurrency market, there are inherent risks, including volatility and uncertainty. Therefore, investors should conduct thorough research, assess their risk tolerance, and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions in Flow or any other cryptocurrency. Recent news on Flow Coin FLOW Blockchain reports the introduction and deployment of the Crescendo Previewnet. Stated differently, an environment for scaling Ethereum virtual machines (EVMs) is offered by the Crescendo Previewnet. They highlight Crescendo\u2019s alleged potential to offer mainstream scalability in addition to a smooth integration with the FLOW ecosystem. Recall that this is merely a prototype version of Crescendo; testing and development for the final version are probably not too far off. Users are encouraged to begin experimenting with the platform since FLOW Blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), allowing developers to use their existing Ethereum tools within the FLOW ecosystem.

The company will use $15 million for the TV ads that will air during the NBA playoffs, which are expected to kick off on Wednesday. Coinbase ads highlight banking flaws with Pizza The campaign consists of two separate commercials: one 30-second video and the other 60 seconds. These commercial ads will be featured on four major channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, and ABC. The sole purpose of these ads Is to build awareness among the crypto market on sports fans. By implementing a strangulate storyline involving pizza, Coinbase seeks to clarify the complexity generally found in traditional payment systems. The commercial used the analogy of a pizza undergoing tests and approval, as in the case of a regular bank transaction. The goal is to clarify the complications and charges associated with conventional banking and credit card utilization. The ads will air until June 9, during which time they will receive heavy coverage. What is the core message of this ad? The main visual is the pizza, symbolizing funds traveling the arteries passing through today\u2019s financial systems. The analogy of the pizza moving through the various stages and getting all those \u2018bites\u2019 by players representing the financial middlemen becomes a poignant symbol here. The art here is used to show the commission taken in each phase of a normal transaction. In the final scene, the pizza is delivered to a door with a \u2018surcharge\u2019 signage on it, which is a typical extra charge that comes with using credit card transactions. Another message follows from the delivery guy, who emphasizes the need for an updated system that is better, faster, and convenient. Perhaps through the cryptocurrency alternative, such a system should be the order of the day. The second part of the ad highlights the effectiveness and direct influence of crypto transactions on their traditional ways. Business philosophy and further goals Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad and VP of Engineering have both stated their objectives for the next set of commercials. They observed frequent beliefs among users that instant transactions occur through e-payments, such as credit card or Venmo applications. Nevertheless, these are an intricate part of a complex system that operates seamlessly with the digital interface considered as a whole. While cryptocurrency transactions are known for their simplicity, Coinbase\u2019s contrast helps to frame it as a leader in finance going forward. It underlines the value of consumers having their financial interactions without intermediaries as necessary, so transactions take place as quickly as the internet. Through this campaign, Coinbase keeps up with the improvement of public knowledge of how cryptocurrencies can work as a more convenient in the 21-st century alternative to traditional ways of money management.","article_summary":"U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is allegedly launching a nationwide mega ad campaign.

This speedier problem is handled based on data accumulation tendencies within the information technology and communication industry (ICT), where prices have decreased over time. Historical trends in the ICT sector The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has undergone a big shift in price reduction through the years, with a major decrease in the prices of the different components, with hardware, i.e., mobile phones, computers, and mobile communication, being a highlight. The decrease in chip price is due to leadership in the semiconductor manufacturing sector; this manufacturing directly follows Moore\u2019s law. Currently, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a downward trend in terms of pricing. A notable impact is the increasing affordability of PCs, tablets, and mobile phones for home users. This trend has been magnified and embraced by projects powered by free services such as open source or by other advertising-driven models; hence, it is no wonder that democracy has invaded technology, too. As more AIs are trained on microchips, pricing for semiconductor production will also be influenced, causing similar effects for AI overall. The fall in semiconductor prices might also be seen as the imminent decrease in AI infrastructure prices, leading to cheaper AI services for businesses and other consumers worldwide. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 turbo: A case in point By the end of November, the AI\u2019s OpenAI developers created GPT-4 Turbo, a model with a batch size of 128 people who can do the job of 512 people but at a very low cost compared to the preceding GPT-4. This decision of OpenAI represents one of the major trends in the market regarding the use of affordable AI systems to deliver products to customers. As with the GPT-4 Turbo\u2019s initial price, though it may have been set higher initially, it conforms to the broader trend of falling prices in parts of the ICT sector. Despite that, companies hold the enthusiasm and produce more advanced stuff even if they do not have a reduction in their price tags. In contrast, the announcement of the next release of a text-based AI tool called GPT-5, made by OpenAI in the summer of 2024, demonstrates the ever-changing nature of this tool. However, AI applications focus on more complex models that are also likely to be costly. They demonstrate the sustained investment in AI infrastructure and technology. Future outlook AI specialists continue to be confident about the presence of cost-effective AI services in the near future. With the declining costs of computing equipment and engineers optimizing AI algorithms, AI services will effectively reach a climax of becoming cheaper. Additionally, AI has become part of different industries that increase efficiency and automation and decrease the expenses connected with graphic user interface design, tech support, and financial division. A review of the IT industry\u2019s long-run trajectory and the recent innovations in AI technologies illustrate an AI future that is increasingly cost-competitive and widely accessible. Although OpenAI and other companies are more at the forefront of the battle with the use of cost-effective strategies, future research and advancements in semiconductor technology are also expected to lower costs to a considerable extent. As enterprises and individuals can use AI to solve sophisticated problems and ignite innovativeness, this is the initial step towards a more accessible future of technology among the people.

It sounds so chilling to hear something like this, along with a sudden feeling of anxiety and helplessness in the situation and the fact that you don\u2019t even know who stole your credentials. Things get muddier if the information stolen were your administrative credentials for your central cybersecurity system. As credential theft cases are increasing in number with insider based attacks, the infrastructure that protects your data is now the main target of hackers, as they are no longer just going after production or outer systems. According to a report, credential theft losses are estimated to be $20 billion in the US in 2023 and have affected 15.4 million folks. Source: Mcafee. Credential theft is not new Credential theft is not a new problem to break on our heads, it\u2019s been a problem for very long. Back in 2022, the BBC broke a story about a man in India who impersonated as the missing son of a landlord family in India. He deceived them for 41 years. Using their son\u2019s ID, the man got a national identity card, paid taxes, went to college, and even got a gun license. He also sold 37 acres of the family\u2019s property. Looking at the lucrative benefits, you now have an idea why impersonators do it in the first place. But the guy finally went to jail, so not everything that shines is gold. And yes, no online hackers were involved in this case. In this cyber age, no one is coming to break in, they don\u2019t even need to apply clever tricks and hacks, Just a password and a username, and the data is gone. Especially data admins in companies have become the primary target of impersonators. Artificial intelligence is also here to pour some fuel on the fire, as with its assistance, hackers can design more sophisticated approaches to attack and deploy them more efficiently. It can be anything like some phishing schemes based on generative AI, some new tricks of impersonation, or using deep fakes, but convincing the victim by luring them into something is the most favorite and easy way of getting credentials as you hand them over unintentionally. Remember the news when a British Parliamentarian provided the phone numbers and email addresses of his colleagues to a honey trapper? Source: techtarget. Cost of cybercrime Coming to our core topic, with most of our data now available online, from healthcare databases to dating sites that your wife may not know, securing all this is important. Nowadays, hackers are after passwords, names, and financial records, which they may use themselves or sell on the dark web. Supply chain attacks are perhaps the biggest in the history of cyberattacks in recent years. Gartner, which is an analyst firm, has said that by 2025, 45% of organizations will be impacted in one way or another by supply chain attacks globally. According to US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, Anne Neuberger, the average cybercrime cost annually is expected to be more than $23 trillion for the year 2027. It is to be mentioned that just a year ago, in 2022, the figure was $8.4 trillion. A Verizon report named \u201c2023 Data Breach Investigation Report\u201d mentions that the human factor is the most prevalent threat vector and the reason for 74% of cases of data breach. Humans are also behind stealing credentials and phishing attacks. The latter one is mostly carried out through emails in hopes that someone will provide information or at least click a link that can lead to further misuse. The consequences of cyberattacks on businesses can last for years from the time they were first initiated. For a clear understanding, take into account criminal investigations, lawsuits, media backlash, and increases in insurance rates, altogether, these elements can bankrupt any firm.

This apology came just days before his sentencing, scheduled for April 30, following a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice in late 2023. Despite previously waiving his right to appeal any sentence under 18 months, the Department of Justice is now pushing for a three-year term. Zhao\u2019s letter to Judge Richard A. Jones of the Western District of Washington openly admits his failure to implement crucial compliance measures at Binance and promises that this legal trouble will be his last. Furthermore, Zhao outlines his future intentions, which include supporting biotechnological innovations and youth initiatives. His plea was accompanied by 161 letters from various supporters, advocating for leniency due to his character and contributions. Zhao\u2019s Wide Circle of Support The range of individuals backing Zhao is extensive. His sister, Jessica Zhao, a former Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, commended him for his ongoing efforts to do good despite his errors. She highlighted his prudent management during the FTX crisis to ensure that Binance never misappropriated customer funds. Yi He, a co-founder of Binance and the mother of Zhao\u2019s three children, compared him to a \u201cguardian of the wilderness\u201d in the chaotic cryptocurrency industry. CZ\u2019s wife, Yang Weiqing, with whom he shares two children, cited their philanthropic efforts, including a substantial donation to Japan\u2019s disaster-affected areas in 2018. His US-based university student children, Rachel and Ryan Zhao, portrayed him as a supportive father, urging the judge to view their father beyond this solitary incident. From within the academic industry, Zhao received backing from Professor Jeremy R. Cooperstock of McGill University and Associate Professor Ronghui Gu of Columbia University, both highlighting his contributions to technology and innovation. Further support came from Tigran Gambaryan, Head of Financial Crime Compliance at Binance, who despite being detained in Nigeria due to a separate issue, spoke highly of Zhao\u2019s business acumen and philanthropic efforts. U.S. figures like former Senator and Ambassador Max S. Baucus, and business leaders like Morgan Stanley Managing Director Sean Yang, also submitted letters vouching for Zhao\u2019s character and professional integrity. Even members of the ruling family in the United Arab Emirates provided their endorsements, reflecting Zhao\u2019s broad and positive impact on a global scale. Legal Arguments and Defense Strategy Zhao\u2019s legal team is strongly defending his unawareness of any illegal transactions on his platform, highlighting that these transactions were a minuscule fraction of the exchange\u2019s total activity and therefore unlikely to have been deliberately facilitated by him. They argue for probation, citing his non-repetitive breach and lack of prior knowledge about the specific illegalities. The defense also emphasized the international aspect of Binance\u2019s operations, explaining that as a non-U.S. entity, Binance was not barred from servicing users in U.S.-sanctioned countries. This point underscores the novel legal challenge Binance faces, where its automated systems inadvertently enabled transactions between these users and those in the U.S., a scenario not previously adjudicated. In their plea agreement, Zhao and Binance consented to severe consequences beyond potential prison time. Binance has agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine and will operate under a court-appointed monitor, a position yet to be filled. The legal proceedings have affected Zhao\u2019s personal life big time. Originally slated for sentencing in late February, the proceedings were delayed until April 30. Since appearing in court in Seattle, Zhao has been blocked from returning to Dubai, where he lives with his family. Throughout the defense filings, Zhao was described as being uninformed of the transactions involving criminal funds, directly challenging the idea that he deliberately engaged in sanction violations. The sanctions-related charge, a narrow and first-time application against Binance, claimed that an algorithmic matching engine unknowingly breached U.S. sanctions law by pairing users from sanctioned countries with U.S. users, a minute part of Binance\u2019s trading volume.","article_summary":"Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, has officially apologized for his past decisions in a comprehensive letter to the judge overseeing his trial.

This choice is now becoming a strategic milestone in enterprise building, with the aim of improving digital integration and hand tool availability worldwide. Broadening horizons Chats such as Nigeria will now be available in Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with Meta thus extending its footprint across Africa. Our expansion also includes additional countries outside the continent, such as Canada, Australia, Jamaica, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Singapore. The service is initially in English since it is all about improving users\u2019 experience by offering a plethora of creative, productive, and simple information-capturing tools to be used directly within Facebook\u2019s core of services apps. By employing the high-performance Meta Llama 3 tech stack, Meta AI promotes itself as a highly sophisticated instrument compatible with the user\u2019s routine availability and other daily digital activities. The statement assumes that this is only a preliminary phase of delivering brand-new AI features to the world population. When Meta AI was first introduced at last year\u2019s Connect event, it turned into a really powerful platform with many functions end users can use without much effort. Enhancing App Performance with Meta AI Meta\u2019s blog post announces that the AI service can be used between apps and will boost the apps\u2019 performance by letting users search, chat, and discover personalized feeds without leaving the app. The integration is proposed to be seamless in that the AI uses current information instantly and can make adjustments depending on the user\u2019s input and situations. For the next couple of years, our primary concern is to expand our product portfolio with products that cater to a wide range of potential customers. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, expressed strong excitement about this enlargement. He said that the technology could supply everyone with top-notch AI and make their interaction even more fun by showing existing news and creative tools in real-time. Smooth photo animation and AI proficiency in generating top-quality pictures in real time are some of the key features that make this AI unique. Expanding global access to innovative AI tools The Llama-3 AI model, which is the basis of Meta AI, will be released as public code. Regarding Zuckerberg\u2019s declaration, it was essential to stress the new Meta AI commitment to innovation. In this way, this opportunity is open to various majors, such as wiring and its uses for homes and businesses, cabling from industrial machinery to developed tools, and data transfer. The Meta AI, Meta Platforms, has also introduced this service in different countries, symbolizing its rising efforts to ensure that social media and digital platforms advance beyond what people have envisioned. Meta is planning to use technology to make widely accessible powerful AI tools that assist user interaction across its global network so that machines are not only the tools of interaction but also a marshaling implement for a greater community and productivity. Expansion is obviously evidence of Meta\u2019s strategic priority to link users deeper with the company\u2019s platforms; thus, the platforms have become a necessity for daily digital interactions.

The spokesman said that the gang planned the events, and their middlemen, where the drug smugglers, used the women\u2019s menstruation sanitary products to secretly sneak in drug packages.

Private Joe Kelly and Dhruv Bansal started Unchained with one main objective: to provide financial services to people like themselves \u2014 long-term bitcoin holders. Since 2017, when Unchained launched its first product, a lending desk that allowed customers to borrow US dollars against their bitcoin, the company has developed into a full-on financial services company for Bitcoiners who value holding their private keys. Unchained now offers a suite of services and products, including multsig vaults for both individuals and businesses, a bitcoin trading desk, a bitcoin IRA and inheritance planning for bitcoin. Where Unchained really shines, though, is not just in how it helps clients safely secure their bitcoin, but in how it guides them through the process of doing so. It has a Concierge Onboarding team that walks clients through the often vulnerable process of setting up a multisig vault. \u201cWe really like being a navigator,\u201d Kelly told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe\u2019re not authoritative, like \u2018You should do that.\u2019 We\u2019re the guide. We\u2019re here to help show you \u2018Here\u2019s a map. Here\u2019s a couple of trails you could take up the mountain. Pick your way, and if you need somebody to be your sherpa up one of these trails, we\u2019ll do that for you.\u2019\u201d I sat down with Kelly to learn more about the philosophy that underpins Unchained\u2019s approach, the company\u2019s history and how it\u2019s established itself as one of the most trusted financial service providers in the Bitcoin space. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: How did you and your co-founder Dhruv Bansal meet? Joe Kelly: Craigslist. I was an undergraduate college dropout looking for my next opportunities, and Dhruv was in grad school. His department, the physics department, was looking for a new website. They posted the gig like, \u201cHey, come build a website.\u201d I was like, \u201cMaybe I want to start a web development firm.\u201d So, I came in to meet him at the center for nonlinear dynamics, which is chaos theory. I told Dhruv I'd always been hyper curious about this field of study. That's been an enduring part of our relationship, our shared curiosity about complexity science. We started building the company after that. Corva: So, you\u2019re an autodidact. Are you the type that will seek out mentors or do you just read everything you can find on a topic until you understand it thoroughly? Kelly: It's a mix. Like a lot of humans, I can just go with intuition versus deriving knowledge from a book. I wish I\u2019d had more mentors. Over the last decade plus, I\u2019ve been thrown into the deep end of being a CEO. I've had to learn a lot on the job. Corva: What have been some of the hurdles that you\u2019ve surmounted with Unchained since you founded it in 2016? Kelly: One of the things that excited me most with Unchained early was that it felt like a very contrarian bet in a couple ways. Back in 2016, all the VC funding was about \u201cWe're not sure about this Bitcoin thing, but blockchain is the real technology.\u201d But Dhruv and I looked at people like us that held bitcoin for the long term and felt that we were the customer we wanted to serve: the long-term bitcoin holder had sort of no financial services advocate for them, no trusted institution that worked with them in a healthy way. Then it was feedback like, \u201cWell, what about these other coins? Or why don't you lend out the bitcoin like BlockFi is doing and increase your revenues?\u201d Saying no to those things was also contrarian. Principally, we said, \u201cNo, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is it. Bitcoin is enough.\u201d The idea of lending out bitcoin was popular, but I\u2019m really grateful we didn't do that. Otherwise, we would have risked our fate like everyone else. We were willing to be unpopular, stand alone and be underfunded compared to competitors for a lot of our early history. That changed, thankfully, with partnerships like NYDIG, who led our series A in 2021. That put us more on the map of having money, having resources and looking like we knew all along that we were going to be right. Corva: So, is the long-term bitcoin holder the typical Unchained user? Kelly: Yeah, that core sweet spot is that the individual long-term bitcoin holder who gravitates to self-custody because they're already doing it or wants to work with somebody that helps them feel comfortable doing it. Now, some of our core sweet spots are those people's businesses or their trusts. Unchained is one of the few places that enables you to onboard a trust while you can still hold your keys. It's not like you give them up to some third-party custodian to get those benefits. Corva: Which products are currently your most popular? Kelly: Unchained Vault is the bread and butter product that most every client uses. 95% of all clients have a vault that's either a personal or business account. More than a third of our clients have IRAs with us now. That's been one of our faster growing product lines over the last year or two. Loans are taken by some percentage of clients, but not everyone. Trading really couples well with a vault. Increasingly, a bigger portion of the client base uses our trading desk, as well. Click the image to get $100 off Unchained IRA. Corva: When I think of Unchained\u2019s approach, the two words that come to mind are \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201cservice.\u201d You have a concierge service to help onboard clients and I\u2019ve heard you talk about how important security is when it comes to storing the bitcoin that clients lend to you. Did you know that security and service would be at the center of what you do since the beginning? Kelly: Security was there at the foundation early on. And I was on the front lines answering customer inquiries in our first year or two. We had a culture of really taking care of clients as much as possible when our main product was lending. As we launched the vault product in 2019, part of what unlocked that product for us was the Concierge Onboarding product, which brings clients through the process of initializing the hardware wallets and getting set up with the multisig vault. That interaction is led by someone on our team, which is a big trust building opportunity. While someone is making a backup of their private key in a live session \u2014 off camera, of course \u2014 going through those really vulnerable, private steps of initializing [their multsig vault], they've got an Unchained representative on the other side coaching them through it, answering any questions and making them feel comfortable. So, yeah, I think you nailed it when you said that security and service come together at Unchained. Corva: Do you find it harder to convince people to use Unchained now that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are live and more convenient investment vehicles? Kelly: The ETF does a great job in growing overall awareness for Bitcoin, creating more legitimacy around the asset for those that might have been on the fence. We haven't seen it cloud or affect our client onboarding funnel. That still runs at a full pace like it was pre-ETF and has even been accelerated since the ETFs launched earlier this year. One of the most effective elements of our sales approach is the army of Bitcoiners out there that don't work at Unchained but encourage everyone to practice self custody. People sometimes come to us because they feel the peer pressure of \u201cHey, you know, I've been going to Bitcoin meetups, and I know I need to get my base for self custody.\u201d Also, over the last two years, the median age of our clients has gone up. More members of the Boomer generation have been holding bitcoin. Maybe they're two or three years into the space after buying in 2020-21 and like \u201cAlright, now I'm ready to do this. I've been through the trough and some of the peak and I'm going to hold this for a decade or more. Let me finally get self custody figured out.\u201d Corva: It sounds like you\u2019re quite in touch with what customers want. I\u2019ve also read that you pay close attention to customer feedback and factor it into your approach at Unchained. Can you give an example of a product you\u2019ve created based on customer feedback? Kelly: One example is last year in Q4 we launched Sound Advisory, which is our Registered Investment Advisor affiliate. The thinking behind that came out of customers that would come in for a Concierge Onboarding and talk to one of our frontline people. One of the last questions they would ask was, \u201cDo you know anybody that can give me financial advice for my bitcoin? I can't talk to my traditional financial advisor, but I'm nearing retirement age and I'm thinking about when I might want to sell some bitcoin or whether I want to get a loan against my bitcoin.\u201d People want to think through those decisions practically. The awful reality for a lot of people is you can't talk to your financial advisor, you've got to hide this part of your portfolio. They're not going to be philosophically aligned with you. It\u2019s really difficult when you don\u2019t have that alignment with somebody who should be such a trusted advisor. Corva: I know that feeling. What else have you learned from your customers over the years? Kelly: Something we've seen at Unchained, having been around for eight years now, is how Bitcoin adoption happens in the wake of macro geopolitical events or things that wake people up like, \u201cHey, it's not actually my money at the bank.\u201d Also, people learn from things like the Canadian trucker protest where they saw that you can lose access to your dollars if you believe in certain things. Then we had the failures of SVB and First Republic last year. What we've created at Unchained is really kind of an antifragile set of products and services that aligns with core tenets and the core philosophy of Bitcoin. That means that when a lot of those bad things happen, we see influxes of clients. I'm immensely proud of what the team has done here in terms of helping thousands of people get into a really comfortable position with assets outside of the traditional financial system and outside of systems that [are prone to] centralized risks of seizure or control over their bitcoin. Unchained has over 7,000 clients that secure over 90,000 bitcoin with 12,000 keys. In four years, maybe that\u2019s 100,000 keys securing tens of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. I think that'll be a really unique financial institution that couldn't have existed before. And our goal is to do that profitably in a way where we're around as long as possible but also that's going to be a net good for society, the industry and ecosystem overall. Corva: I give you an immense amount of credit for not underestimating the user. What you're doing with Unchained is saying, \u201cWe're going to give you the full Bitcoin experience.\u201d At the same time, you\u2019re a financial services company and can play the TradFi game. It\u2019s great for people who are more familiar with traditional finance, but who want to understand bitcoin and what makes it different from traditional assets or investments. Kelly: It's a model and an attitude that's in contrast to the classic Wall Street attitude, which looks for \u201cHow do I get your money over here so I can make more money?\u201d There's obviously a version of that's not always just in the client's interest. We\u2019re the [opposite]. We\u2019re trying to do business transparently \u2014 literally transparently on the blockchain \u2014 and as a company. Corva: It\u2019s apparent that you're playing a long game, because your clients are going to have this experience with Unchained that\u2019s different from the experience they have with traditional financial institutions, and they\u2019re going to tell their friends about Unchained. Kelly: It goes back to your ETF question. You may buy some shares in the ETF as your first exposure to bitcoin, but you're only partially converted at that point. The full conversion happens when you've taken your sacrament of sending bitcoin with a hardware wallet. That\u2019s a key part of the journey.","article_summary":"Joe Kelly, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin financial services platform Unchained, is determined to give users a true Bitcoin experience, while still meeting them where they\u2019re at.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-is-helping-users-secure-90000-btc-and-counting-in-self-custody","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-24T20:26:38Z","categories":["unchained capital","business","unchained","cold storage","bitcoin ira","multisig"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-is-helping-users-secure-90000-btc-and-counting-in-self-custody","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ2NzY5NjU2MjU5ODYy/unchained_joe-kelly_article_preview.jpg"},{"article_title":"Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs to Trade on 30th April: HashKey Capital","author":"Vivek Sen","article_detailed_content":"Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission recently approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs for several major asset managers, paving the way for the city to become a leading hub for such products.

If you\u2019ve been using bitcoin for a while, you\u2019ve probably noticed that some bitcoin addresses appear quite different from others. You may have also seen discussion around several acronyms beginning with \u201cP2,\u201d such as P2PKH or P2WSH. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with what these acronyms mean, here we\u2019ll look through all the standardized on-chain methods for receiving bitcoin throughout its history and explain some essential differences that make each method unique. P2PK Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) is the original method of receiving bitcoin, and it does not involve an address. Instead, as the name suggests, bitcoin is paid directly to an exposed public key. The first ever bitcoin transaction from one person to another used P2PK, when Satoshi Nakamoto sent coins to Hal Finney in Block 170. P2PK is no longer used because it is a more expensive, less private, and less secure way of receiving bitcoin than subsequent methods. Quick facts P2PKH Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) was available for use at bitcoin\u2019s beginning, and it showed up on the blockchain for the first time less than two weeks after the genesis block. P2PKH makes several improvements upon P2PK, such as utilizing an address. As discussed in our earlier article, addresses contain a checksum that helps prevent typos and lost bitcoin. P2PKH addresses are typically 34 or 33 characters in length (but could theoretically be as short as 26 characters), and they are encoded in Base58 format. They begin with a prefix of 1 and are currently responsible for receiving and securing 43% of the mined bitcoin supply, more than any other address type.

Creating a P2PKH address involves putting a single public key through hash functions SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. This shortens the amount of data, which in turn helps save block space and transaction fees for the user. It also introduces further resistance to reverse-engineering the private key beyond the already believed-to-be-unbreakable secp256k1 elliptic curve. Quick facts P2MS Pay-to-Multisig (P2MS) is a trivial transaction type that was only briefly relevant and has never been responsible for holding more than 100 bitcoin at one time across all network participants. Nevertheless, P2MS is a part of bitcoin\u2019s history. P2MS was introduced as a standard script in early 2012, as specified by BIP 11. However, this transaction type suffered from the same problems as P2PK since it included exposed public keys and did not use any address format. It also limited the number of public keys in a multisig quorum to three. Within months P2MS would be replaced by an alternative method for receiving bitcoin into a multisig arrangement called P2SH, which we will cover next. Quick facts P2SH Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) was introduced to bitcoin as a soft fork in accordance with BIP 16 on April 1, 2012. Like most forks, the story behind it is fascinating. P2SH shares a lot in common with P2PKH. The main difference is that the address is created by hashing a redeem script instead of hashing a single public key. A redeem script can be thought of as coded instructions specifying how bitcoin received to the P2SH address can be spent in the future. There could be a wide range of possibilities, including multiple different public keys. The receiver, not the sender, determines the script details, and the spending instructions are not exposed publicly until bitcoin is spent out of the address. While advanced users can construct complex scripts, the most common uses for P2SH have been to create Nested SegWit addresses (covered below) and multisig wallets. For example, a script can include three public keys and specify that signatures from any two of the corresponding private keys can spend the bitcoin. This would create a 2-of-3 multisig address.

P2SH addresses are exactly 34 characters in length, and they begin with a prefix of 3, as specified by BIP 13. Before the soft fork on April 1st, a handful of transactions experimented with this alternative prefix, the first of which is found in Block 170,052. Quick facts P2WPKH Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) is the first of two address types introduced to bitcoin upon the SegWit soft fork in August 2017. The story behind this extremely important and particularly contentious soft fork is documented in a book called The Blocksize War, written by Jonathan Bier. P2WPKH is the SegWit variant of P2PKH, which at a basic level, means that choosing this address type rather than older P2PKH addresses will help you save money on transaction fees when moving your bitcoin around. SegWit addresses look quite different from the older address types because, per BIP 173, they use Bech32 encoding instead of Base58. Most notably, there are no capital letters in Bech32. P2WPKH addresses can be identified by a prefix of bc1q and a character length of exactly 42. Quick facts P2WSH Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) is the SegWit variant of P2SH. The main advantage to using P2WSH over P2SH is that it can help lower transaction fees, and the primary reason to use a script hash instead of a public key hash is to accommodate multisig arrangements. Like P2WPKH, a P2WSH address begins with a prefix of bc1q. However, it has a longer character length of exactly 62. Unlike the address types covered thus far, P2WSH addresses are created using the SHA-256 hashing function alone, without including RIPEMD-160, resulting in the increased character length. This was implemented cautiously, adding extra protection from a fairly nuanced and extremely unlikely multisig attack vector. Quick facts Nested SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH) Nested SegWit (also known as Wrapped SegWit) is technically not a different address type than we\u2019ve covered above. Still, it is a unique way to use previously discussed address types in a manner that was temporarily useful for the bitcoin community. When the SegWit soft-fork occurred, not all bitcoin nodes, software, and services immediately upgraded to support the new Native SegWit address types, P2WPKH and P2WSH. Only the entities that did upgrade could send to these new addresses. This meant that folks who wanted the ability to receive bitcoin from anybody (including those who hadn\u2019t upgraded) couldn\u2019t use a Native SegWit wallet yet. However, since SegWit offered cheaper transaction fees, most people were keen to begin using it. The crafty solution to this dilemma was to utilize the P2SH transaction type. The entities that had not yet implemented SegWit could still send bitcoin to P2SH addresses\u2014which, as discussed above, are built with a redeem script specifying the instructions on how the bitcoin can be spent later on. As it turns out, these instructions could incorporate the new SegWit spending model, providing users with a bridge to reduced fees. Therefore, the P2SH addresses using this trick became known as Nested SegWit, and they played a significant role in the SegWit adoption process. On the surface, Nested SegWit addresses are indistinguishable from other P2SH addresses, so the supply of bitcoin held in this arrangement is unknowable. Additionally, since all modern bitcoin tools can now send directly to Native SegWit addresses, there is no longer any good reason to use Nested SegWit. Quick facts P2TR Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) is the newest address type, made available by the Taproot soft-fork in November 2021. P2TR adoption remains quite low at the time of writing, and many bitcoin softwares and services are still working on integration. While P2WPKH and P2WSH are known as SegWit V0, P2TR is considered SegWit V1. Notably, P2TR utilizes a digital signature algorithm called Schnorr, which differs from the ECDSA format used in earlier bitcoin transaction types. Schnorr signatures have several advantages, including additional transaction fee reductions and increased privacy. Regarding privacy, the key and signature aggregations made possible by Schnorr allow multisig addresses to be indistinguishable from singlesig, and the full spending conditions for a P2TR address are not necessarily revealed publicly. The creator of the address can even include multiple customized redeem scripts to choose from in order to spend the bitcoin later. P2TR addresses are 62 characters long, and they use Bech32m encoding, a slightly modified version of Bech32, as described in BIP 350. P2TR addresses can be identified by their unique bc1p prefix.

It's often claimed that the Bitcoin network offers levels of decentralization, accessibility, and distribution unmatched by any other cryptocurrency. But just how decentralized is Bitcoin in reality? And how do we go about measuring its decentralization? Before delving into these questions, it's crucial to clarify the concepts of centralization and decentralization, as they are often muddled. To provide a clear definition, the centralization/decentralization dynamic can be understood as the degree of concentration/diffusion of authority among the participants in a system. Here, \"authority\" refers to the power to influence the functioning and rules of the system, whether for malicious or benign purposes. With this in mind, measuring the degree of centralization in a system involves quantifying the minimum number of entities, participants, required to alter its functioning or rules. The lower this number, the greater the degree of centralization. In a seminal 2017 paper on the subject, Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland Lee introduced an insightful metric for this purpose: the Nakamoto coefficient. Derived from the Lorenz curve used in calculating the Gini coefficient, the Nakamoto coefficient identifies the minimum number of participants necessary to compromise or control the system. For instance, in the well-known scenario of Bitcoin's hashrate, if we assume that five mining pools collectively possess 50%+1 of the total hashrate, then this number would be five. This means that a simple majority of 50% of the hashrate would be adequate to execute a double spending operation on the blockchain. However, the critical threshold may vary for other variables. Different facets of centralization Now, let's address the core issue identified by the authors of the paper: identifying subsystems critical to the functioning of the system. When it comes to Bitcoin, focusing solely on the concentration of hashrate (i.e., miners) fails to capture the full spectrum of centralization/decentralization within the network and overlooks the potential for a 50%+1 attack. Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland Lee, in their article, propose five additional measurable subsystems of the Bitcoin Network: client platform, code developers, nodes, custodial/exchanges, and ownership. According to Balaji S. Srinivasan, the six dimensions of centralization within the Bitcoin network are as follows: \u2022 Client centralization \u2022 Ownership centralization \u2022 Node centralization \u2022 Developers centralization \u2022 Custodial/exchanges centralization \u2022 Hashrate centralization In addition, we might consider adding one last dimension: Hardware Centralization While this list is comprehensive, what's lacking is a qualitative assessment of these dimensions. Which among them are truly pivotal for Bitcoin's network functionality, and which are not? For instance, one could argue that the client or ownership variables aren't as crucial in measuring Bitcoin's decentralization. In the first case, Bitcoin Core stands as the de facto standard client today. However, it's worth noting that this is an open-source software authored by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. As long as it remains open-source, actively maintained, and monitored, its dominance doesn't necessarily equate to vulnerability. It's important to recognize the distinction between Bitcoin Core's hegemony rather than a monopoly, as theoretically, other operational clients exist\u2014such as Bitcoin Knots, BTCD, Libbitcoin, BitcoinJ, Bitcoin Unlimited, Gocoin\u2014that can support the Bitcoin protocol. Yet, in practice, very few network nodes utilize these alternatives, favoring Nakamoto's original implementation. In this regard, in 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto himself said: \"I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.\" Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 2 As for the second dimension listed above - the distribution of Bitcoin ownership - this undoubtedly has significant socio-economic implications but it doesn't directly affect Bitcoin's infrastructure. Since Bitcoin relies on a proof-of-work algorithm, the power that Bitcoin owners have over nodes and protocol operation is essentially nil. The centralization of sat ownership could only become problematic if currency concentration reaches such extreme levels that undermine the network effect, impacting practical use as a medium of exchange and store of value. Fortunately, as polarized as Bitcoin wealth may be, we are far from this point and according to various analyses, as Bitcoin adoption increases, the concentration of sats gradually decreases. Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 3 Conversely, subsystems like nodes and coding are pivotal for achieving true network decentralization, being potentially the most critical points within the Bitcoin system. The risk of node takeover and subsequent hard forks or coordinated malicious actions on the protocol poses significant and lasting threats to network trust. However, the probability of such occurrences is already low and have constantly decreased over time, given the growing number of active or quickly activatable nodes (approximately 16 thousand and 53 thousand respectively, according to the latest known data) and their distribution across different locations, entities, and legal jurisdictions. Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 5 In the latter case, the concentration of Bitcoin Core code developers - the so-called Core developers and maintainers - remains very high and arguably increasing from a certain perspective: there are relatively few programmers actively involved in writing and maintaining the client despite it being a critical function for the entire technological infrastructure of the Bitcoin network. As of today, on average, between 40 and 60 developers contribute to this task each month with commits according to GitHub data. They decide voluntarily and independently when and how to contribute to the development of Bitcoin Core software on GitHub. In practice, over the years, there has been a rather high turnover within this community of developers: it includes both historical developers dating back to the early versions of Bitcoin Core and many newcomers who have joined more recently. Many historical figures have left over the years, while others have re-aggregated later, some operate consistently and regularly, others in a limited and sporadic manner. Within this group, which does not have a formalized hierarchy (and how could it, being Bitcoin an open-source project?), there are even fewer key developers, those who pull the strings of the community's work. According to GitHub data, from its beginnings, 30% of the known commits to the Bitcoin Core master repository were made by only 2 developers, and in particular, almost 25% (meaning 7347 out of a total of 29,822 detected commits) by Wladimir van der Laan alone, the former Bitcoin's Lead Maintainer. After his departure in 2022, there has not been a single coordinator of work on the Bitcoin Core code, but his enormous contribution remains undisputed. As of today, guiding the work on Bitcoin Core development is a restrictive leadership made up of a few senior developers including Gennady Stepanov, Michael Ford, Ava Chow, and Gloria Zhao, each specializing in overseeing a specific component of the client.\" One might wonder if such a small and decentralized group of developers/maintainers contributing to the code today might be the Achilles' heel among Bitcoin's various subsystems, making the entire structure vulnerable to attack. A huge, complex, and highly valuable (not only economically) infrastructure like today's Bitcoin network relies on the often part-time and mostly unpaid work of a few passionate supporters and maintainers. On the one hand, it's true that individual nodes have the final say on the adoption of each new update/version of the Bitcoin Core client through the consensus mechanism. On the other hand, one might question how many nodes actually analyze the new code for vulnerabilities, harmful changes, or bugs before installing it. What would happen if, hypothetically, gradual infiltrations of saboteurs occurred within the limited circle of Key Core developers and Maintainers, with the aim of first gaining trust and influence in the community and then hacking the new versions of the code? They could, for example, hide virtual time bombs within them (in the form of bugs or zero-day vulnerabilities). It's a Machiavellian and complex hypothesis to execute, but not impossible, especially if we consider a gradual, covert operation conducted by entities with significant financial, human, and technological resources at their disposal and with a strong motivation to disrupt the network, such as the intelligence service of a powerful state. What would be the consequences of such an operation on Bitcoin if it were successful? Probably quite serious, if not existential. It could unleash chaos among nodes that unwittingly implemented the corrupted update, leading to forced hard forks with effects on the stability, integrity, and trust in the Bitcoin network. What a technological brute force attack couldn't accomplish, social engineering aimed at dismantling consensus could. It's difficult to estimate the probability of success of such an attack on the Bitcoin Core code, but the small number of individuals overseeing its development and maintenance, and the relative lack of interest from the wider user community in their valuable work (and, last but not least, their remuneration), make this subsystem particularly vulnerable to a well-conceived attack. Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 4 When considering the realm of custodial and exchange services, the trend toward greater or lesser centralization isn't entirely clear-cut. While their numbers have soared since the early days of Bitcoin (think MtGOX), the lion's share of trading volumes against fiat currencies today remains concentrated among a select few major players (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, Kraken, Bitfinex, etc.). Specifically, as of today, three major entities hold more than 55% of the Bitcoin held in custody by third parties, while just Binance rules the volume of fiat-BTC transactions with 30% of total public exchanges. The risks stemming from excessive centralization in this specific subsystem aren't so much tied to the security of the Bitcoin network itself, but rather to its convertibility with fiat currencies and the security of those delegating custody (i.e., all those Bitcoin users entrusting their sats and hence their \"physical\" possession). In the first scenario, heightened centralization (a reduction in the number of exchanges) would render the system more vulnerable to coordinated legal or cyberattacks aimed at disrupting and potentially severing the link between fiat currencies and Bitcoin. This follows the logic that fewer doors make for easier locking. In the second scenario, under an oligopolistic regime, those opting for custodial solutions instead of self-custody would face increased counterparty risk. This would result from the diminished bargaining power of users towards custodial counterparts, who could then impose more burdensome economic conditions and more oppressive clauses (for example, regarding access to custodied bitcoins) than they could in a competitive environment. Moreover, with only a few large operators capable of controlling significant bitcoin quantities on behalf of their clients, the risk of abuses (such as non-consensual fractional reserve practices), hacking (the richer the target, the more appealing), and political-regulatory interference (including collusion with public authorities, excessive regulation, and bureaucratization) would be considerably higher compared to a more fragmented and competitive custodial system. At the far end of this counterparty risk spectrum lies the possibility of a 6102 attack: the large-scale seizure of bitcoins held on exchanges and custodial wallets within a certain jurisdiction by legislative action. While this wouldn't directly impact the functioning of the Bitcoin network, it would likely undermine trust in Bitcoin as a secure means of payment and store of value among the general public, thereby jeopardizing its success as a free permissionless currency. Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 3 We won't dwell much on the hashrate/mining subsystem as both the issue of its decentralization and the possibility of 51% attacks have been analyzed and dissected countless times by far more authoritative sources. We only recall here the most common attack scenarios: double spending attack, selective transaction censorship, and empty block attack. The consequences of such attacks could be awful and should not be underestimated, but there is a vast literature explaining the limitations of this type of attack and the countermeasures that could be adopted by the node consensus to thwart it or at least effectively counteract it. However, all in all, it remains one of the most delicate and vulnerable subsystems, if only due to its degree of centralization. In fact, two mining pools \u2013 Foundry USA and Antpool \u2013 currently control more than 50% of the hash rate. Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 4 Finally, turning to the hardware dimension (originally absent in the work of Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland), we need to analyze the diversification of mining equipment in terms of manufacturers, models, and their respective market shares of Bitcoin's hashrate. It's undeniable that nowadays the number of hardware manufacturers for mining (ASICs) has significantly increased compared to the past. Major companies in the sector include Bitmain, Whatsminer, Canaan, Zhejiang Ebang Communication, Halong Mining, Helium, Bitfury, Bee Computing, and HIVE Blockchain. However, the total hashrate of miners is currently dominated by a few ASIC models and even fewer manufacturers. According to recent estimates by Coinmetrics, over 70% of the global hashrate is produced by ASICs from a single leading company, Bitmain. Additionally, including just three other manufacturers (Whatsminer, Canaan, and Ebang) accounts for virtually all of the computational power used by the Bitcoin network. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of the hashrate is generated by only seven ASIC models from these aforementioned companies: Antminer S19xp, Antminer S19jpro, Antminer S19, Canaan 1246, Antminer S17, MicroBT m20s, and MicroBT m32. The risks of such centralization of hardware in terms of models and manufacturers are numerous. With very few large manufacturers, primarily now located in China, they could easily be compelled by governments and lawmakers of the jurisdictions they're subject to, to halt production in their facilities, hand over batches of manufactured hardware, or secretly infiltrate backdoor hardware and trojans into their ASIC models. The consequences would immediately impact the mining subsystem, causing instability and potentially a collapse in the network's hashrate, resulting in significant economic losses for miners using corrupted ASICs or those unable to acquire new ones. A significantly lower and prolonged hashrate would reduce the security of the entire network, as it would increase the chances of a 51% attack, perhaps precisely by the actor who initiated the hardware attack. Here, we see how an attack on one poorly decentralized subsystem can virtually weaken another and thus attack it in a dangerous chain reaction with dangerous consequences for the integrity of the Bitcoin network. Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 3 Given this non-exhaustive overview of the various subsystems of Bitcoin and their vulnerabilities, we can endeavor to synthesize the six dimensions into a single table. This table would measure the risk of centralization as a matrix between probability (P) and damage incidence (D, i.e.: the relevance of effects on the network), illustrating the dynamics toward increasing or decreasing centralization. A probability score (P) is assigned on a scale from 1 to 5 based on an inverse and non-linear function of the number of entities required to reach a given critical centralization threshold. In other words, the greater the number of existing entities required to reach a certain threshold, the lower the probability score. The aforementioned threshold is a percentage (sometimes subjectively defined) of the total estimated number of entities participating in a given subsystem, beyond which the system becomes seriously vulnerable to compromise. In some cases, this threshold is objective, as in the case of the mining dimension, while in others it is more arbitrary, such as in the case of developers or the client; however, in general, it could be understood as the tipping point of centralization. A damage variable (D) is also assigned a score from 1 to 5. This is attributed in relation to the negative consequences expected from an attack on the specific subsystem on the security, stability, and functionality of the Bitcoin network as a whole. This latter score is obviously subjective and undoubtedly could be subject to criticism and subsequent revisions by more in-depth analyses. Finally, the specific risk score, which summarizes the risk of centralization of each subsystem, is obtained from the product of these two scores. Geographical and Economic Decentralization Other variations of the decentralization/centralization dichotomy can be identified, which cut across the seven types just illustrated: geographical (jurisdictions) and economic (economic entities). Geographical decentralization addresses the question: where are the nodes, wallets, exchanges/custodians, and miners physically and legally located? Economic decentralization, on the other hand, concerns the economic ownership of these entities: for example, who owns the mining pools? Or who controls the exchanges? The geographical and economic aspects may seem overlapping at first glance, but in reality, they are not at all. For instance, there could be a Bitcoin ecosystem where there are many independent miners, but all located within the same jurisdiction and thus subject to the same political-legal risk. Here, economic/ownership centralization would be low, while geographical centralization would be very high. Conversely, there could be many miner factories scattered across the globe but controlled by the same economic entity and therefore effectively considered as a single point of failure. The same argument could equally apply to nodes, hardware or bitcoin ownership. In a world dominated by states and large corporations, neglecting these factors can be fatal. The mere number of participants in a Bitcoin subsystem tells us little about decentralization if they are mostly concentrated in a single jurisdiction or subject to the same economic control. Therefore, both the qualitative geographical parameter and the economic parameter should be integrated into any attempt to measure the degree of decentralization of the Bitcoin network. What changes with ETFs? The recent emergence of Bitcoin ETFs in the US market may have a considerable impact on the decentralization of the network, particularly concerning the Custodial/Exchanges subsystem. While investing in an ETF significantly simplifies access to bitcoin performance compared to other fiduciary solutions, this option doubles (if not triples) the counterparty risks for investors. Those who \"invest in bitcoin\" through an ETF do not actually possess or own the assets; they are subject to both the counterparty risk of the ETF manager and that of the Custodial/Depository to which the ETF relies on (if the manager does not opt for an unlikely self-custody), as well as the risk of the intermediary/broker through which they acquire the instrument. In practice, the adage \"Not your keys, Not your coins\" reduces to a simple \"Not Your Coins, goodbye\" especially in the case of an hypothetical 6102 attack applied on ETFs. On a macro level, the same arguments made for custodial/exchange entities apply to passive funds on Bitcoin: the more they are utilized by institutional and retail investors as a form of \"investment in bitcoin,\" the more bitcoin is absorbed into their masses. Consequently, their coercive power over users and contractual (i.e., economic) power over other subsystems of the Bitcoin Network increase. If a specific Bitcoin ETF were to acquire a significant (if not dominant) market share of circulating bitcoin over time and systematically use its proceeds to subsidize developers of the Bitcoin Core client, it could influence their actions, guide client implementations, and thus the development direction of the entire network towards its desires. This would be a case where the centralization of one dimension (that of custodians through ETFs) leads to the centralization of a much more vital dimension: that of developers discussed earlier. Conclusions Upon examining various dimensions of decentralization within the Bitcoin network, two critical subsystems come to the forefront due to their significant relevance and current limited decentralization: the mining/hashrate subsystem and the coding/developers subsystem. While discussions around the former have been ongoing since the inception of the Bitcoin project, with debates on numerous 51% attacks and their solutions, the latter has largely been overlooked or underestimated by analysts. Despite the historically honest and transparent behavior of core developers, whose intentions have consistently aimed at the genuine success of the technology, this does not guarantee the same conduct in the future. The numerical scarcity of Bitcoin Core developers, coupled with the disproportionate code contributions from a select few individuals compared to the total participants, poses risks of infiltration, hacking, and social manipulation that cannot be downplayed. The insufficient number of developers to ensure an attack-proof level of decentralization might stem from their limited recognition and financial rewards within the Bitcoin user base and the wider global programming community. Whereas miners have a financial incentive predetermined by the protocol itself to participate constructively and faithfully in the network, the same cannot be said for client programmers who lack predetermined, impartial, or proportional remuneration for the quantity and quality of their work. Those among them who have not enriched themselves with Bitcoin in the network's early days and/or do not act out of selfless altruism, have to rely on grants, scholarships, and donations from third-party philanthropic entities to sustain themselves. The main subsidies to Bitcoin Core developers currently come from various organizations and companies in the Bitcoin Economy such as OpenSats, Spiral, Square Crypto, Chaincode, MIT DCI, Blockstream, Gemini, Coinbase, BitMEX, Hardcore Fund, etc. Their contribution is crucial, but their generosity is not necessarily neutral or disinterested. It\u2019s not a bad thing in itself, but what would happen if other less benevolent donors, who likely have intentions and interests not aligned with the success of Bitcoin, were to take their place? This raises concerns about potential interference from less benign donors, which could compromise the security and stability of the entire Bitcoin network. The limited numbers, ad hoc collaborations, and uncertain economic incentives make the role of core developers unattractive to most programmers, rendering them vulnerable to corruptive or manipulative actions. To address these challenges and incentivize the independence, participation, and retention of core developers, we outline a few ideas here. At one extreme, we could have dedicated micro-crowdfunding platforms that exclusively provide limited, non-refundable donations from donors to avoid imbalances and undue influences from a few individuals. At the other end, a multilateral agreement - optional but technically binding for signatories - among the big players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (miners, ETFs, exchanges, etc.) in which they commit, verifiably by all, to contribute a predefined share of their earnings to Bitcoin Core developers, thus subjecting themselves to a kind of voluntary self-taxation. In both cases, technical implementation of incentive systems could utilize DAOs, smart contracts, and layer-2 solutions to regulate criteria for disbursement and anonymize payment flows to developers. Naturally, the two ideas mentioned are not mutually exclusive or conclusive. Even less should they be imposed from above. We consider them simple grassroots ideas to initiate a serious debate on the need to value the key role of Bitcoin programmers without undermining their autonomy. A debate that, in our modest opinion, should be urgently reopened among all those who believe in the value of this revolutionary technology. This is a guest post by Michele Uberti.

Many people all over the world are currently living somewhere presenting serious risks to their livelihood and well being, everything from totalitarian and persecutory governments to the general state of the economy deteriorating so badly that their ability to sustain themselves is in question. This puts people in a horrific position, having to choose between continuing to tough out the situation and maintain their possessions, or leaving most of what they own behind to flee from abusive governments or a destroyed economy. If they are lucky enough to even have the financial and practical capability to leave in the first place. You can\u2019t bring large amounts of cash or gold with you, they\u2019ll be seized at the border. Bank account balances can be completely restricted, meaning that even though you can technically access it globally in most cases, it can be locked down in an instant. You can\u2019t bring your house, you can\u2019t bring your car unless you can drive where you\u2019re going (if you even own one), you can\u2019t bring any sizable physical asset. All you can take with you is what you can carry on your back or in a few bags. Bitcoin completely changes this dynamic. It is a vehicle that can transport any amount of wealth you have stored in it across any border. All that is required is you in one form or another carry twelve words with you across the border. That is all it takes to bring your wealth with you should you find yourself in a situation where things are bad enough you have no option but to flee. These are some of the best options. Border Wallets Border Wallets is a very interesting scheme taking advantage of how people\u2019s brains work with visual memory. The tools provide a way to generate a two dimensional grid of all the possible seed words. This can be generated in a few different ways, but I would recommend that anyone who uses this tool use the deterministic generation mechanism. This ensures that in a worst case scenario if you lose your copy of the seed word grid, you can regenerate the same one if necessary. This grid can then be filled in using a recognizable or memorable pattern. Human beings are very visual animals, and the reality of how our minds work is that visual patterns are much easier for the average person to memorize than words. After generating the grid, users can select words on the grid in a recognizable pattern that is easy to recognize. It is critically important to remember the order you are going to follow for actually turning this into a seed phrase. I.e. are you following all the highlighted words left to right in a row, then moving down each row? Are you going down each column top to bottom, then moving to the right one column? Recognizable shapes are great, a circle, a square, even a Bitcoin B. With the ability to regenerate the same grid, an easily recognizable pattern you can fill in, and the order in which to turn those highlighted words into a seed phrase, Border Wallets present a powerful tool designed specifically to ease the mental load of keeping a seed phrase memorized. This should allow you to cross an international border without anything identifiable at all that is related to Bitcoin. Just remember, before actually making the trip, test things. Run through the process of creating the word grid, make sure that you can properly regenerate the same grid. Create a test pattern and set it aside, then come back and make sure the pattern you remember arrives at the same word seed. Once you\u2019ve run through the testing and verified you can regenerate everything properly, you can make the trip out of the country with confidence that your Bitcoin is safe and will be accessible when you arrive at your destination. Samourai Wallet Samourai Wallet in addition to their coinjoin implementation Whirlpool, and other privacy features, has one particular feature that has existed from almost the beginning of the project in one form or another: Stealth Mode. This is an incredibly valuable feature in a situation where you must cross an international border. The mobile application can be set to obscure everything about the fact that it is a Bitcoin wallet. The logo is changed to masquerade as a number of different applications, and all signs of Samourai Wallet being installed are obscured. It can function as either a calculator app, a VPN app, a QR scanner, or a notepad. Each fake application is functional, and when launched has the appearance of being whatever decoy app the user selects. Each decoy app has a different mechanism hidden in it to actually open Samourai Wallet to access your Bitcoin. It is important to note that this will not stand up to any forensic analysis of your device. I.e. if it is seized and actually inspected using computer forensics software, they will be able to suss out the fact that a Bitcoin wallet is installed. However, a manual inspection of your device (which is much more common if any inspection takes place at all) should give no sign whatsoever to a customs agent that a Bitcoin wallet is installed on your device. Steganography Steganography is the technique of hiding a piece of data or information inside of some other piece of information. A good example of this is hiding information inside of a jpeg. It is possible using different digital tools to take a secret piece of information, such as a text document, or a bitcoin seed phrase, and embed it inside of a jpeg. The jpeg would look completely normal, with no changes to the visual image, but the file itself would have the secret information included within it to be extracted by anyone who knew it was there. Now this requires putting your seed phrase on a computer to encode and embed it, and requires using tools that are not very user friendly (there are web based tools for this kind of thing, but NEVER use something like that to handle your seed phrase or private keys). However, the general concept is something that can be useful. Do you have a book? Any book? If you do, see if you can go through it page by page and find the words in a seed phrase you have generated in the correct order through the pages of the book. If you can, you\u2019ve just found something that can be used to transport your seed phrase safely without anyone suspecting it. Simply go through the book and highlight (in order) the words making up your seed phrase as you find them. Done. You can simply stroll through border control with a completely innocuous looking book, knowing that hidden within it is your bitcoin savings. Memorization I mention this last specifically because all the other options presented above are much safer for most people, especially given that Border Wallets is a system set up specifically to aid peoples\u2019 ability to memorize their seed phrase in a safer way. In the event that for some reason that is not an option, just memorizing your seed phrase as it is can be a path to take. But I must stress that this is very risky for many people. If you go this route, be very careful. Test yourself numerous times, memorize your phrase and give yourself a week of not looking at it. Repeat it to yourself in your head every day. At the end of this period write down what you remember and compare it to the original copy. Do this a few times. When it comes time to leave, as soon as you possibly can after arriving at your destination write it down again and create a physical copy. This is by no means the best, or safest, option for transporting your Bitcoin keys across a border. But sometimes people find themselves in a situation with limited options. This should be a last resort. Final Thoughts The list above of tools for transporting your seed phrase across an international border are by no means exhaustive. There are numerous other options for ways to accomplish this, all with their own trade offs in terms of risk of loss or detection. I\u2019m sure that if many of you reading this put your minds to it you could come up with your own methods for doing so. The options here were chosen because of the reliability, simplicity, and the safety against loss. If you feel the need or desire to venture into more complicated or self created ways to transport your seed, I recommend extreme caution in doing so. The options above should be applicable and useful for the vast majority of situations people can find themselves in, and are some of the safest ways to do so. Keep these tools in mind, one day they might make the difference between starting over somewhere destitute, or starting over somewhere with your accumulated wealth intact.","article_summary":"Sometimes things get politically or economically so unstable that you have no option but to flee your home.

While the halving is usually a reminder of Bitcoin\u2019s reliability, this year\u2019s event was anything but predictable. On and off-chain, significant narratives converged and culminated in an unprecedented climax. I wasn\u2019t there for the first halving but the previous two events seemed inconsequential. Somehow, block 840,000 felt like it ushered in a new era. Culturally, Bitcoin appears to be closing in on escape velocity. Four years ago, you would\u2019ve been hard-pressed to find a Bitcoiner who did not rally under the maximalism flag. Hot off the heels of the blocksize war and a brutal bear market, orthodoxy reigned supreme. Today, the landscape is unrecognizable. Piety is openly mocked and most of the high priests have been exiled. Apostasy is trending. We\u2019ve broken out of the insular mold \u2014 everyone is a Bitcoiner. Money for enemies Of course, with the dominant cultural institution having fallen, the barbarians are at the door. The holy blockchain is being pillaged and no Bitcoin node is safe. At the risk of using yet another analogy, it\u2019s a true Berlin Wall moment. Speculative mercenaries have crossed over and they\u2019re finding the place pretty comfy. Ordinals, BRC20s, Runes. It\u2019s a degen world and we're all living in it. As expected, this defacing of Bitcoin\u2019s sanctity isn\u2019t sitting well with the old guard. They have been busy denouncing this behavior, adamant that heretics should be filtered ostracized. \u201cBitcoin must not be associated with scams.\u201d Thumping their bible, they have seemingly little regard for the permissionless ideals of the system. Sinners should repent or burn in hell. Their culture must prevail, lest Bitcoin has failed. Not since the Silk Road has a Bitcoin use case been so widely controversial. Blasphemous, I know, but hardly surprising. The free market has a way of exposing the hypocrisy of its most ardent proponents. I empathize with the idea that this rampant speculation is damaging for most of its participants. Fiat has thrown the average person\u2019s financial incentives so out of whack that gambling is now perceived as EV+. Memecoins are Gen Z\u2019s lottery tickets and Bitcoin memecoins are the new meta. If you\u2019ve dedicated your life to freedom money in the hope of distancing yourself and your loved ones from this exact behavior, it\u2019s pretty depressing to see it rear its ugly head on your turf. Indeed, those who seek to create value should hate nothing more than to see others throw it down the drain. On the other hand, Bitcoin makes no such moral or ethical judgment. Salvation isn\u2019t promised or expected from anyone who adopts it. It is both for the best of us, and the worst. The scaling fumble The halving also put a spotlight on Bitcoin\u2019s awkward technological state. Unless you were among the privileged few with existing Lightning liquidity, Bitcoin was practically unusable as a payment method over the weekend. You can imagine the dunk fest on Twitter when it was suggested LN nodes disable routing to avoid costly force closures. I won\u2019t pretend there is an easy way out of this predicament. Sure, we can bury our heads in the sand and pretend the current activity is unsustainable. We can circlejerk about UTXO and channel management. Another option is to meet users where they are. Drop the ideological arrogance and accept that certain tradeoffs are acceptable, if not necessary, to build a global and reliable payment system. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow but trust-based alternatives are both viable and, for all intents and purposes, probably superior to the gymnastics currently required by \u201ctrustless\u201d alternatives. This is why I choose to remain optimistic about the road ahead. The progress around ecash mints is awe-inspiring if you ask me. It allows us to leverage Lightning\u2019s strength while addressing the last-mile problem that has plagued it. It opens up a world of possibilities for builders to improve on existing custodial solutions and get them out of the silos they currently operate in. Meanwhile, we can continue working on more ambitious proposals and attempt to reduce or remove trust assumptions. Bitcoin\u2019s properties shouldn\u2019t be easily conceded for the sake of mass adoption. That said, the devil is in the details and complexity often comes at the expense of user experience. Not all payments are the same and most probably shouldn\u2019t be burdened with the cost of on-chain censorship resistance. At least from a technical perspective, this is no Bitcoin renaissance. It\u2019s more of a case of everything old is new again. From Satoshi Dice to Magic Eden. From Counterparty to Runes. From Digicash to Fedimints. We\u2019ve seen this story before except this time IS different. This time we have to foot the bill for our success and the hubris that came with it. We can\u2019t afford to be cute anymore.

It doesn\u2019t have a physical address, or a specific place you can track it down. It\u2019s everywhere. This is what gives Bitcoin its superpowers, what makes it a truly decentralized and globally accessible monetary network. Your bitcoin isn\u2019t stored in your wallet but at Bitcoin addresses recorded by every computer running a Bitcoin node all over the world. Your wallet simply stores the private keys that allow you to control bitcoin at those addresses. That means that your Bitcoin can be accessed from anywhere in the world. In this way, Bitcoin gives you superpowers as well. You can \u201ctake\u201d your Bitcoin with you wherever you go. All you need to do is bring your private keys with you, and it is accessible and spendable from any point on the planet where you can access the internet. This can wind up being one of the most valuable and important abilities in a world that is becoming increasingly politically and economically unstable. Every day hundreds of thousands of people for one reason or another are picking up everything they can carry and leaving their home country for somewhere else. Somewhere that is safer, somewhere with more economic security and opportunities, somewhere they will not be persecuted for political or religious reasons. The problem with doing this, is inevitably you have to cross a border. Generally, that means, except in the most extreme circumstances, dealing with customs agents employed by your government. Governments worldwide place extreme restrictions on financial assets, money, and other valuables you may cross the border with. They don\u2019t like when people try to remove monetary goods from their local economy without permission. Attempting to flee your country for your own safety or to attain better opportunities is greatly complicated by this reality. In many cases, it means having to leave behind savings, valuables or anything the government would not allow you to bring with you when leaving. Bitcoin is the answer to this problem. Why Bitcoin is So Effective at Crossing Borders Your Bitcoin is accessible from everywhere in the world, you just need to keep your private keys with you. And typically, wallets allow you to restore your private keys using a 12-24 word seed phrase. Carrying 12-24 words with you is infinitely easier than a bundle of cash, or large amounts of gold or jewelry. Traditional assets are bulky, physical, and identifiable. Bitcoin is Permissionless Bitcoin is permissionless, as the ability for network participants to join and leave the network at will is not mediated by a centralized party. The agency of individuals to participate is solely at their discretion. By virtue of existing outside of the traditional banking and financial system, Bitcoin\u2019s supranational qualities make it uniquely fit for entering and exiting national jurisdictions. Pseudonymity is a key component of Bitcon\u2019s permissionless nature. By possessing a private key to sign transactions, individuals can access and control their wealth regardless of their relationship with their country of residence. While there are caveats in that individuals incur risk in transgressing regulation, and must take responsibility to protect their privacy (for example, running a node can help protect your privacy when interacting with the Bitcoin network). Bitcoin is Decentralized Enabling Bitcoin\u2019s permissionlessness is its decentralization. With a globally distributed network of miners and validating nodes, the Bitcoin ledger has amassed resilience to control by centralized entities including companies and governments. The central enabling constraint of Bitcoin as a money \u2013 its 21 million supply cap \u2013 is also a key factor in its suitability for individuals to retain wealth between national jurisdictions. While the public-private key architecture of the network is of course beneficial, it would be much less impactful (and likely obsolete) if it were not for the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s sound monetary policy enables wealth to be stored for an indefinite period of time. By existing on computers around the world across political jurisdictions, and continually utilizing proof-of-work consensus to ensure the integrity of the ledger every 10 minutes, both access and fidelity of one\u2019s wealth can be retained over time. The Security of Cryptography Access to and security of private keys are another critical aspect when it comes to transcending national borders. Bitcoin private keys are typically 256-bit numbers, meaning that the probability of guessing a private key \u2013 known as a \u201cbrute force\u201d method \u2013 is statistically incredibly unlikely. So unlikely, in fact, that you are more likely to select a specific atom from all that currently exist in the universe than you are to randomly guess a bitcoin private key. It should be noted that this security relies on an unproven (and debatably unprovable) assumption that P!=NP, which is the basis for cryptographic security in general. Nuances aside, the cryptographic nature of Bitcoin private keys provides a nearly impenetrable bulwark against confiscation \u2013 another essential component that makes Bitcoin a useful tool for transcending international borders. Wrapping Up Traditional mechanisms for storing and transferring wealth \u2013 gold, fiat currency, commodities and even art \u2013 can achieve their stated outcomes, but fall short of providing an efficient, secure and reliable means of doing so. Bitcoin, as the first truly decentralized instance of digital cash, surpasses its competitors in providing permissionless access and financial freedom to its users. When it comes to crossing borders, and existing without the auspices of governmental authorities, the cryptographic, sound and immutable qualities of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s invention are a step-change in how individuals can express their agency and autonomy. While each of Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental qualities on their own are indeed useful, in combination, they offer an increasingly unstoppable means for self-sovereignty that puts individuals back in control of their wealth. Hopefully now, if you didn\u2019t already, you can understand the immense power that Bitcoin offers people in protecting and maintaining control of their money in even the worst of circumstances someone can find themselves in. It truly is a superpower.","article_summary":"Bitcoin exists outside the control of central authorities and in doing so, allows individuals to control and safeguard their wealth regardless of the political and social climate they find themselves in.

I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to submit a dissenting opinion about Ordinals. With technical editor Shinobi at the helm, writers\u2019 contributions are permissionless! On Technical Feats I appreciate Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo\u2019s posts detailing all of Bitcoin\u2019s history, but he is morally wrong on Ordinals, just as he was on the Ethereum Merge: Source: https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1570383464360251398?s=20 While the Merge was a great technical feat for Ethereum, the switch to Proof of Stake only made it even less decentralized. And with Casey\u2019s technical feat of Ordinals, he also hurts Bitcoin by making it less fungible. On Peter McCormack\u2019s What Bitcoin Did podcast, Pete Rizzo argued that \u201cin the worst case, people who own ordinals at least own some bitcoin.\u201d No. The worst case is that people realize they\u2019ve been scammed and never want to touch Bitcoin again. On Making Money Some try to defend that flipping Ordinals for profit is not a scam, but simply people willingly gambling on speculation. Likewise, many people bought bitcoin at the cycle top in 2021 without having done any research, and haven't touched Bitcoin since realizing losses. Speculators buy Ordinals for the same reason they buy bitcoin: to make money. However, on this issue, the position of Bitcoin Maxis is clear: Bitcoin is not an intangible asset that suffers from the same Greater Fool Theory as Ordinals. Two meaningful ways saving in Bitcoin contrasts with gambling on Ordinals are network effects and actual limited supply. Many copycat altcoins have been issued, but none have the network effects of the OG. Additionally, most altcoins get dropped out of the air via Proof-of-Stake, with little physical cost to greater issuance. Bitcoin is only issued via Proof-of-Work, putting real weight and staying power behind its value. Bitcoin Maxis who are here to fix the money, know that we don\u2019t buy Bitcoin to make money, but to fix the world. On Rare Collections On What Bitcoin Did, McCormack makes the case that no one is buying Ordinals to actually collect. Some Ordinals supporters have deluded themselves to the point that they think while most are trying to flip, some are actually collecting. Esteemed art auction house Sotheby\u2019s held an auction in January 2024 for ordinals, but putting their brand behind this \u201ccollection\u201d doesn\u2019t make it so. https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale I concede that whether or not I am morally opposed doesn\u2019t change the fact that there are people who find value in collecting worthless things. Some may argue that Sotheby\u2019s isn\u2019t scamming anyone if they are a willing buyer for digital art. However, it is a scam because they\u2019re not buying digital art since they don\u2019t actually own anything. I can add the same digital art to any transaction. It\u2019s only with their shared delusion that by using the ordinal protocol, same as their peers, the digital art they own in their transaction is more valued than the digital art in mine. What I will NOT concede is the notion that ordinals and NFTs are unarbitrary\u2014they are. I can take the jpeg of every Quantum Cat, and re-release the same 3000 cat collection, and tell people mine don\u2019t cost 0.1 bitcoin each, but only 0.0001 bitcoin each. Such cheaper. Much better deal!! There\u2019s nothing rare or special about it. Do people want to pay Udi or Sotheby\u2019s the 0.1 bitcoin to own the address to the Sat to the cat in their collection, or the same cat in mine? In fact, a copycat collection has already been created trying to do just that, called Quantum Rats. Source: https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1749981929955373546 Of course adding other collections isn\u2019t quite as direct as diluting supply of an existing one, but it\u2019s close enough. If a collection starts small and gets so expensive that the creators make a separate but similar collection with the purpose of making them available for more people, it\u2019s really just to scam more people. It\u2019s a moral judgment, but Ordinals don\u2019t uphold the values of a Bitcoin Maximalist. Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million, but there\u2019s no limit to the number of Ordinal collections that can be created. Next, Udi might release \u201cmutant\u201d quantum cats, or \u201cbored\u201d quantum cats, which become more popular and make the originals all worthless. That\u2019s the scam. That\u2019s the rug pull. The rug pull formula is simple: Start a \u201crare\u201d collection, hype it up with wash trading with yourself and influencers, then leave a sucker holding the bag. Then do it again, and again, and again. Bitcoin could succumb to \u201cgreater fool theory\u201d too, but the difference is the network effect that has made Bitcoin survive unlike any other pump and dump crypto. On Digital Art Ownership On the contrary, owning digital art does exist \u2014 intellectual property exists. I can pay for a cover art design, so I own the art for Bitcoin Girl: Save the World. I own the files and I make the merch. If anyone tries to sell physical merchandise with digital art I own, then it\u2019s copyright infringement. Source: https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Girl-Save-World-Dog/dp/B0BS8XB72K/ Source: https://www.realbitcoindogmerch.com/ Think about all the digital files or character art for every video game or Pixar animated movie. Digital art rights exist, they are real, and they can be used to make new movies or products. On Filtering and Censorship I\u2019m not trying to filter out ordinals or censor transactions, but I think supporting ordinals is wrong. For Bitcoin to succeed, it needs to be money for enemies. However, Bitcoin Maxis should still champion for people to do their own research. Scammers are always going to scam but I\u2019m not going to support it. I\u2019ll still allow it, though thankfully ordinals don\u2019t need my permission anyways. I\u2019m not trying to break Bitcoin by adding filtering or censorship, but I can still be opposed. Hodlonaut put my position on ordinals succinctly: Source: https://twitter.com/hodlonaut/status/1751677477762617595?s=46&t=AJLfWYMcFR4tAoyfIomXHw Thank you Bitcoin Magazine for letting me rant against ordinals!

The nonprofit organization 2B4CH aims to hold a national referendum to amend Switzerland's constitution to require the central bank to hold Bitcoin. BREAKING: üá®üá≠Bitcoiners to launch a petition for Swiss National Bank to buy #Bitcoin Gradually, then suddenly üôå pic.twitter.com/8AkF8YrP86 \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 22, 2024 According to 2B4CH founder and chairman Yves Benna√Øm, this move would help Switzerland maintain its political neutrality and sovereignty in an uncertain global environment. \"We are in the process of completing the organizational preparations for the committee and preparing the documents that must be submitted to the State Chancellery in order to start the process,\" Benna√Øm stated. To achieve a referendum under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, the advocates must collect 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens within 18 months. With Switzerland's population around 8.77 million, roughly 1.15% of the populace needs to sign the petition. This signature requirement posed challenges when 2B4CH attempted a similar referendum in 2021. Luzius Meisser, President of the Bitcoin trading platform Bitcoin Suisse, supports the new campaign. \"By including Bitcoin in its reserves, Switzerland would mark its independence from the European Central Bank. Such a step would strengthen our neutrality,\" Meisser said. Meisser believes adopting Bitcoin could make Switzerland billions; he previously advised the SNB to allocate over $1 billion monthly to BTC instead of German bonds. However, SNB Chair Thomas Jordan has thus far resisted, claiming Bitcoin does not meet the reserve criteria. The campaign has won support from Bitcoin advocates globally, including German politician Joana Cotar. \"Now comes the popular initiative that wants to oblige the National Bank to buy Bitcoin,\" she tweeted. If successful, the move could make Switzerland the first country in the West to hold Bitcoin reserves. This mirrors El Salvador's groundbreaking adoption of BTC as a legal tender in 2021. Proponents argue integrating Bitcoin would diversify the SNB's assets and signal Switzerland's commitment to financial innovation.","article_summary":"A group of Bitcoin advocates in Switzerland are urging the country's central bank to add Bitcoin to its reserves.

Mempool Ordinals, numbering schemes for satoshis, have sparked controversy but also created an emerging market since its launch. These satoshis can also be classified by rarity, with \u201cepic satoshis\u201d being among the rarest, because they only occur at each halving epoch, which is every 210,00 blocks or approximately every four years. This scarcity has made these satoshis more valuable amongst those participating in the Ordinals market. The rarity of Ordinals have been labeled with six different ranks, as described below. Ordinals rarity levels: + common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block + uncommon: The first sat of each block + rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period + epic: The first sat of each halving epoch + legendary: The first sat of each cycle + mythic: The first sat of the genesis block The value of an epic satoshi is significant enough to attract attention from miners, developers, investors, and collectors. Bitcoin block 840,000, coinciding with the halving, includes an epic satoshi, intensifying interest in the first block of the halving. Marketplaces for Ordinals, lists rare satoshis at higher prices than what 1 normal satoshi is normally worth at a given time. These market's include high class auction houses like Sotheby\u2019s, signaling mainstream interest and attention. As Ordinals and related markets continue to grow, questions arise about their impact on Bitcoin's ecosystem. The introduction of new protocols like Runes adds complexity, attracting miners and investors seeking opportunities in this evolving landscape, as the incentives tied to \u201crare satoshis\u201d and Ordinals could introduce new strategies amongst Bitcoin miners.","article_summary":"ViaBTC has not only mined Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving block, but it has also mined the fourth ever \u201cepic sat\u201d.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/viabtc-just-mined-the-4th-ever-bitcoin-epic-sat-during-the-halving","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-20T07:22:03Z","categories":["news","halving","sats","bitcoin","markets","satoshi"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/viabtc-just-mined-the-4th-ever-bitcoin-epic-sat-during-the-halving","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyNjg3OTY1/bitcoin-mining.png"},{"article_title":"Human Rights Foundation Announces Finney Freedom Prize On Fourth Bitcoin Halving","author":"Frank Corva","article_detailed_content":"Today, on the day of the fourth Bitcoin halving, the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) announced the Finney Freedom Prize, commemorating the work of Hal Finney, one of the earliest public champions of Bitcoin.

Everyone celebrates the halving each cycle as a moment where Bitcoin becomes a more scarce asset, an event where historically the price has skyrocketed in reaction to the change in the issuance schedule and everyone waits with bated breath for history to repeat itself. I\u2019m sure everyone is all too familiar with these dynamics, so today as we all sit around waiting for block 840,000 to hit, let's look at a few lesser known facts about Bitcoin\u2019s supply schedule and halvings: The total supply of Bitcoin is actually not present anywhere in the codebase. The code simply specifies a starting reward of 50 BTC per block and modifies that value each halving by cutting it in half. The total supply of Bitcoin is actually not 21 million coins. Because of how the code in Bitcoin actually works, simply cutting the supply in half every halving, there will only ever be 20999999.97690 BTC in circulation by the time the coinbase subsidy drops to 0 satoshis. The supply, due to a quirk in how the programming language (C++) that Bitcoin is written in, was not capped at all originally. In 2214 the entire supply would have started issuing again, resetting the block reward back to 50 BTC per block and going through the issuance of another 21 million coins again. The BIP is written up in a joking manner, but this was corrected by BIP 42 in 2014. The halving supply curve in combination with the total supply has an interesting property. During the first subsidy period of 50 BTC coinbase rewards, 50% of the supply entered circulation. In the next halving period of 25 BTC rewards, 25% of the supply entered circulation. Each halving the value of the coinbase reward is the percentage of the total supply that enters circulation. During the first halving when the block reward decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC, a group of miners altered their Bitcoin clients and attempted to continue mining on a chain where the block subsidy remained 50 BTC after the halving. A lot of less technical people, or newer people, in this space probably weren\u2019t aware of most of these little factoids. Interesting little tidbits about things tend to fade off into the historical memory and disappear. If we do wind up seeing a reorg this halving over the Epic sat in block 840,000, maybe in 15-20 years most people using Bitcoin then similarly won\u2019t remember or know such an event occurred back in 2024. If you are lucky enough to be around now to see these little moments in history, cherish the experience. They\u2019re once in a lifetime things you can look back on, and probably use to annoy people around you despite their lack of caring. Happy Halving everyone.","article_summary":"A short list of little known facts about Bitcoin's supply schedule and past halvings.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fun-facts-about-the-halving","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-19T22:37:35Z","categories":["halving","technical","opinion"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fun-facts-about-the-halving","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODUxMjY1NDIxMjg4NDkz/default_a_bitcoiner_hosting_a_quiz_show_0.jpg"},{"article_title":"The Halving Holiday","author":"George Mekhail","article_detailed_content":"This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Halving Issue\u201d. Click here to get your Annual Bitcoin Magazine Subscription. Setting aside certain days for celebration, commemoration or remembrance is a nearly universal practice among humans. While different cultures and religions have their own unique customs and traditions, the entire human race seems to share an underlying propensity to recognize certain occasions as distinct from otherwise ordinary days. Finally, something we can all agree on! While the word \u201choliday\u201d or Holy Day, literally means a day that is set apart, there are also examples of special occasions which extend beyond a 24 hour period such as Hanukkah, Ramadan or even the 12 days of Christmas. After only 13 years since its inception, the nascent Bitcoin community has also begun observing its own special occasions: Jan 3rd, October 31st and Bitcoin Pizza Day, to name a few. Then, about every 4 years, there\u2019s the big one. Click the image above to subscribe! Unlike Birthdays, Kwanza or Presidents\u2019 Day, I would argue there are aspects of Bitcoin\u2019s Halving which make it somewhat extraordinary compared to our standard understanding of holidays and their accompanying traditions. Perhaps in ways that even Bitcoin\u2019s most ardent fanatics have yet to fully appreciate. It\u2019s not that the halving is more important than Christmas or more memorable than a bar mitzvah. But the implications and distinct properties which take place every 240,000 blocks, are simply unlike any other \u201choliday\u201d that humans are accustomed to observing. We are approaching Bitcoin\u2019s 4th ever Halving at block height 840,000 which marks the beginning of a new epoch and a reduction of the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. But we don\u2019t know exactly what day or time it will take place. You can\u2019t exactly mark the occasion on your calendar because it is dependent on block time not clock time. It is a quadrennial occasion, occurring every 4 years, but it also has a clearly demarcated finale: there will only ever be 32 halvings. Overall, its predictability is somewhat of a paradox. We know for sure the block height, reward change and total number of halvings while having no idea the time it will occur, the impact on bitcoin\u2019s valuation or the critical metric of subsequent network hashrate. Inevitable arguments and assertions about whether or not \u201cthe halving is priced in\u201d are as futile as other classic bitcoin debates such as stainless steel vs cast iron, bitcoin vs Bitcoin or my personal favorite: sats vs bits. New Year's Eve might be the closest example we have in terms of sharing similar holiday type dynamics with the Halving. The anticipation of a brand new year or a brand new epoch. The tendency to pause and reflect on the previous year or the previous epoch. The mystery of what a fresh 12 months will bring or the mystery of what the next epoch has in store. But New Year\u2019s Eve happens every December 31st at midnight. Nothing is fundamentally different about the world on January 1st and as far as we can tell, humans will continue to repeat this routine indefinitely into the future. Again, making these distinctions isn\u2019t meant to suggest one is \u201cbetter than the other\u201d but more to highlight the ways in which The Halving is particularly unique as an emergent cultural phenomenon. We can acknowledge that the implications of The Halving currently only impact a small subset of the world\u2019s population. Those who hold, transact with or mine bitcoin are really the only ones even paying attention. But it's fun to consider how the commemoration of The Halving might evolve and expand as worldwide adoption of this pristine asset continues to accelerate. Uncertainty and anticipation of the occasion aside, the underlying celebratory aspect of each halving points to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most important properties which is its perfectly knowable and universally auditable scarcity. There can only ever be 32 total halvings because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. As the block reward is cut in half, the number of bitcoin mined each epoch, is also cut in half. This means that each halving can essentially be understood as a mini-celebration leading up to the eventual cessation of halvings altogether. The 32nd and final halving is of course when the final few sats will finally be mined, circa 2140. If bitcoin continues on its current trajectory and one day becomes the default currency for humans everywhere, it's not far off to imagine that the actual holiday which might be celebrated by future generations could become whatever fateful day it happens to be when block 6,720,000 is mined and the final sats enter into the total supply. I get fomo just thinking about it. Even if I live to be 100 years old, that means I will only be around to see bitcoin reach its 18th or 19th epoch. The block reward will be about 10,000 sats and only 20 full coins will be mined by the entire network for the duration of the epoch. Compared to today\u2019s numbers, these facts are simply mind boggling. Rather than lament missing out on the grand finale of bitcoin\u2019s 32nd and final halving, I want to attempt to properly commemorate the handful of halvings I will have the opportunity to experience, starting with the upcoming 4th halving, estimated to take place sometime in April of 2024. Since this is still a new tradition, we\u2019ve yet to establish any sense of cohesion around how to best ring in each epoch. Some high time preference miners might even argue that it's more a day of mourning than a cause for excitement. Because there is no central authority in Bitcoin, there will likely be numerous manifestations when it comes to how various pockets of the bitcoin community will mark the occasion. There\u2019s probably no \u201cwrong\u201d way or even a necessity or expectation for a uniform way to celebrate the halving. But there might be value in exploring some possible ways to make the milestone a little more memorable by borrowing insights from other holidays. If we consider the primary ways in which humans have historically marked special occasions we are able to draw some inspiration when it comes to considering ways to approach the upcoming halving and future halvings that will occur in our lifetimes. I would point to 3 elements in particular that I\u2019m interested in exploring further: Reflection Ritual Renewal Reflection: 4 years or 210,000 blocks feels like a long ass time in bitcoin years. This feeling is likely more pronounced in our present day because we are still in the early stages of bitcoin\u2019s existence. Either way, it seems like taking time to reflect on the previous epoch as each halving approaches, could serve us well. A lot has happened since block height 630,000 and taking a moment to pause and consider how far we\u2019ve come, might offer a healthy practice and foster deeper collaboration among those of us working to bring about a universal bitcoin standard. This past epoch we saw, among other highlights: El Salvador adopt bitcoin as legal tender, Microstrategy, Tesla and SpaceX add bitcoin to their corporate treasuries, professional athletes demand their multi-million dollar contracts be paid in bitcoin, USD price going as low as $3k and as high as $69,420 and even politicians adopting strategic talking points in an effort to court bitcoiners. We rallied around Hodlnaut and we collectively changed our profile pictures to include laser eyes. We\u2019ve seen bitcoin super bowl ads and the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs. We\u2019ve made significant progress in a short period of time and reflecting on these moments can allow us to strengthen our resolve to continue fighting alongside fellow bitcoiners, yes, even the ones who enjoy an occasional salad. Ritual: since we don\u2019t know the exact date or time the halving block will be mined, it can be difficult to plan and execute a party or celebration to commemorate the halving. But few subsets of the population are as creative as bitcoiners when it comes to solving problems and this logistical hurdle is nothing compared to the battles we\u2019ve fought and the bears we\u2019ve slain. If we really want to pull off a party that has a moving target for the invitation\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d line, we will find a way. Perhaps the key to creating meaningful rituals is to ensure that we\u2019re among fellow bitcoiners at the turn of the halving. By intentionally seeking out a shared celebration, which can be repeated for each halving, we might receive similar benefits found in other holiday traditions such as creating memorable moments, deepening friendships and building community. This seems especially important for younger or newer bitcoiners who are still wrapping their heads around what is even taking place at the halving. But even the OGs might find value and inspiration in experiencing the tangible growth and momentum from epoch to epoch simply by being surrounded by other bitcoiners as the momentous block is mined. Renewal: with each new halving comes new opportunity. It's impossible to predict what the next epoch will bring or what new milestones we\u2019ll achieve. All we can control is our own attitude, posture and commitment to this crazy idea we\u2019ve all bought into and continue to show up for. Bitcoiners have the audacity to believe that a better world is possible. Many of us are here because we\u2019ve rejected the lie that we must accept the prevailing norms of our corrupt monetary system. We envision an optimistic future which allows people to preserve the wealth that they\u2019ve rightfully earned and transact with their peers without requiring permission from tyrannical authorities. It can be easy for us to drift away from this vision, especially as the harsh reality of intense bear markets takes its toll or the latest drama spirals on bitcoin twitter. But with each epoch we have a chance to hit reset on our mindset and return to the original reason for why we\u2019re here to begin with, why we\u2019ve decided to accept the ridicule of friends and family and why we\u2019re more committed to seeing this through than we were when we first started. The practice of renewal offers a fresh sense of hope and reminds us that we are not fighting with each other, but with those who attempt to stand in the way of the sovereignty we are ultimately pursuing. By combining these 3 habits and finding ways to implement them into our approach to each halving, I believe we can rediscover common ground, limit petty infighting and accelerate progress towards our shared objective of defeating fiat currency and its toxic societal byproducts. The Halving is a unique occasion and a worthy holy day. We frankly don\u2019t have to do anything at all and we will still receive the hard coded benefits of predictable supply and knowable scarcity. But for bitcoiners to truly maximize the potential of each halving, the people behind the protocol must intentionally rise to the occasion of developing rich traditions to effectively commemorate these unique and scarce milestones.

This event, also known as the halving, occurs approximately every four years and has far-reaching implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As Bitcoin Magazine prepares for a halving livestream, powered by Kraken, to commemorate this event, it's crucial to understand what the halving is and why it's so important. What is the Bitcoin Halving? The Bitcoin halving refers to the process by which the reward for mining new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain is reduced by half. This reduction occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Not all bitcoin were released onto the market at the same time, but rather new coins are slowly mined by Bitcoin miners every day as a reward for mining new blocks in the blockchain. The halving is encoded into Bitcoin's protocol to control its inflation rate and ensure that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined, making it a deflationary asset. In the very beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s history, the first block reward was 50 BTC. After the first halving in 2012, the block reward was cut in half to 25 BTC per block, and then cut in half again in 2016 to 12.5 BTC per block, and once more in 2020 to 6.25 BTC per block. Now, the block reward is getting cut in half to 3.125 BTC per block, with the next halving expected in 2028, cutting the reward down to 1.5625 BTC per block. Bitcoin will continue to cut its new supply creation in half until there is no more bitcoin left to be mined, which is currently slated for the year of 2140 in May. Importance of the Halving The halving event is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it directly impacts the supply of new bitcoins entering circulation. With the block reward reduced, the rate of new bitcoin creation slows down, leading to a gradual decrease in the available supply. This scarcity is a fundamental factor driving Bitcoin's value proposition as a store of value. Secondly, the halving has historically been associated with bullish price movements. Previous halvings, such as those in 2012 and 2016, were followed by substantial increases in Bitcoin's price. This pattern is partly attributed to the reduced supply coupled with sustained demand, leading to a potential imbalance that favors price appreciation. TD Direct Investing Bitcoin has increased around 743% since the last halving in 2020, rising from ~$8,755 to an all time high of $73,790 on March 14, 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, market participants are expecting to see another increase in the price of BTC, as strong institutional demand for the asset is coming in from recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange traded products in the United States, Germany and Hong Kong, as well as the London Stock Exchange that is getting ready to offer physical Bitcoin exchange traded notes. Bitcoin Magazine and Kraken Halving Livestream To celebrate this momentous occasion, Bitcoin Magazine is hosting a halving livestream event tonight, powered by Kraken. This livestream, which will feature key players in the Bitcoin industry like Strike CEO Jack Mallers, as well as celebrities like Dave Portnoy, will delve into the top 21 moments of the last Bitcoin epoch, highlighting important milestones and developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The livestream isn't just about reflecting on the past; it's also about looking towards the future of Bitcoin.

Calculated probabilities were calculated by Greg @ learnmeabitcoin.com Block 840,000 is not just another block in the blockchain; it triggers the Bitcoin halving where the block reward is reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, cutting the amount of BTC mined each day in half. You don\u2019t have to be a Princeton economist to understand the impact this will have on the supply and demand dynamics for bitcoin. Beyond the obvious halving of the block reward, a new market has developed around Ordinals which could have a significant impact on what happens to the first block of the halving. Contained within the first block of the halving is an extremely rare \u201cepic sat\u201d. While Ordinals have divided some Bitcoiners on their merit, there is no arguing the impact they have had on Bitcoin.and it raises an important question, could Ordinals cause a blockchain reorg? Through this article we will dig into the basics of a reorg, Ordinals demand, how mining probabilities work, and finally who could pull off a successful reorg. Before we dig into this \u201cepic sat\u201d, let\u2019s build an understanding of what a reorg is. The Bitcoin blockchain is a slow and dumb database that creates blocks of data every 10 minutes or so. It continues working as intended, but occasionally, things get tense. When two miners find blocks nearly simultaneously, it creates a temporary fork in the blockchain. This moment of overlap leads to a brief period of uncertainty. These forks are resolved by the network through the longest chain rule, which is when the fork tip of the blockchain with more proof-of-work (the longest chain or aka more blocks) will be adopted as the valid chain. Orphaned blocks from the shorter chain are not included in the longer one, and the transactions they contain are returned to the mempool to be included in future blocks. This process of one chain becoming longer than the other and becoming the accepted version is known as a reorganization, or reorg. Click the image above to subscribe! Due to the incentive structures built into Bitcoin mining, reorgs are usually resolved as soon as the next block is found and added to the tip of one of the forked chains. This is because finding a block is extremely difficult, and miners are incentivized to work on the longest chain in order to build the next block, and get paid. If they are mining on the short fork, the rest of the network will leave them behind and they will have invalid blocks. The last thing you would want is to build a block that is rejected by the network because you\u2019ve built a block on a chain and are rejected by the network due to the longest chain rule. During the reorg period of a fork, miners build on whichever chain fork hits their node first and try to build a block to get the longest chain. Now don\u2019t get worried about reorgs. They happen every couple of months (on average) and typically involve one or two blocks. These short reorgs are part of the network\u2019s regular operation and quickly resolve without any significant impact on the network and its users. It\u2019s worth noting that deep reorgs that consist of many blocks are rare and, correspondingly, more disruptive. They can be triggered by a network split such as what happened in the Blocksize wars, or a new large miner coming to the network, or an attempt to double-spend transactions (this is very rare). Most Recent Reorgs Source: Learn Me A Bitcoin The Bitcoin protocol and its incentives are designed so that there\u2019s a low likelihood of deep reorgs occurring. Consensus rules and incentives are meant to keep the network stable and secure. For example, most exchanges and payment processors require that a transaction be confirmed by a set number of times\u2014usually six or more\u2014before a transaction can be considered final, thus greatly reducing the chances of it being unwound by a reorg. Small reorgs happen and are mundane and frequent operations within the Bitcoin blockchain, but large reorgs are notable and very irregular. About That Epic Sat You\u2019ve probably heard the buzz about Ordinals, that is \u201ca numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and transferring individual sats\u201d. Some argue that Ordinals are a scam and they have no place in Bitcoin, but here\u2019s the thing, an emerging market is rapidly growing around Ordinals. For now, they are here, and they are getting attention from miners, devs, VC, collectors, scammers, and haters alike. When it comes to Ordinals, they are classified by their \u201crarity\u201d and markets determine value. Ordinals rarity levels: + common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block + uncommon: The first sat of each block + rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period + epic: The first sat of each halving epoch + legendary: The first sat of each cycle + mythic: The first sat of the genesis block If we consider the scenario where all Bitcoin has been mined, which implies that all 21 million bitcoins (or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis) are in circulation, we can calculate the total quantity of each level of Ordinals: Uncommon: There would be a total of 6,929,999 uncommon satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each block. Rare: There would be a total of approximately 3,437 rare satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each difficulty adjustment period. Epic: There would be a total of 32 epic satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each halving epoch. Legendary: There would be approximately 5 legendary satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each cycle (noting a slight approximation due to division). Mythic: There is 1 mythic satoshi, which is the first sat of the genesis block. These figures give an overview of how the rarity classifications would distribute across the total supply of satoshis once all Bitcoin is mined, showcasing the unique and scarce nature of certain satoshis within the Bitcoin network. The Ordinals Market and Beyond Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve seen rapid development in Ordinals technology and markets. Ordinals markets first emerged in Discord back channels where OTC deals were being made, but as demand has grown, digital marketplaces have developed for buying and selling Ordinals. US Based Magisat.io lists various types of Ordinals and has Rare sats listed for a staggering 3.49 BTC. This valuation has led to the creation of additional inventory of Ordinals beyond the category that was first described in the Ordinals documentation. Current Market on Magisat.io for standard Ordinals Stats as of 2-15-2024 This data shows that there is a small but growing demand for Ordinals. You can see the volume for Rare amd Uncommon Ordinals are greater than 26 BTC at the time of writing this. Keep in mind that this is only one marketplace and there are a growing number of OTC deals that are happening between buyers and sellers not to mention demand and business happening in other parts of the world. Looking beyond Ordinals marketplaces we are now seeing Ordinals make their way to legendary auction house Sotheby\u2019s further propelling the phenomenon towards the mainstream. If you look across the Pacific Ocean there is also significant demand for Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which would not be possible without Ordinals. So the demand for Ordinals is real and it is growing, not waning. The last significant item of note that could impact demand for this first block of the halving is the activation of Runes. Runes is another protocol released by the same creator of Ordinals, but the aim of Runes is to make a more efficient token protocol. The kicker on this is that with it going live in the first block of the halving, this alone will cause a significant demand to issue these new tokens as quickly as possible, presumably the first Runes issued will be more valuable than later issued Runes. \u201cYes there will be reorg incentive for block 840,000, but it's not for epic sat -- it's for the 20btc in fees from Casey's Runes.\u201d said Charlie Spears on X. This fee revenue call is speculation but it comes from observation from previous Ordinals and BRC20 activity. Sifting For Sats In Bitcoin, \"dust\" refers to an amount of bitcoin so small that it cannot be spent because the cost of a transaction fee would be higher than the amount itself. The concept of a \"dust limit\" therefore varies depending on the transaction fee and the type of transaction being made. However, there are general guidelines for what is considered dust, based on the type of Bitcoin script or address being used. The dust limit is calculated based on the size of the inputs and outputs that make up a transaction. For a transaction to be relayed by most nodes and mined, its outputs must be above the dust limit. The dust limit for a standard P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) transaction output is commonly considered to be 546 satoshis when using the default minimum relay fee of 1 satoshi per byte, but this can vary depending on the network conditions and the policies of individual nodes. For different script types, the dust limit calculation takes into account the size of the script and therefore can vary: P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash): This is the most common type, and its dust limit is usually around 546 satoshis. P2SH (Pay-to-Script Hash): Outputs for P2SH transactions can have a slightly higher dust limit because the script itself is more complex, requiring more data to be included in a transaction. P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key Hash) and P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script Hash): These SegWit (Segregated Witness) transactions have different weight calculations, leading to lower fees for the same amount of data. Consequently, the dust limit for SegWit transactions can be lower than for traditional P2PKH transactions. For P2WPKH, the dust limit might be closer to 294 satoshis. MultiSig: Transactions involving multiple signatures (MultiSig) have higher dust limits due to the increased data size required to accommodate multiple signatures. The exact dust limit can vary because it depends on the transaction's size and the current fee market. Additionally, changes in Bitcoin's protocol or node policies can affect these thresholds. It's also worth noting that some wallets and services might set their own dust limits based on their operational requirements. Pools Sifting Based on the information above we can examine blocks found by pools to see if pools are actively sifting blocks. What we see is 44% of the network is or has sifted for sats in the past year. We have reason to believe that additional pools are in discussions with sifting technology developers in deploying the tech on their pools, but nothing has been made public at this time. Our findings reveal that a very significant percentage of the mining network sees value in sifting for these sats, otherwise this would be a hobbyist endeavor. When this many big players are participating, you know there is some market dynamics happening. Source: Mempool.space as of 2-12-2024, ranking as of past 6 months Beyond blockchain investigation outlined above, miners are developing new markets of their own in mining irregular transactions for various projects. Most notably is publicluy traded mining pool Marathon who launched a new service called Slipstream which will mine complex transactions such as 1 sat UTXO which is far below the SEGWIT dust threshold of 546 sats. I bring this up because as they are offering this service, you can\u2019t help but assume that Marathon sees or will soon see value in Ordinals of they are willing to invest resources in serving Ordinal or Ordinal adjacent projects with this service. Afterall, the obligation of publicly traded companies is to maximize value for shareholders. We know more than 40% of hashrate is sifting for sats, but what does that really mean in the grand scheme of things. Afterall, we are talking about one specific sat, the epic sat in block 840,000. We know that Ordinals have value according to the very small market, we also know that this sat will likely be sold for more than a single blocks reward, but the big question is who could forcibly win this block? Proof of Work is all about the longest chain and ethics don\u2019t matter when it comes to Bitcoin and the blockchain. The chain is truth, even if you were to reorg. If you are hashing and following consensus and you build a longer chain then you are the victor. Based on the table from the previous section, we can see who the top pools are from the past six months. With that information we can model the probability of these pools forking and causing a reorg of the blockchain in order to win the epic sat but we need to run the numbers. For this we will explore the mining section of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Mining Explained in the Whitepaper Bitcoin mining is a race to find a valid block by solving a cryptographic puzzle, known as proof of work. The difficulty of this puzzle is adjusted by the network so that, on average, a new block is found every 10 minutes, regardless of the total computing power of the network. Now the security of this is where things get interesting. Section 11 of the Bitcoin whitepaper discusses the mathematics behind the security of the blockchain against attackers who try to alter the transaction history. The paper uses a comparison to a gambler's \"ruin problem\" to explain how difficult it is for an attacker to catch up with the rest of the network once they fall behind in the race to add new blocks to the chain. Essentially, if honest nodes control more computational power, the probability that an attacker can catch up decreases rapidly as they fall further behind in the blockchain. The probability that an attacker can catch up becomes almost zero if they do not have a majority of the computational power. The section outlines the process where transactions become more secure as new blocks are added to the blockchain, using a Poisson distribution to model the likelihood of an attacker catching up from being behind the chain tip. This framework provides the basis for understanding how blockchain achieves security through probabilistic means not absolute guarantees. In the Bitcoin whitepaper, the Poisson distribution is used to model the security of mining. It's used to quantify the probability that an attacker can catch up with the honest nodes after being z blocks behind, which is vital when considering the risk of a blockchain reorganization. It offers a statistical view of how likely it is for an attacker, with a certain percentage of the total network hash rate, to rewrite the blockchain history. Converting to C code... #include double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z) { double p = 1.0 - q; double lambda = z * (q / p); double sum = 1.0; int i, k; for (k = 0; k <= z; k++) { double poisson = exp(-lambda); for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) poisson *= lambda / i; sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k)); } return sum; } Who Could Pull This Off? Ordinals introduces a new incentive to reorg. Before Ordinals, the threat of a reorg was focused around a double spend attack, but Ordinals introduced the demand for individual sats, in this case the demand to win a specific block. The question is this, does the value of a single Epic sat or block warrant abandoning the longest chain in hopes of finding a couple quick blocks and winning that epic sat? Pubco mining pools will have a hard time justifying such action to shareholders, it seems negligent. But for private mining pools, they have different incentives and have a bit more freedom in how they pursue revenue. Looking at the top 10 mining pools by their percent of the network, we can model out who could pull off a reorg. One thing of note, the formulas described in the whitepaper only model catching up with the chain tip, however a reorg would require catching up to the tip +1 block, so our values below show that probability. The first thing I noticed was Foundry and Antpool have a higher % probability of pulling off a reorg from 1 block behind than their own % hashrate of the network. How could this be possible? This is because A miner with 30% of the hashrate being 1 block behind and attempting a reorg is at a disadvantage because the rest of the network (70% hashrate) collectively has a higher probability of extending the current longest chain before the miner can catch up and surpass it. However, due to the randomness captured by the Poisson distribution, there's always a non-zero probability that this miner could, through a streak of good luck, mine enough blocks in a row to take over the longest chain, even from one block behind. This is statistically unlikely but becomes possible with higher hashrate percentages and short reorg depths. The next key takeaway is how successful reorgs become less likely for each block they are behind. It is remarkable how Foundry could still reorg from 5 blocks behind. Conclusion The Bitcoin space is weird (always has been) and bitcoin miners are the longest of long when it comes to outlook on Bitcoin. Based on the reorg probability and the potential value from the additional value on the first block of the halving, the probability of a reorg feels likely. If you take the BTC mined from this block, the epic sat, plus the projected amount of fees that will be earned from the release of Runes, bigger pools would be foolish to not try and make a move to win this block. The only real downside of a reorg would be by working on the old chain and NOT winning the reorg, so you would miss out on possibly winning 1-2 blocks by mining on the original longest chain. I do hope for fireworks. It will be legendary to hear the talk tracks from the new Wall Street financial bros trying to explain this. At the end of the day, miners will have to make a decision, that is to simply build on the longest chain or to try and build the longest chain with heavy amounts of luck. They must consider the tradeoffs and pick their poisson.

There are many different ways to custody bitcoin, and there isn\u2019t one perfect method that suits everyone in all situations. The amount of bitcoin, the frequency it needs to be accessed, and other factors can determine which approach makes the most sense. The resources and security requirements of individual bitcoin holders will differ from those of institutions. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at how the custody strategies for these two groups compare, and then uncover an important truth about the application of multisig. Custody for individuals For typical individuals looking to hold bitcoin in self-custody, there are a number of tools to choose from. Depending on the situation, a simple singlesig wallet could be sufficient, with the option to add modifications such as seed phrase copying or BIP 39 passphrases. We created an article going into detail on various configurations, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Individuals less concerned with making frequent withdrawals, and looking to secure larger amounts for long-term savings, should consider a multisig wallet. Multisig offers threshold security, which can protect users from single points of failure, ensuring that no funds are lost if any one component of the setup is destroyed, misplaced, or stolen. Achieving threshold security is crucial for anyone who wishes to protect a substantial amount of funds.

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. There are a couple of other methods of threshold security besides multisig, but they are less appropriate for the average person. Shamir\u2019s secret share (SSS) is one method that still leads to temporary single points of failure during the initial setup, and during a withdrawal procedure. Multiparty computation (MPC) is another method which is extremely complicated to safely use. You can learn more about these in our article about threshold security models. Multisig can be combined with SSS or MPC to create multi-level thresholds. Multi-level thresholds refers to a threshold on the blockchain level (multisig) as well as a threshold on the key level (SSS or MPC). By combining these concepts, a fundamental threshold of keys serves as the primary security for bitcoin holdings, and each key can have protection from becoming compromised by using a threshold of its own. Despite a more complicated structure, two levels of thresholds offers clear advantages for keeping bitcoin maximally secure. For a sole individual trying to protect their bitcoin, this approach is widely considered unnecessarily complex. However, if the individual enters a collaborative custody partnership with one or more institutional key agents capable of deploying SSS or MPC, this increased layer of security becomes more easily accessible. Lone individuals holding bitcoin have several reasonable options, including single-level threshold security. Multi-level thresholds are unnecessarily complex unless a collaborative partnership is involved. Custody for institutions For companies, governments and other institutions who want to secure a bitcoin treasury, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to employ some of the custody strategies used by typical individuals. If multiple people are responsible for large sums of money, more rigorous controls are necessary. Institutional-grade bitcoin custody requires threshold security as a bare minimum. Multisig, SSS, and MPC are the available choices to meet that requirement. While MPC is by far the most complicated to safely use, and wouldn\u2019t be recommended for individuals, an institution with a team of experts might consider it. However, the extra effort to set up MPC doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a superior option to basic multisig. All three models have trade offs, as discussed in our earlier article comparing them. If an institution wants the highest level of security possible, they should consider using multi-level thresholds. In this arrangement, the foundation is multisig, which allows for a threshold of multiple separate private keys in order to access funds. Several different enterprise key agents can be responsible for each key, minimizing counterparty risk from any single custodian. Additionally, each key agent can apply their own threshold security for the key they are responsible for, by using SSS or MPC. This protects the key from any single officer within the key agent firm. Institutions would be unwise to use a custody model lacking threshold security for their bitcoin treasury. There are several threshold options to choose from, and for the utmost security, they can be combined to form multi-level thresholds. Multisig has a higher security ceiling As you may have noticed from the charts above, there is a distinct difference between the upper security limits of singlesig and multisig. With singlesig, there is only a single key which can have a threshold applied to it, creating a single-level threshold. Multisig can act as a single-level threshold as well, but also travel a step further: it can be the foundation of multi-level thresholds. Therefore, sizable bitcoin holdings that utilize a singlesig foundation rather than a multisig foundation\u2014which can often be observed by examining the address type\u2014have an opportunity for a security upgrade. Multi-level thresholds can unlock a robust multi-institution custody structure that distributes risk across key agents. Unchained private wealth and enterprise clients have several high-end key agents to choose from in order to set up this structure. Learn more and book a consultation!

Then, 25. Eventually, 12.5. After that, 6.25. And now, 3.125. Four halvings later, we enter the fifth of 33 epochs of Bitcoin. The first 32 epochs, in Bitcoin-terms, last 210,000 blocks, with the 33rd lasting until the heat death of the universe. At 10 minutes per block, on average, that means just about every four years, Bitcoin cuts its supply issuance in half. The specific numerical finite-ness that comes downstream of this mechanism \u2013\u2013 that defines bitcoin\u2019s scarcity in a nearly infinite universe \u2013\u2013 is ultimately irrelevant. Satoshi could have started at a 100 bitcoin block reward and we would have arrived at just about the same place today. But there are some statistical conveniences of starting at 50, such as that 50% of all bitcoin to ever be issued are during the first epoch. And thus, 25% of all bitcoin to ever be issued were issued in the second, and so on, and so forth. Speaking of fourth, the fourth epoch terminates in the fourth month of 2024 at the completion of the fourth halving at block 840,000. A lot happened the fourth time around: El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender, Wall Street\u2019s ETF play, the Taproot-enabling softfork, and even Ordinals. Every new halving brings up the legitimacy of cycle theory, of whether or not supply issuance can be \u201cpriced in\u201d. Each halving is a time of self-reflection for bitcoiners and the culture they curate. Not only is Bitcoin arguably no longer a counter-culture with nation-state and Wall-street adoption (co-option?), but it is no longer a mono-culture. While many things were born during this epoch, it is perhaps the death of the homogenous bitcoiner that is the most apparent.

Spending countless hours in solitude, meticulously writing the code that would bring the world its first-ever successful attempt at creating a truly decentralized monetary network, the first of which our species has ever had the privilege of experiencing. The pseudonymous creator\u2019s thought process is one we can\u2019t picture - laying out Bitcoin\u2019s framework and ironing out the innovation that is the network\u2019s distributed ledger, the complex mining process that secures it. And then, one of the most fundamental, yet underappreciated, pieces of Satoshi's design was the pre-coded, fixed supply schedule with a 50% reduction in new issuance that happens quadrennially - the Bitcoin halving. Hard-coded into Bitcoin\u2019s core, this deflationary event called \u201cthe halving\u201d, which enforces the reduction in the supply of the bitcoins being introduced into circulation, is undoubtedly a crucial technical element of the protocol and was a foundational design choice. The creation of a digital currency that would maintain its scarcity and by extension its value, over the long term. A digital currency that would exist beyond the reach of central banking policies and the whims of the hands that control them. That was Satoshi\u2019s idea. And to properly execute this, it had to have a pre-programmed finite supply of 21 million units, with an engineered supply compression mechanism that gradually slows down the rate of issuance of new coins in a four-year cycle. I\u2019m not going to get into too much detail about the Bitcoin halving and its technical aspects, because a lot of brilliant minds have already talked extensively about it, so why reinvent the wheel? Rather, let\u2019s take a few steps back in time. 15 YEARS AGO Let's go back a decade and a half, back to those grueling hours Satoshi Nakamoto must have spent working on Bitcoin. Hunched over, working tirelessly on the code, integrating the halving and all it was meant to represent for the network as a mechanism that ensures the long-term scarcity of this new digital currency. Theoretically, he must have known the profound impact the halving would have on the fiat value of Bitcoin. I mean, considering basic economics and how scarcity inversely correlates with value, it couldn\u2019t have been hard to derive that conclusion. However, is it possible that he could have anticipated the significant cultural influence this pre-programmed technical process would take on? In those early days, the Bitcoin community was a tiny one, comprising merely thousands globally - a few cypherpunks here and there, coders, and a handful of libertarian idealists tinkering in home offices, basements, and dorm rooms, securing the network while earning those block rewards. Unaware, of course, of the frenzy and excitement that would one day surround each approaching halving. And yet, that obscure, humble beginning, was about to birth a cultural phenomenon unlike anything those first few miners nor even Satoshi could have envisioned. With the gradual emergence of Bitcoin into mainstream consciousness over its 15 years of existence, the 4-year hard-coded algorithmic ritual morphed from mere technicalities of a program, into a global celebration - an event that unifies Bitcoiners worldwide, no matter their creed, race, and political ideology and all other superficial ethnocultural and socio-economic classifications we have created - eagerly anticipating, planning parties, that have now come to mark the progression of this monetary revolution. FROM MACRO EVENT TO QUASI-HOLIDAY The once arcane, behind-the-scenes process of miners receiving fewer freshly minted bitcoin, blossomed into a veritable quasi-holiday for Bitcoiners and Cryptography enthusiasts. With its gradual emergence from the fringes, from the darker corners of the internet back in the days when it used to be seen as a tool for hackers, unscrupulous individuals, and bad actors, Bitcoin gained mainstream awareness, enabling the halving to take up a seemingly mystical significance. It became not just a routine supply shock in BTC issuance, but a chance for Bitcoiners around the world to unite in their shared commitment to a monetary protocol that at its foundation, possesses the core principles of decentralization, limited supply, and independence from government manipulation. As we approach the 2024 halving - depending on when you\u2019ll be reading this - it has become curiously impossible to ignore the growing cultural significance of this event. Halving countdowns have now become a recurrent element on social media. Bitcoin and Crypto news platforms, as well as mainstream media outlets and other financial news platforms, have published reports about the halving over the past few months. And then there are events and parties scheduled throughout April 2024. At these events, Bitcoiners will gather for halving-themed parties and events across the globe - from a \"Bit-Rave\" festival in San Salvador to themed happy hours in the pubs of Bedford, UK, and even a lakeside gathering in the California desert. There\u2019s even talks of a bitcoin halving festival being held in Calabar, Nigeria. It's a fair bet that there must be a bunch of other such events either already past, or scheduled to hold within the month somewhere in the world. Though admittedly not all of them are exactly \u201chalving parties\u201d, but, the fact that they are all scheduled for April when we expect the confirmation of the 840,000th block, tells all. CEMENTING SATOSHI\u2019S VISION FOR SCARCITY AND DECENTRALIZATION As we look ahead towards the 2024 halving considering what it has grown to be these past decade-plus, one question comes to mind; will this quadrennial event continue to hold such profound significance? Bitcoin\u2019s identity seems to have formed its base around the halving. It seems to have been ingrained in such a way that Bitcoin, as we know it today, will not be what it is without the event. That much is clear. It creates a reliable, as well as a predictable cadence for Bitcoiners to gather in a shared celebration of the protocol's core ethos. Each iteration reinforces the network's commitment to true digital scarcity, decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance - the very principles that drew early adopters to this monetary revolution in the first place. The very same principles on which Satoshi\u2019s vision - not the flawed BSV fork though - is based. The halving can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy - each supply squeeze is expected to drive up bitcoin\u2019s price, thereby further cementing its place as a store-of-value asset that transcends time. This \u201cprophecy\u201d has enabled analysts, traders, and institutions to develop entire frameworks around the halving\u2019s anticipated impact. Which further emphasizes the point earlier alluded to; that it is ingrained in Bitcoin\u2019s identity. This weaves it into the cultural fabric of the digital currency in a way that transcends its origins as merely a technicality. CONCLUSION As the 2024 Bitcoin halving approaches, its ever enduring significance may lie in its ability to consistently remind Bitcoiners of the network's unwavering principles. In an era marked by rapid technological shifts and widespread social upheaval, the halving's reliability and unchanging nature provides a sense of stability - a guidepost - so to speak - for this movement. The halving serves as a totem, a rallying cry that unites Bitcoiners in their commitment to this monetary revolution, regardless of the fluctuations and disruptions that are unavoidable in the world we live in today. It will remain a quadrennial occurrence that will continue to hold an honored place in Bitcoin culture, reminding us of each passing cycle of the network's unshakable principles and the unstoppable force of Satoshi's infallible creation. This event, this beacon of hope in unsettling times, represents an enduring constant, a touchstone that reinforces the immutable foundations upon which the Bitcoin network is built. As the celebrations surrounding the 2024 halving reach a fever pitch once more, we can be certain that this tradition will remain a vital part of the Bitcoin movement, serving as a guidepost for adherents weathering the storms of a rapidly changing technological, social landscape, geopolitical uncertainties, and global economic maelstrom.

As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same. With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on April 19, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn\u2019t appear to be breaking a sweat. Why\u2019s that? One of the reasons is that Marathon plans to generate alternative streams of revenue utilizing the heat emitted from its bitcoin mining rigs. \u201cBitcoin mining in and of itself does something very efficiently, which is produce heat,\u201d Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201c50% of industrial energy spend is spent to heat things, so imagine if you could capture the heat from Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin miners could get paid for that. That would subsidize their cost of electricity.\u201d During a fireside chat with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, held on April 9, 2024 in Washington, DC, Thiel shared an example of how Marathon plans to utilize the heat its miners produce. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re doing in Nebraska actually is we\u2019re starting to heat greenhouses and do shrimp farming using the heat from Bitcoin mining as a byproduct,\u201d Thiel explained to Senator Lummis. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to start seeing this as a way for people to grow proteins in areas of the disadvantaged world,\u201d he added. Utilizing the heat Marathon\u2019s miners produce is one of the ways in which Thiel is looking to change the perception of Bitcoin mining from something that\u2019s parasitic to something that\u2019s productive. This dovetails well with the fact that Marathon continues to improve its ability to use waste gas as fuel for its miners. Toward the end of 2023, Marathon launched a pilot project in which it mined bitcoin with energy derived solely with landfill methane, a gas that\u2019s 80x more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. The project was a success, according to Thiel. \u201cIt was a proof of concept that showed that you could successfully mine bitcoin using landfill methane gas,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cMining on landfills is very hard, but we were able to prove that you could do it quite successfully.\u201d Thiel expanded on these efforts in his conversation with Senator Lummis, tying together the ideas that Marathon could produce this heat it plans to use while having a positive impact on the environment. \u201cYou generate energy with that by turning it into methane and then converting that into electricity and you create heat with the electricity,\u201d he told Senator Lummis. \u201cIf you can take a waste product, turn it into energy and feed heat back into an industrial process, you do more for the environment than a lot of environmentalists want. And at the same time, your cost to mine bitcoin becomes very small because your energy cost is low.\u201d","article_summary":"In a sit down with Bitcoin Magazine just days before the Halving, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings Fred Thiel articulates his plan to capitalize on the main byproduct of mining bitcoin: heat.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-18T20:17:14Z","categories":["bitcoin mining","business","news","marathon digital holdings","bitcoin miner"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"},{"article_title":"BlackRock Releases Bitcoin Education Series","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a series of educational content aimed at explaining Bitcoin, the Bitcoin halving, and its implications, along with insights into its approved spot Bitcoin ETF. \"April is packed with rare events this year, with eyes set on the upcoming bitcoin halving - a unique process that only happens every 4 years,\" said U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, Jay Jacobs. \"Tune in below to learn how this impacts bitcoin's value, and for more about investing in bitcoin ETFs.\" JUST IN: BlackRock releases educational #Bitcoin video. pic.twitter.com/CLaMtQtzDS \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 In a series of four videos, available on BlackRock's official website, the asset manager discusses the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as an investment, addressing common questions and concerns for investors looking to understand and navigate the Bitcoin landscape.

I will not refer to it as a whitepaper, those are real academic documents for adults. In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we\u2019ll have to break down the two pieces involved. The Building Blocks Rijndael\u2019s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate \u201cstaging\u201d transaction to withdraw their funds from the vault. This kicks off a timelock, during which they can at any time send their funds back to the vault or a secure cold storage wallet, and after the timelock the user can freely withdraw the funds to the destination they chose when beginning the withdrawal process. These are the only two ways bitcoin sent to the vault script can be spent. Explaining the full mechanics of how this is accomplished is essentially an article in itself, so I\u2019m going to do something I usually don\u2019t and hand waive this away as \u201cmagic.\u201d (Explained here by Andrew Poelstra) What this \u201cmagic\u201d allows you to do, by creating non-standard Schnorr signatures and with the help of OP_CAT, is to build the transaction the signature check is against on the script stack. This lets you enforce that certain parts of the transaction are exactly as defined ahead of time. It also allows you to put the output from a previous transaction on the stack in the process of building the transaction spending it, meaning you can compare outputs from the spending transaction against outputs from the previous transaction. This allows you to guarantee by comparing them that certain parts of the previous transaction\u2019s outputs match certain parts of the new outputs. I.e. the script, or an amount. So you can \u201ccarry forward\u201d parts of the old outputs into the new ones, and enforce that. Something else you can do with OP_CAT, which did not need Rijndael tinkering and experimenting with to prove, is verify merkle tree branches. Because you can CAT stack items together, and Bitcoin already supports hashing data on the stack, you can slowly build up a merkle tree root from a leaf node with the interior nodes. Hash two pieces together to get one hash, hash that with the pair hash, and so on. Eventually you get the root hash on the stack. You can then compare it with OP_EQUAL against a predefined root hash in the locking script. Unilateral Withdrawal These two building blocks are enough to facilitate a unilateral withdrawal mechanism from a group shared UTXO. A merkle root can be embedded in a transaction using OP_RETURN or another mechanism that commits to a leaf node for each user. The UTXO script can be structured so that any user with a balance can attempt to withdraw it. To do so they would provide the merkle branch committing to the amount they are entitled to, the authorization proof such as a public key to check a signature against, and construct the transaction on the stack to verify the appropriate conditions are met. Similar to Rijndael\u2019s OP_CAT vault, this withdrawal transaction would function as a staging point. User funds would be restricted by a timelock, and they would not be capable of completing the withdrawal until it expires. At any time before the timelock expires, any other user can create a fraud proof to stop the withdrawal and shove funds back into the group UTXO script. They can do this because of OP_CAT\u2019s ability to verify merkle trees. If someone has used a specific merkle branch to withdraw funds from the UTXO before, then that was included in a block somewhere. By constructing a transaction containing the SPV proof of that transaction inside an actual block, which can use OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL to verify the blockheader meets some minimum difficulty, they can prove on the stack that the merkle branch was used before. This allows duplicate withdrawals to be prevented. In addition to this, because you can use the \u201cCAT on the stack\u201d trick to ensure specific pieces of a previous transaction must be included in the next, you can guarantee that the current merkle root is carried forward into the next transaction after a successful withdrawal. You can also guarantee that change from the withdrawal goes back into the group sharing script. This guarantees that after one user withdraws their funds, the change UTXO is locked with a script that allows any remaining user to withdraw, and so on. Any user can unilaterally withdraw their funds at any time in any order, with the guarantee that the remainder of funds are still accessible to the rest of the users. The VM Part Readers should be familiar with the basic idea of BitVM. You can take an arbitrary computation and break it up into each of its constituent pieces and embed them in a large taproot tree, turning that computation into a back and forth challenge/response game. This allows you to lock bitcoin with more complicated conditions than is directly supported by bitcoin script itself. The only real shortcoming is the need to craft a massive amount of pre-signed transactions to facilitate this. The requirement to use pre-signed transactions is so that in the challenge/response dynamic, you can guarantee that coins are spent back into the large taproot tree encoding it unless an exit condition one way or the other is reached. OP_CAT and the ability to \u201ccarry forward\u201d data from previous transactions allows you to guarantee that without needing pre-signed transactions. So not only does this scheme allow any user to unilaterally exit on their own, it also allows locking conditions supported by a second layer that are not supported by Bitcoin script to actually be enforced in the withdrawal process. I.e. if some coins were encumbered by a smart contract the base layer doesn\u2019t understand, and then withdrawn from the second layer, those more complicated conditions could still be settled correctly on the base layer as the coins are withdrawn. The Missing Piece One thing that OP_CAT does not enable is updating a merkle tree root representing user balances off-chain verifiably. It can enable an already committed state to facilitate unilateral withdrawals, but that is because a whole section of the tree is actually put on-chain and verified. To update that root off-chain by definition means you are not putting the data on-chain. This represents a problem. There is no way with just CAT to efficiently verify that all changes to the merkle tree were authorized properly by the relevant users. Someone(s) has to be trusted, and by the nature of things capable of spending the UTXO however and wherever they want, to efficiently replace an old state root with a new one to represent all off-chain balance changes. A new opcode in addition to OP_CAT, such as OP_ZKVERIFY, would be needed to do this in a trustless manner. This wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world without OP_ZKVERIFY though. The entity updating the merkle root for off-chain transfers could be an n-of-n multisig, with 100% of the participants required to sign off on any root changes. This boils down to the same trust model as BitVM based pegs, where as long as a single honest participant exists, no one's funds can be stolen. It is a stark improvement over existing BitVM designs however when it comes to the withdrawal process. In BitVM pegs, users do not have a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. Peg operators must be trusted to fulfill user withdrawals, knowing that they can claim back funds they have spent doing so relatively trustlessly from the BitVM peg. While the incentives of this are very solid, it still does require users essentially getting permission from someone else to exit the system, they cannot do it on their own. With CatVM, users can claim back their funds unilaterally, and an operator is not required to front their own liquidity to process withdrawals. Wrapping Up Overall, the design is incomplete in terms of construction. This is not something I would call a Layer 2 in and of itself. It is the core of one, the mechanism and structure for how funds are locked into a Layer 2, and the process for how users can withdraw their funds. It definitely has a lot of flexibility and usefulness to it. In the worst case scenario, users do not need anyone\u2019s permission to safely claim their funds back on-chain. It also allows more flexible programmability of funds, while still carrying the enforcement of those conditions to the base layer in the event of worst case unilateral exits. If one day we do eventually get something like OP_ZKVERIFY, the off-chain state progression can become an actually trustless process. I don\u2019t expect any concrete demos in the near future, but it definitely is a sound idea in my opinion, and something worth considering. It also shows that the wizards are doing a little more than just pumping stupid jpegs.","article_summary":"A breakdown of Taproot Wizard's recent CatVM proposal, what it actually is, and what it could be useful for.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-the-heck-is-catvm","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T22:30:00Z","categories":["catvm","op_cat","technical","opinion"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-the-heck-is-catvm","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Breaking Down The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Implications and Predictions for Bitcoin Miners","author":"El Sultan Bitcoin","article_detailed_content":"The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal occurrence, is scheduled for April, 19 2024. This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining. Economic Outlook and Market Predictions After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network. Luxor\u2019s Hashrate Index Research Team projects about 3-7% of Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate could go offline if Bitcoin\u2019s price maintains its current level. However, if prices fall, up to 16% of the hashrate could become economically unviable, depending on the trajectory of Bitcoin prices and transaction fees post-halving. The hashrate, a critical security measure for Bitcoin, might adjust along with difficulty levels to align with the new economic realities. Luxor\u2019s analysis suggests different scenarios where the network's hashrate could end up ranging from 639 EH/s to 674 EH/s by year's end, reflecting adjustments to the new earning potential post-halving. ASIC Pricing and Breakeven Points Post-halving, the profitability of different ASIC models will become crucial as the mining reward drops. Lower rewards mean that only the most efficient machines will be able to operate profitably if the price of Bitcoin does not see a significant increase. For instance, according to Luxor\u2019s projections, next-generation ASICs like the S19 XP and M30S++ might have breakeven power costs ranging from $0.07/kWh to $0.15/kWh, depending on post-Halving hashprice. This shift in profitability will likely lead to a repricing of ASIC machines. Historical data suggests that ASIC prices are highly correlated with hashprice; therefore, the anticipated reduction in hashprice will prompt a downward adjustment in ASIC values. This will particularly impact older and less efficient models, potentially accelerating their phase-out from the market. The Role of Custom ASIC Firmware Post-Halving To combat reduced profitability, miners are increasingly turning to custom ASIC firmware to improve the efficiency of their hardware. Firmware like LuxOS and BraiinsOS can enhance the performance of machines by optimizing their power usage and hashrate output, thus lowering the breakeven point for electricity costs. For example, underclocking an S19 with custom firmware could extend its operational viability by reducing its power draw, thereby maintaining profitability even at lower hashprices. Public miners, in particular, are adopting custom firmware to boost the efficiency of their fleets. Companies like CleanSpark and Marathon have reported using custom solutions to enhance their operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to grow as more miners seek to maximize their output and minimize costs in the face of decreasing block rewards. 2024 Bitcoin Halving and Beyond The 2024 Bitcoin Halving is set to reshape the mining landscape significantly, just as previous halvings have. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, the event will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities. Miners who plan strategically, taking into account both economic forecasts and operational efficiencies, will be better positioned to navigate the post-halving environment. For those in the Bitcoin mining industry, staying informed and adaptable will be key to leveraging the halving event as an opportunity rather than a setback. With the right preparations, particularly in ASIC management and firmware optimization, miners can continue to thrive even under tightened economic conditions.

Singapore-based Matrixport expects mainland Chinese investors to pour up to $25 billion into Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETFs via the Southbound Stock Connect program. Thielen echoed this sentiment, stating the ETFs could yield $25 billion if fully accessible to Chinese investors. However, he noted that Chinese participation may take at least six months due to evolving regulations. Nonetheless, the ETFs mark a milestone for Bitcoin adoption in Asia. They provide regulated exposure to bitcoin, opening the assets to a broader range of investors. The funds' unique in-kind redemption feature also makes them competitive globally.

Against the backdrop of global discussions on Bitcoin regulation\u2014and coinciding with a solar eclipse\u2014the summit aimed to be a beacon of reason and a catalyst for action in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. The Bitcoin Policy Summit boasted a remarkable turnout, with more than 45,000 individuals tuning into the livestream. Among the 500+ in-person attendees were representatives from 26 universities, 75 government officials, and 250 public policy professionals. The summit also garnered attention from over a dozen media outlets. Notably, elected leaders from both major political parties were present, alongside representatives from prominent organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Department, Department of Commerce, Treasury Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The summit, with its diverse mix of voices and perspectives, shed light on the pressing need for smart and informed decision-making in the realm of digital asset policy. While Bitcoin symbolizes financial freedom and empowerment, it also brings its fair share of challenges, from concerns about money laundering to energy usage. The summit tackled these complex issues head-on, offering insights into the multifaceted world of Bitcoin as it relates to mining, geopolitics, the future of money, and human rights. The Bitcoin Policy Summit witnessed a significant turnout of policymakers committed to safeguarding the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and addressing its associated challenges. Figures such as Senators Marsha Blackburn, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cynthia Lummis, alongside House members Wiley Nickel, Tom Emmer, and Patrick McHenry, lent their expertise and bipartisan support to the discussions. Their active involvement not only enriched the conversation but also signaled a united effort to ensure that digital asset policies foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold transparency and accountability. One of the most striking features of the summit was its focus on the intersection of Bitcoin and human rights, with speakers like Felix Maradiaga, 2024 Nobel Prize Nominee and prominent human rights advocate from Nicaragua; Anna Chekhovich, financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) founded by Alexei Navalny; Roya Mahboob, Afghan entrepreneur and women's rights advocate; and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian human rights activist. Their combined emphasis on Bitcoin\u2019s critical role in defending human rights and freedom of expression in the face of dictators and oppressive regimes shed light on broader roles for digital assets that many in the United States may not have previously considered. Furthermore, the summit stressed the importance of taking a global perspective on digital asset regulation to protect human rights. In a world where digital assets know no borders, fragmented regulatory approaches risk creating loopholes and undermining financial integrity. Human rights activists stressed the need to protect privacy, free speech, and equal access to financial services for all, regardless of where they are. The conference hall buzzed with anticipation as attendees dispersed into three specialized rooms for afternoon deep dive tracks: Mining & Energy, Geopolitics, and Future of Money. Concurrent programming featured keynotes such as \u201cA Climate Scientist\u2019s Perspective on Bitcoin\u201d by Margot Paez, BPI fellow and PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. Fireside chats and panels included \"Bitcoin & Financial Inclusion\" with Chastity Murphy from the U.S. Treasury, and \"Countering Digital Authoritarianism\" featuring renowned writer Roger Huang, author of \u2018Bitcoin and China\u2019, and Jorge Jrsaissati, President of the Organization for Economic Inclusion. One of my personal highlights from the Bitcoin Policy Summit was engaging in a fireside chat with Senator Marsha Blackburn from my home state of Tennessee. We explored the connection between Bitcoin and her advocacy for consumer rights and privacy. Additionally, we discussed Tennessee's growing prominence as a Bitcoin hub and her stance on CBDCs (spoiler: she\u2019s not a fan). It's truly inspiring to witness elected leaders championing both monetary and digital freedoms, reinforcing their commitment to safeguarding these fundamental rights. Another standout moment occurred during a post-summit dinner with Felix Maradiaga and his wife, Berta Valle. Felix, who endured four years of imprisonment under a Nicaraguan dictator, shared firsthand accounts of political dissent and activism. These experiences underscore the importance of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network, providing resilience against oppression. The 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington D.C. served as a crucial platform for educating policymakers and advocating for Bitcoin's role in shaping a freer and more sustainable financial future. Through candid dialogue, diverse perspectives, and collaborative efforts across sectors, participants witnessed the transformative potential of Bitcoin to advance global human rights, bolster national security, and accelerate renewable energy adoption. As we reflect on the insights garnered from the summit, let's seize this pivotal moment to shape a regulatory landscape that not only fosters innovation and economic growth but also champions human dignity, justice, and liberty.

For more information on services offered, custody products, and the relationship between Unchained and Bitcoin Magazine, please visit our website. Bitcoin tumbled below $60,000 over the weekend, fueled by conflict between Iran and Israel, sparking fears that escalation could lead to Western involvement in a war in the Middle East\u2014an all too common occurrence in the 21st century that would lead to increased inflationary pressures and disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets. While skeptics were quick to mock bitcoin\u2019s near instantaneous selloff in reaction to the news of conflict, ironically bitcoin was one of the only global asset open for trading on the weekend, with equities, commodities, and bond strategists alike turning their eyes to the bitcoin chart in an attempt to assess what the damage might be to global markets upon the Sunday night trading open. Turning away from geopolitics, this brief article will take a look at the latest in on-chain spending behavior and Bitcoin derivative markets, to analyze whether the current dip from the highs of $73,000 is typical of a standard bull market correction or more so a cyclical peak. Many preconceived notions of a typical Bitcoin cycle have already been shattered with new highs being broken before the upcoming halving taking place on block 840,000. So let's evaluate and take a look at where we are, and how these conditions and investor behavior also inform what might come next. We\u2019ll be looking at both on-chain data, to analyze the actions of incumbent Bitcoin hodlers and new market entrants alike, before taking a look at the derivatives market to gauge whether there is anything worrisome in regards to the leverage currently present in the market. Unchained is the Official Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine. Click here to learn more about Unchained's bitcoin financial services and receive exclusive discounts on Unchained vault, Signature and IRA. First, we\u2019ll take a look at a metric called the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, coined and created by TXMC, which compares near-term spending behavior to the yearly average, as a means of detecting overheated and undervalued markets. A brief look at this signals that the bull market is well underway, and may have even peaked. The exact calculation of the metric, for those curious, is the ratio of two daily moving averages (30, 365) of Value Days Destroyed (Coin Days Destroyed * Price), then adjusted for supply inflation to account for changes in spender behavior over time. We can attribute approximately one third of the spending as a simple transfer of coins from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to new ETF participants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. However, the raw data is just that\u2014the raw data, and we can see there has been a significant amount of spending that\u2019s occurred with the push to new highs. A closer look at the metric, however, shows that this spending activity is cooling off, and there is historical precedent for new highs in the market in both the 2017 and 2021 cycle - this is merely a data point to keep in mind. Next, taking a look at the interplay between HODLers and new entrants, viewed through the lens of short-term and long-term holders, we can see that during a typical bull market, revisits to the cost basis of short-term holders are not only typical but also quite healthy. Additionally, the ability for this approximate price level to serve as support is a characteristic of bull markets, with the inverse being true in a bear market, where this psychological level of average short-term holder price (cost basis) often serves as ironclad psychological and technical resistance. As for where that level is today, approximately $58,500, which means that by no means is a visit to this level a guarantee or certainty, but rather it is something that is perfectly in the norm of expected activity in a bull market. Turning our attention to the derivatives market, there has been a healthy flush of leverage and speculative froth across the market. Perpetual futures open in bitcoin terms are near the lowest levels seen since 2022, while futures have been trading at a slight discount to spot markets since the weekend flush lower. While there is no law or guarantee that this brings about higher prices immediately, similar positioning in the past has fostered the conditions for price appreciation, and when compared to the top-heavy speculative froth of a speculative premium in futures market pricing observed over the last month or so, it is a welcomed development. In terms of points of interest when eyeing the derivatives landscape, the buildup of liquidatable leverage above $70,000 continues to grow, with emboldened shorts looking to push price meaningfully below $60,000. While there is some leverage to be purged under the $60,000 level, the real prize for bears is under the $50,000 level. While certainly crazier things have happened in Bitcoin than a -33% pullback from all-time highs, spot demand is likely to be strong from $50,000, and a wipe of open interest and the start of a negative futures premium relative to spot markets hint at most of the pullback having already taken place. It would likely take a significant risk-off moment across the macro landscape for this to unfold, and any dip is likely to be fleeting given the perpetuating reality of the pace of fiscal deficit spending. Conclusion: This bull market has legs, and the current pullback from the highs, along with any future dips in the exchange rate, should be a welcomed development for investors with a sufficiently long time horizon who understand where this is all headed. Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals continue to improve, and pullbacks serve to purge leverage and weak handed speculators during secular bull markets. BTFD.

Private When Alexander \u201cAkin\u201d Fernandez first conceptualized Azteco over a decade ago, he simply wanted to make bitcoin easier to obtain. He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute. Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you don\u2019t have to disclose your identity to do so, not to mention the process of buying a voucher is quick and easy. Azteco offers both on-chain and Lightning capabilities, giving users the choice to redeem their BTC on either the Bitcoin base chain or the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payments network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. According to an estimate from Fernandez, over one million people have already purchased Azteco vouchers. But his aspirations are far beyond the already-impressive number of vouchers thus sold: he has his sights set on Azteco servicing a customer base of over 30 times that, as Azteco does its part in \u201cnormalizing\u201d Bitcoin. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: Where did the inspiration for Azteco come from? Akin Fernandez: It came from my own experience of finding out that getting bitcoin is very difficult. I realized it doesn't have to be like this. We could use a familiar system like a top-up voucher, which billions of people use to top up their mobile phones, and apply that process to getting bitcoin. All we have to do is build a software, put distribution in place, and then it should just work. And lo and behold, it does. Corva: Did you have a particular customer base in mind when you designed Azteco? Fernandez: Yes, I had myself in mind. I wanted to be able to get bitcoin without having to make any kind of fuss or effort to do it. I wanted to be able to go to the supermarket, buy $20 worth of bitcoin and put it straight onto my wallet. And I'm not unique. I could assume that there were other people who were like me who could understand the proposition and the ease of use and who would take to it like a duck to water. You find that with inventions, many times they come about because people are solving problems for themselves, not as a means to get rich or for any reason other than to solve their own problems. And because people are similar, they solve other people's problems, too. Corva: Speaking of your own experience. I\u2019ve read that you were unbanked for a period of time. Is this true and could you expand on it, if so? Fernandez: Well, I became unbanked for a reason that I, until this day, don't know. I went down to \u201cmy\u201d bank to cash a check, and they couldn't find my account in the system. I had received no communication from them in writing or in any way. All of a sudden, I had no bank account. So, for many years after that I didn't have access to credit cards or anything that other people in the West take for granted. This taught me a very, very big lesson about how difficult it is to do anything in the 21st century if you don't have access to banking facilities. You can forget shopping online. You can forget any kind of convenience of going into a store and paying with a card. All of that goes away. So, when I was working on Azteco, it was made clear to me how powerful a tool it was going to be, because, with Bitcoin, you cannot be unbanked by any third party. You have control over your synthetic money. Corva: I\u2019ve heard you use this term \u201csynthetic money\u201d before, and you\u2019ve discussed how we shouldn\u2019t refer to bitcoin as actual money. Why is it important that we do this? Fernandez: It's important because it's true. Bitcoin is not money \u2014 it's a database. Can it be used as money? Of course. It can be used as very, very good money. It's a good simulation of money. But it doesn't have to be money for it to be useful. Also, if you call bitcoin money, all the regulations that the state has imposed on actual money can be superimposed or brushed over Bitcoin inappropriately, making it hard to use and slower to spread. So, it's very important to tell the truth about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has taken so long to get into every nook and cranny because there's been this misconstruing of it as money. WhatsApp reached a billion people in four and a half years. That's the kind of spread into people's phones that we'd expect if the rails to get onto Bitcoin were frictionless, just like they are with WhatsApp. The fact that Bitcoin has not reached that number of people indicates that there's something wrong in the way people are thinking about it, and so it's important for us to think about it correctly. Corva: How many people is Azteco reaching? Put another way, how many vouchers did Azteco sell in Q3 or Q4 of 2023? Fernandez: The actual numbers I don't have at hand being the CEO and not the CFO. But we had our biggest ever month last month. I was told this yesterday. The number of vouchers we're selling is increasing, and this is a direct result of our increasing our distribution and also the sentiment towards Bitcoin changing on a global scale. We're the easiest way to get bitcoin. When people discover us, they say two things: \u201cFirst of all, why isn't everything as easy as this?\u201d and \u201cHow come I haven't heard of this before?\u201d Things are synergizing and coming together to bring us to a point where we're a global force for good and for getting Bitcoin to the people who need it the most \u2014 the unbanked and the people who don't have access to financial rails or people who just don't want to be the victims of the financial rails. The old school crop of Bitcoin businesses that have been serving people over the last 10 years all believe that Bitcoin is money and make it very difficult to get an account. Everybody's so inured to the idea of having a bank account or an account of any kind, whether it's through email or anything else. The assumption immediately is, \u201cWell, of course, I have to have an account in order to use this service.\u201d With Bitcoin, that's not true, though. No accounts are necessary. [Some] wallet companies are doing this correctly. One of them is Samourai Wallet and another is Wallet of Satoshi where you don\u2019t need to open an account to use your own money. They\u2019re saying you shouldn\u2019t be able to use bitcoin without having an account. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do in the EU. Corva: We\u2019re doing it here in the US with the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA), too, the bill that Elizabeth Warren drafted. Fernandez: These people are oath breakers. They\u2019ve sworn an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution, which guarantees the free speech of every single American. Bitcoin is speech. It's a database where speech is written down and stored and transmitted from one person to another. And lest anyone think that I'm picking on the Democrats and not the Republicans, Cynthia Lummis has written an absolutely appalling bill that I took great pleasure in tearing to pieces on my blog. They don\u2019t understand what their role is as a public servant. A servant is not in control of its masters. A servant is obedient to the electorate. It\u2019s not their business to tell people you have to KYC to use bitcoin. Corva: On the topic of America and KYC-free bitcoin, do you see people using Azteco because they want KYC-free bitcoin? Fernandez: In order for the American market to be cracked, the service has to be explained. People have to be deprogrammed. They don\u2019t understand that bitcoin is not a vehicle to make you earn more fiat. People need to be broken out of these bad habits to be shown that actually there are better ways to get things done. The perfect example of this is WhatsApp. Before WhatsApp, people used to pay for SMS messages, while the idea of this is now unthinkable. A similar process has to happen with Bitcoin where you can send money to family members without having to go through a third party or pay exorbitant fees or identify yourself or anything like that. With Bitcoin, you [also] get other subtle benefits. Hyperinflation is starting to kick in and people are starting to realize that there\u2019s something wrong with the money. People find it very difficult to go to the root cause of the prices going up at McDonalds. Let\u2019s say they did find out the cause, what could they do about it? They could go and get bitcoin, but it\u2019s several steps down before these people are going to see bitcoin as the answer. Corva: I agree. Fernandez: Also, the current crop of businesses \u2014 big businesses like Binance, Coinbase \u2014 are synonymous with bitcoin. Azteco needs to be synonymous with getting bitcoin. The vast majority of people on earth are not rich. They don't have $100,000 to spend on bitcoin. They live day to day. Since these people are not investors and they don't have spare money to keep in bitcoin in the hopes that it's going to go up \u2014 which of course it will \u2014 they need to have bitcoin as daily money for everyday spending. Once you start talking about these things, the business opportunities and models start to just fall out of the conversation. All of these Cynthia Lummises and Elizabeth Warrens prevent these business models from emerging because they're regulating something they have no business regulating. Corva: Speaking of other businesses, I\u2019ve heard you say good things about Machankura, a protocol that makes it easier for Africans to use bitcoin in a KYC manner, and that it serves as a compliment to Azteco. What other companies in the Bitcoin space are a compliment to Azteco? Fernandez: Ethical Bitcoin wallets are a good compliment. By ethical, I mean Samourai Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi. I know that some people don\u2019t like Wallet of Satoshi because the architecture on the backend is not to their liking, but these people don\u2019t run businesses \u2014 they don\u2019t know how difficult it is to do these things. The newest entrant to this is the Bitkey wallet. This Bitkey wallet is absolutely unbelievable. They've thought about this properly. The user interface and user experience \u2014 it's going to make everybody change their game. I've been saying for a long time that somebody like Apple, Microsoft or some other company is going to get into Bitcoin and bring all of that user experience thinking to the process of using Bitcoin. The current crop of companies have not thought about user experience. Jack Dorsey\u2019s Bitkey has been a kick in the backside to a lot of people who realize that we can't just carry on doing what we want to do and expecting people to just accept it \u2014 the idea that you have to write down your mnemonic before you receive your first transaction. It\u2019s completely crazy. If Apple developed its own Bitcoin wallet or clones one of the Bitcoin wallets out there, Bitcoin is going to be exposed to people in a way that's very easy to understand, very easy to consume. There will be the new generation of Bitcoin users for whom Bitcoin is totally normal \u2014 not threatening, intimidating or frightening. Corva: The same way that using WhatsApp or Uber is normal now\u2026 Fernandez: That's exactly right. Bitcoin has to become boring.","article_summary":"Alexander \u201cAkin\u201d Fernandez\u2019s Azteco provides Bitcoin users around the world a way to get their hands on \u201csynthetic money\u201d without revealing their identity, creating a world in which bitcoin is so ubiquitous and easy to use that it\u2019s boring.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/azteco-is-helping-millions-buy-bitcoin-without-sharing-their-identity","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T02:40:48Z","categories":["business","founders","azteco","bitcoin","lightning"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/azteco-is-helping-millions-buy-bitcoin-without-sharing-their-identity","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"},{"article_title":"The Weekly Reorg: Bitcoin Fashion Week","author":"Alex Bergeron","article_detailed_content":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week. Amongst other things, Mezo, a \u201cBitcoin economic layer\u201d came out of stealth with a $21 million fundraising round. Alpen Labs announced a $10.6 million bankroll to bootstrap a Bitcoin-native zero-knowledge infrastructure. Another posse of blockchain designers, including the folks at Starkware, got together and launched the L2O Consortium \u201cto set standards for trustless applications and Layer 2s.\u201d Of course, nobody knows what this all means, but it\u2019s provocative. It gets the people going, the capital frothing, and the industry buzzing. Eight-figure seed rounds are getting thrown around and some pretty major venture players are making a comeback. Almost every day, a new layer is announced or some \u201cBitcoin-native\u201d protocol you\u2019ve never heard about announces that its users have locked a bazillion dollars worth of bitcoins into their \u201ctrustless\u201d multi-sig protocol. So it goes in a bull market, I guess. Curiously, some of the people involved will admit it feels more like performance art than legitimate engineering. Remember the Rick Owens freak runway shows? It\u2019s flashy alright but who\u2019s going to wear this stuff? Keep in mind most of the new gadgets being proposed have yet to take off their training wheels anywhere they\u2019ve been implemented. Rollups on Ethereum, for example, are still just dressed-up multi-sig. Similarly, this new crop of Bitcoin-adjacent protocol seems content launching with either no product or \u201cdecentralization on the roadmap.\u201d Under the layers of vapid marketing and technical mumbo jumbo, it\u2019s hard to find a trust model that is much better than the simple and often maligned Liquid federated sidechain. Forget unilateral exit, most of the \u201cLayer 2s\u201d on offer today can hardly qualify for the term under our admittedly loose policy here at Bitcoin Magazine. To make matters worse, variants of proof-of-stake have crept into the design space despite Ethereum\u2019s abysmal performance since its transition. Not surprisingly, the conversation has already devolved into ponzinomics to bootstrap the speculative flywheel. Colloquially styled \u201cpoints,\u201d a new token contraption has burst onto the scene and is all the rage amongst the designer crowd. This new liquidity farming fad requires users to deposit their bitcoins (and those of friends and family) somewhere in exchange for, you guessed it, yield. They\u2019re calling it gamification this time around. I think it\u2019s peak crypto nihilism. Fast fashion has officially made it into Bitcoin! The Emperor Has No Clothes? Speaking of catwalks and clownishly dressed individuals, the crew at Taproot Wizards recently unleashed pandemonium on the aspiring Layer 2 community by going at its most prized science project, BitVM. My esteemed colleague Shinobi put together a decent recap of the event. I wont bother you with the technical details but, of course, the claims remain hotly contested to this day. At least a dozen new companies\u2019 fate hangs in the balance here so you can imagine the smell when they were publicly outed to the fashion police. Although I\u2019m partial to the wizards\u2019 arguments, we should probably hold off on writing the obituary for BitVM. Jumping through liquidity hoops appears to be one of the pervasive tradeoffs one has to make when designing trust-minimized protocols on top of Bitcoin. Lightning has given us inbound liquidity headaches for years. Proposals like Ark have been dismissed because of the massive UTXOs operators have to fund. Maybe BitVM bridges can be designed to mitigate the upfront liquidity requirements of operators. At least, the issue is probably not enough for everyone to drop everything and go home. The unfortunate takeaway from this saga is that everyone involved comes away looking a bit amateurish. Despite claims to the contrary, some due diligence was clearly skipped. The issue could\u2019ve been run through a bit more collective brain cells before publishing and you can tell the targets all felt pretty blindsided by the announcement. To tie this all up, the wizards have just come out with their derivative proposal. It\u2019s hard not to get the impression that this was a bit of a setup motivated by marketing purposes. Then again, they\u2019re grown men wearing wizard hats, what do you expect? On the other hand, it is a valid issue and the response from \u201cteam\u201d BitVM hasn\u2019t been exactly gracious either. You\u2019d expect thicker skin from researchers who have been around the block. Banning people from a Telegram working group and hand-waving away the entire premise does not serve the interest of the community they are building for. They can disagree with the conclusions but the obvious outcome is that the audience and interest in BitVM have now grown beyond the small engineering circles where it was fomenting. Many have suggested it was probably the first time the mechanism was communicated in an accessible way. It was a missed opportunity for its advocates to leverage this attention and steer it their way if they thought the project was misrepresented. Hopefully, this is all just a failed dress rehearsal because I don\u2019t see how this is very inspiring for anyone seriously interested in contributing to this space. A grand finale Of course, a circus show isn\u2019t complete without the clown act. The hottest protocol designer in town is preparing to showcase his latest line just in time for the halving this Friday. Runes, a protocol for fungible tokens, is probably the most anticipated drop since the Jordan 1s. As we speak, hundreds of users are syncing up Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives in preparation for the festivities. The blockchain is expecting a record crowd for this event so be advised that tickets could get expensive. As for myself, I\u2019ll probably just watch from my balcony in the comfort of my safe and ever-reliable Bitcoin jeans. Tick tock, next block.","article_summary":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T02:13:55Z","categories":["technical","culture","layer 2"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin DevCon To Take Place Alongside Bitcoin Asia  ","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","article_detailed_content":"In addition to showcasing the world\u2019s most important Bitcoin companies and leaders of today, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for the next generation of Bitcoin startups to meet, build, and get in front of the community.

However, while we\u2019re all keenly aware of BTC\u2019s impact on financial markets (a more or less permanent fixture of the news cycle), we often forget to take a step back and look at how this new frontier affects real change and real people. For those historically marginalized by traditional banking due to barriers like poor credit or lack of accessibility, BTC has emerged as a vital financial tool. Its impact is most profound in developing countries, where access to banking still poses a challenge for many. Here, Bitcoin serves as more than a currency or an investment; it's a means to engage in essential financial activities, such as sending and receiving money, that would otherwise be out of reach. Forget, at least for a minute, the speculative potential in terms of financial gain\u2014the true value of Bitcoin lies in its potential to level the financial playing field, offering access to financial tools that were previously exclusive to those with more established economic backgrounds. Amid its fluctuating value, the enduring promise of Bitcoin is its contribution to financial inclusivity, making it a beacon of hope for more equitable access to financial services worldwide. Historical context of Bitcoin and financial inclusivity Bitcoin was born out of the financial turmoil of the late 2000s, with its creator(s) aiming to forge a decentralized currency that could bypass traditional banking systems and help society at large traverse a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. This vision was not just technical but deeply ideological, seeking to empower individuals with financial autonomy. At its core, Bitcoin promised to make financial services accessible to anyone with internet access, regardless of their standing with conventional financial institutions. This promise has seen tangible realization in countries like Nigeria, where traditional banking services are out of reach for many. In Nigeria, Bitcoin has become more than a speculative asset\u2014for instance, with the country's significant diaspora, Bitcoin facilitates remittances, enabling Nigerians living abroad to send money home more efficiently and at lower costs compared to traditional banking services. In Argentina, Bitcoin has emerged as a crucial financial tool amidst the country's ongoing economic challenges, including high inflation rates and currency devaluation. For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers a more stable store of value compared to the national currency, the Argentine peso, which has suffered from significant depreciation over the years. A similar trend can be noticed in Ghana, where the annual inflation rate is predicted to land in the 13% to 17% range in 2024. In Venezuela, a country grappling with political instability and economic crises, Bitcoin has found a unique role beyond just a means of preserving wealth against hyperinflation. Here, Bitcoin is being utilized to support microfinance initiatives and charitable donations, directly impacting the lives of those in need. Organizations and platforms leveraging cryptocurrency can bypass traditional financial systems, which are often inaccessible or unreliable for the country's impoverished populations, to provide direct financial assistance. Moreover, for entrepreneurs and small business owners the world over, it offers a means to engage in international transactions without the need for bank accounts or the risk of currency devaluation. It\u2019s both a hedge against crisis and a vessel of freedom against authoritarian regimes, but the decentralization schtick isn\u2019t The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing the digital currency, BTC ETFs offer a familiar, regulated avenue for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin space. Previously, the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin deterred many institutional investors. However, with the advent of ETFs and other regulated investment products, these entities can now participate in the cryptocurrency market, bringing with them substantial capital inflows and increased legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, which will only increase with further adoption. This institutional foray into Bitcoin has a dual impact. On one hand, it introduces a level of stability and liquidity previously unseen, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. On the other, it represents a shift from Bitcoin's original ethos of decentralization and democratization of finance. Another point to consider is that institutional interest isn\u2019t limited to private, for-profit enterprises\u2014with countries like El Salvador, which recently took custody of its national Bitcoin treasury showcasing that, slowly but surely, the general attitude of governments towards cryptocurrencies is also changing with the times. Potential impacts of institutionalization on accessibility On the one hand, these developments can enhance Bitcoin's appeal by contributing to market stability and reducing volatility\u2014a key concern that has deterred a broader demographic from embracing cryptocurrencies. The entry of institutional investors can also increase liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially making it a more reliable asset for individuals and businesses worldwide. However, the flip side of institutionalization is the potential increase in barriers to entry for marginalized groups. The very essence of Bitcoin's appeal to these groups is its accessibility: the ability to participate in the financial system with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection. As regulatory frameworks become more stringent and the market more institutionalized, the processes for acquiring and using Bitcoin could become more complex. Requirements such as rigorous identity verification and compliance with financial regulations, while necessary for fraud prevention and financial security, could inadvertently sideline those without formal identification or those living in regions with less regulatory clarity. Moreover, the shift towards institutionalization might lead to a concentration of wealth and power within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reminiscent of traditional financial systems. This concentration could undermine the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, making it less about empowering the individual and more about serving institutional interests. The challenge lies in finding a balance: leveraging institutional interest to bring stability and legitimacy to Bitcoin while ensuring that its revolutionary promise of financial inclusivity remains intact. Financial inclusion and cryptocurrency adoption Sub-Saharan Africa, with its blend of limited banking infrastructure and high mobile penetration, has emerged as a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. The region, marked by its smaller overall market size in terms of traditional financial metrics, shows a significantly high level of grassroots cryptocurrency usage. Nigeria, for example, not only ranks second on the Global Crypto Adoption Index but also leads Sub-Saharan Africa in raw transaction volume, as well as the world in P2P exchange trade volume ranking. Other countries like Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa also feature prominently on the index, underlining the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial instruments The adoption is driven largely by practical necessities rather than speculative interests, with cryptocurrencies serving as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. In Ghana, where inflation surged to its highest level in two decades at the tail end of 2022, and in other nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa facing similar economic challenges, cryptocurrencies have become an attractive means of preserving wealth. The shift towards digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, and more recently, stablecoins, reflects a broader search for financial stability and freedom Peer-to-peer transactions, especially prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa, account for a significant portion of crypto transactions, underscoring the region's unique position in the global crypto landscape. This high rate of P2P transactions is attributed to the everyday use of crypto for retail payments, remittances, and commercial transactions. The preference for crypto over traditional banking and financial services is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity in regions where local currencies are losing value, as seen in countries like Nigeria and Kenya Through bypassing traditional financial barriers, cryptocurrencies offer expanded finance options to underserved markets, exemplified by initiatives like Empowa and Pezesha in Mozambique and Kenya that utilize blockchain to facilitate real estate development and connect MSMEs with global lenders. Balancing institutional interest and financial inclusivity As Bitcoin continues to navigate the waters between grassroots empowerment and institutional adoption, its future landscape presents a dichotomy. On one side, increased institutional interest brings stability and credibility, potentially making Bitcoin a more viable and trusted financial asset globally. On the other, this shift could challenge the very inclusivity that has been a cornerstone of Bitcoin's appeal, particularly among minority groups and in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. To ensure that Bitcoin remains a tool for empowerment, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential pathway is the development of regulatory frameworks that encourage inclusivity. Regulations could be designed to protect consumers without stifling innovation or access to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the continued support and promotion of peer-to-peer platforms can empower individuals by facilitating direct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Conclusion As Bitcoin evolves amidst rising institutional interest, its foundational role as an agent of financial inclusivity faces both challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that Bitcoin continues to serve marginalized communities requires a delicate balance, blending the stability brought by institutional involvement with its potential as a democratizing force. One thing is certain\u2014the future of Bitcoin hinges in large part on maintaining its essence as a lifeline for financial empowerment across the globe. This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

This event will bring together prominent voices in the Bitcoin space including Barstool CEO Dave Portnoy, Strike CEO Jack Mallers, Bitcoin Magazine Institutional Lead Dylan LeClair, and Ten31 Managing Partner Matt Odell. This halving event \u2013 projected to occur between April 19, 2024 \u2013 will occur as Bitcoin reaches block 840,000, marking the point at which its relative supply issuance will drop below that of gold for the first time. Previous halvings have historically acted as a turning point in the market as the reduction in newly issued coins has been met with surging demand for the currency throughout each prior halving cycle. This time around, the halving has been preceded by a new all-time high, an occurrence that has never happened since Bitcoin\u2019s inception in January 2009. Between the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (arguably the most successful ETF debut in history) by major financial institutions, and a potential resurgence in inflation, the Bitcoin bulls are on parade driving the market higher into uncharted territory. Other guests slated to appear on the livestream are Bitcoin Magazine Chief Content Officer Pete Rizzo, Human Rights Foundation Director of Financial Freedom Christian Keroles, Simply Bitcoin Founder Nico Moran, Bitcoin Magazine Correspondent Isabella Santos, and Pomp Investments Founder Anthony Pompliano. Click here for more information on the Bitcoin Halving Livestream powered by Kraken In the countdown to Bitcoin\u2019s fourth epoch, Livestream guests will review the Top 21 Moments of the past four years, as voted on by Bitcoin Magazine readers. Top moments include the rise of the Laser Eyes meme, MicroStrategy unveiling of its bitcoin-based treasury strategy, and the notorious rise and fall of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. In partnership with Nitrobetting, Bitcoin Magazine will be awarding a 1 BTC prize pool for the Bitcoin Halving Challenge to contestants who most closely predict the price of the currency at Block 840,000. Viewers will be able to count down to the halving with some of the biggest names in the space and commemorate the growth of Bitcoin with a New Year\u2019s Eve-style celebration with Bitcoiners from around the world. The full roster of Livestream participants can be seen on www.BitcoinHalving.com and viewers can tune in on the Bitcoin Magazine YouTube channel, Twitter (X), LinkedIn, Rumble and Facebook. Bitcoin has come a long way since the last halving in 2020, and it\u2019s time to kick things up a notch as the world marches toward hyperbitcoinization.

For as long as humans have been organizing into social groups, we\u2019ve been hating on the group in the next valley. Even though we have much more in common with them than we would care to admit. It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. These differences aren\u2019t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can\u2019t even recall why they disliked one another in the first place. But it wasn\u2019t always that way: and it doesn\u2019t have to stay this way. There are signs that the rivalry that has polarized bitcoiners and ethereans is starting to thaw. If these frenemies can bury the hatchet and work together, it will make web3 a better place for everyone. From Divergence to Convergence It\u2019s easy to forget that Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin cut his teeth at Bitcoin Magazine and was a regular poster on the Bitcointalk forum. When the Ethereum ICO was held in 2014, funds were raised at a ratio of 2,000 ETH per BTC. It\u2019s also easy to forget that many of the use cases now synonymous with Ethereum have Bitcoin ancestors, such as NFT precursor Colored Coins. Even the concept of a Layer 2 has Bitcoin beginnings. But all that\u2019s ancient history now. BTC has assumed the mantle of store of value and global reserve currency, while ETH has become the fuel that launched 100 EVM chains and 10,000 tokens. Along the way, the continental drift pushing the two ecosystems apart has been expedited by Ethereum\u2019s move to Proof of Stake, leaving Bitcoin as the only top 20 coin aside from DOGE still wedded to Proof of Work. While the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are stark, they are not irreconcilable. One of the most fascinating aspects of the chains\u2019 evolving use cases is the way in which each has emulated the other. Ethereum is well on its way to becoming a somewhat stable store of value of its own, and looks poised to follow Bitcoin in receiving an ETF. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has belatedly spawned its own multi-chain and multi-token ecosystem thanks to Ordinals, BRC20, Runes, Stacks, and similar protocols. Bitcoin-native DeFi and NFTs are now a thing \u2013 even if most maximalists aren\u2019t on board. While it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin DeFi takes off, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s now more that unites the two chains than divides them. Bitcoin and Ethereum have moved in opposing directions over the years but their paths are finally starting to converge. Choose Tech, Not Tribalism Rather than arguing over whose tech trumps whose, or who implemented it first, there are clear benefits to the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities setting aside their differences. Just as globalism diminished petty tribalism (even if we simply swapped hating the guy in the next valley for hating internet strangers), the multi-chain era has rendered blockchain wars pointless. Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer isolated islands but interconnected hubs that routinely exchange value through bridges, portals, and wrappers. Isn\u2019t it time they started swapping developer talent too? The onus is on builders to find ways that both technology stacks can enhance one another. This is the key to scaling web3 and growing adoption. The rise of Ordinals has shown there is strong interest in utilizing the Bitcoin network as more than simply a means to store value. But building out further utility natively is complex since the network is not Turing complete by nature and its simplistic UTXO model and limited block space cannot handle complex data and calculations. While there have been many avenues explored for scaling Bitcoin, they all relied on a level of centralization until the Taproot upgrade which brought Schnorr Signature and MAST contracts. These upgrades have made it possible to design fully trustless bridges between the Bitcoin ecosystem and other networks, allowing for truly decentralized scaling solutions to be realized. The Ethereum ecosystem is already home to a robust suite of tools, smart contracts and applications that can be utilized to bring further compatibility and functionality to Bitcoin. It makes far more sense for Bitcoin to inherit the technology that already exists for certain functions rather than rebuild them from the ground up. Scale Bitcoin, Enhance Ethereum An obvious solution to scaling Bitcoin at the consumer level and building out new use cases is to utilize the functionality enabled by Taproot to create trustless bridges between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks. This can create a wave of new opportunities for both ecosystems by unlocking new ways for Bitcoin holders to engage while increasing the liquidity within Ethereum-based chains. While the possibility of utilizing EVM-compatible technology to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem is promising, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome will not be technological but cultural. While human ingenuity is boundless, our tendency to drag one another down like a bucket of crabs remains deeply ingrained. All crypto communities should strive to shun the cutthroat behaviors web2 was built on and find ways to collaborate. Only once this is done can web3 realize its full potential.

According to the posts, the SFC greenlit China Asset Management to offer spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in partnership with OSL and BOCI International. Other approved issuers include Harvest Global Investments, HashKey Capital, and Bosera Asset Management. The news mirrors the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which launched in January and quickly attracted over $200 billion in trading volume. Hong Kong's approval marks a milestone as Asia's first jurisdiction to embrace spot Bitcoin ETFs. The ETFs provide exposure to actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, offering investors direct access to the assets. They also present a regulated investment vehicle that mitigates some of Bitcoin's risks. By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its Bitcoin-friendly stance amid ongoing efforts to become a finance hub. The accessibly traded funds could stimulate significant retail and institutional demand. However, an official SFC announcement remains pending. Some of the social media posts sharing the alleged approval have since been deleted. The opacity around permissions could contribute to market uncertainty in the near term.

Click here to download a PDF of this 7,000 word essay on the origins of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1] The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology. Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T\u2019s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks. The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity. But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation\u2014 it\u2019s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph. This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed\u2014and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future. Outline I. Decentralized systems are markets II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods III. How can decentralized systems price computations? IV. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin V. Conclusion A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai\u2019s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts \u201cfrom exactly that point.\u201d In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin.

Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented: Digital currencies should be P2P networks Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation Money is created through an auction Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins Transactions are batched into blocks Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work All blocks are stored by all participants Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn\u2019t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi\u2019s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list. Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place? This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi\u2019s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money. I. Decentralized systems are markets Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words \u201cdecentralized\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces. For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the topology of their network diagrams, but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets. Distributed systems rely upon central authorities In this work, we take \u201cdistributed\u201d to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as \u201cnodes\u201d) which must communicate, typically over a network. Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems. But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system. Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes. The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system. Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required. In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system. Decentralized systems have no central authorities We take \u201cdecentralized\u201d to have a stronger meaning than \u201cdistributed\u201d: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for \u201cdecentralized\u201d is \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d (P2P). Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems: Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry\u2014anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority. Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage. Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert. These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin: \"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of\u2026 centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" - Nakamoto, 2008 But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority. Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi\u2019s nod to Gnutella, anyone who\u2019s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online. Satoshi didn\u2019t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam. Decentralized systems are governed through incentives The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating. Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they\u2019re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly. The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market\u2019s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system. II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility. Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges. Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true\u2014traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane. This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems. Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems. Computation is the first decentralized good The first example of a \u201cdecentralized good\u201d is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3] Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources\u2014they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce. The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital \u201cproof\u201d that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given \u201cdifficulty\u201d which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority. The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called \u201cproof-of-work\u201d.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo\u2019s phrase, \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource: \"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource.\" - Dwoak & Naor, 1993 In Dwork & Naor\u2019s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email. Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a \u201cpricing function\u201d because, by adjusting the difficulty, a \u201cpricing authority\u201d could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a \u201cprice\u201d for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam. Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature \u201cpricing function\u201d and \u201cpricing authority\u201d supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource\u2019s controller. In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations. Currency is the second decentralized good But computations aren\u2019t a good currency. The proofs used to \u201ctrade\u201d computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can\u2019t be reused for a different input. Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider. This constraint is useful \u2013 it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender\u2019s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can\u2019t be respent for sending a different email. But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren\u2019t fungible, they can\u2019t be re-spent,[5] and they don\u2019t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash. Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems: \"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use.\" - Adam Back, 1997 We don\u2019t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market. Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere \u201caccess control mechanism\u201d. Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers\u2026in the units of the currency that\u2019s being created! Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives. Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure. The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints. Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it: Computations through proof-of-work Units of the currency we\u2019re trying to build The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy\u2014the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself! The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo\u2019s bit gold and Wei Dai\u2019s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded. III. How can decentralized systems price computations? A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency. We don\u2019t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called \u201cprogress\u201d. Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn\u2019t be progress\u2014it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value. When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable \u201cprices\u201d and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function. But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty\u2014 as measured by the number of corresponding computations\u2014may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price? Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold: \"The main problem\u2026is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract \"compute cycle.\" \u2026Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold.\" - Szabo, 2005 A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations. Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the \u201ccost of computing\u201d. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money: 'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.\" - Dai, 1998 Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a \u201cstandard basket\u201d, which computer solves a given problem \u201cmost economically\u201d, or the cost of computation on the \u201copen market\u201d. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems! To be fair to Dai, he realized this: \"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol.\" - Dai, 1998 Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let\u2019s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo\u2019s insights into the problem. Use external markets Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be \u201csecurely timestamped\u201d: \"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on.\" - Szabo, 2005 Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases \u201csecurely\u201d and \u201cdistributed fashion\u201d are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) \u201coutside the system\u201d services for timestamping.[6] The time a unit of digital currency was created is important because it links the computations performed to real-world production cost. Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right\u2014the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation: \"\u2026However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 \"Inferring\u201d the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible: \"\u2026Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency: \"\u2026[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.\" - Szabo, 2005 To paraphrase Szabo, \u201cto assay the value of\u2026 bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp\u201d. The dealers defining \u201clarger units of approximately equal value\u201d are providing a similar pricing function as Dai\u2019s \u201cstandard basket of commodities\u201d. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger \u201cunits of approximately equal value\u201d by dealers in markets outside the network. To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw: \"\u2026The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address.\" - Szabo, 2005 Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money. Use internal markets Szabo\u2019s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it? Let\u2019s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi\u2019s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney\u2019s auction model[7]: \"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]\u2026 instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures. Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on. Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation. Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly.\" Dai, 1998 B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo\u2019s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other. But implementing Dai\u2019s proposal as written would be challenging: In the \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the \u201coptimal increase in the money supply for the next period\u201d. How \u201coptimal\u201d should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described. Regardless of what was planned, the \u201cBidding\u201d phase allows anyone to submit a \u201cbid\u201d to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money. Once bids are submitted, the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it\u2019s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted \u2013 when does the \u201cBidding\u201d phase end and the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase begin? These problems recur in the \u201cMoney ]reation\u201d phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of \u201chighest bids\u201d? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency? Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented. The root of this complexity is Dai\u2019s belief that the \u201coptimal\u201d rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create units of b-money by broadcasting a bid and then doing the corresponding proof-of-work. Both Szabo and Dai proposed using a market exchanging digital currency for computations yet neither bit gold nor b-money defined a monetary policy to regulate the supply of currency within this market.

Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi\u2019s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote: \"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\" - Satoshi, 2009 Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks\u2014with a concern about monetary policy. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The \u201coptimal\u201d rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi \u201cdiscovered\u201d bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. \u2014and not someone else. It\u2019s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply. A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It\u2019s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai\u2019s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let\u2019s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint. All 21M bitcoin already exist In b-money, each \u201cmoney creation period\u201d included a \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, in which users were expected to share their \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project. Satoshi was able to replace the recurring \u201cPlanning\u201d phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. This changes the semantics of bitcoin\u2019s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it\u2019s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that \u201cbitcoin miners create bitcoin\u201d. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they\u2019re buying it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t valuable because \u201cbitcoin are made from energy\u201d\u2014bitcoin\u2019s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. Let\u2019s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn\u2019t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus. Satoshi\u2019s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing \u201cPlanning\u201d phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin. Bitcoin is priced through consensus This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the \u201cBidding\u201d phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation \u201cbids\u201d from many different users. Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn\u2019t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi\u2019s predetermined schedule. The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8] The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi\u2019s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block: The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section): Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price. Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus \u201cblockchain\u201d containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain. Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy \u2013 just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented. This added complexity was removed by Satoshi\u2019s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Time closes all spreads In the \u201cComputation\u201d phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they\u2019d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller \u2013 but who is the buyer? In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner\u2019s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to \u201cexecute a trade\u201d but to pay the current asking price in computations. The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid\u2014the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network\u2019s current asking price. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008 Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin\u2019s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let\u2019s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn\u2019t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn\u2019t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. But Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo\u2019s \u201csecure timestamping protocol.\u201d Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a \u201cdistributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,\u201d and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world \u201ctimechain\u201d rather than \u201cblockchain\u201d to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work market.[10] Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations. Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time. A standing order creates consensus The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the \u201cMoney creation\u201d phase of b-money. User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the \u201chighest bids\u2026in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created\u201d in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the \u201cByzantine generals\u201d or sometimes the \u201cdouble-spend\u201d problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem \u2013 socalled \u201cByzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms\u201d\u2014require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network\u2019s current asking price\u2014 nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner\u2019s resources. Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin\u2019s market has no phases\u2014it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network. This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] We established in previous sections that bitcoin\u2019s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! Moreover, this new \u201cNakamoto consensus\u201d only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing. IV. Conclusion B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi\u2019s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin\u2019s implementation. There is a lot more to bitcoin\u2019s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the \u201cprimary\u201d market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.

In particular, Ryan Gentry, Will Cole and Stephen Hall met with me weekly to debate these ideas. I would not have been able to overcome countless false starts without their contributions and their support. Ryan also helped me begin talking about these ideas publicly in our Bitcoin 2021 talk. Afsheen Bigdeli, Allen Farrington, Joe Kelly, Gigi, Tuur Demeester, and Marty Bent, have all encouraged me over the years and provided valuable feedback. I must also apologize to Allen for turning out to be such a lousy collaborator. Finally, Michael Goldstein may be better known for his writing & memes, but I\u2019d like to thank him for the archival work he does at the Nakamoto Institute to keep safe the history of digital currencies.

[5] Hal Finney\u2019s RPOW project was an attempt at creating transferable proofs-of-work but bitcoin doesn\u2019t use this concept because it doesn't treat computations as currency. As we\u2019ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. [6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. [7] Dai\u2019s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi\u2019s white paper, available: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt [8]There are two simplifications being made here: a.

If you manage a large pool of Bitcoin and you take fees for doing so, then why would you not reinvest some of that into the underlying infrastructure?\u201d For this reason, Bitwise, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (ticker: BITB), committed to donating 10% of its ETF fee profits to three different nonprofits that fund Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 OpenSats, Brink and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) \u2014 for 10 years. \u201cBrink, OpenSats and HRF were the most established nonprofits with a track record of funding Bitcoin devs \u2014 they had the proof of work, so to speak,\u201d Kim told Bitcoin Magazine. VanEck, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name VanEck Bitcoin Trust (ticker: HODL), also sees the value in supporting Bitcoin Core developers. Hence, it promised to contribute 5% of HODL profits to Brink and it made an initial $10,000 donation to the organization. \u201cWe believe TradFi stands to gain from the efforts of Bitcoin's Core contributors,\u201d Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAs we stand to profit from Bitcoin\u2019s price increase, it makes sense that we also give back to the work of the innovators who make the chain possible,\u201d he added. Given that it\u2019s only sensible for spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to give back Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 those who support and further the underlying asset for their financial product \u2014 which will be next to follow Bitwise and VanEck\u2019s lead? The development of Bitcoin and open-source scaling solutions for the protocol could benefit significantly from more of these major financial institutions donating even a small portion of the profits from their spot Bitcoin ETF fees.","article_summary":"Currently, less than 20% of the financial institutions that issued spot Bitcoin ETFs give back to Bitcoin Core developers.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-support-btc-developers-bitwise-and-vaneck","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-13T02:22:26Z","categories":["business","bitcoin core","bitwise","news","developers","spot bitcoin etf","vaneck"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-support-btc-developers-bitwise-and-vaneck","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3NzYxMzkzMTI1MDE1/educating-the-next-wave-of-bitcoin-developers.jpg"},{"article_title":"6 Common Pitfalls of Self-Directed and Checkbook Bitcoin IRAs","author":"Jessy Gilger","article_detailed_content":"Originally published on Unchained.com.

You don\u2019t often see the term \u201cRoth IRA\u201d trending online, but in 2021, tech investor Peter Thiel made headlines for his $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA piggy bank. How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny. \u201cThiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.\u201d \u2013 ProPublica (2021) Let\u2019s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures. The different IRA structures The different IRA structures can behave in an \u201cevery square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares\u201d kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA. Brokerage and Bank IRAs Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The Unchained IRA is closest to this structure in this hierarchy. Self-directed IRA (SDIRA) A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn\u2019t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that are not allowed (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.). Checkbook IRA Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (\u201ccheckbook control\u201d). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA. Non-checkbook self-directed IRA A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA 1. Liquidity Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy. 2. Formation and legal structure When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account. With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA. 3. Misreporting transactions Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions. At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit fair market valuation (FMV) information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law. 4. \u201cDeemed distribution\u201d treatment Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of \u201cdeemed distributions\u201d treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC\u2019s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the LLC\u2019s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA. It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying \u201cdeemed distribution\u201d treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to IRS Publication 590, it\u2019s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. Read more about the McNulty case and its implications. 5. Prohibited transactions All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. \u201cSelf-dealing\u201d is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself\u2014not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide \u201csweat equity.\u201d It\u2019s not only the IRA owner that can\u2019t participate in any \u201cself-dealing,\u201d but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and penalties are stiff. These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don\u2019t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the IRS list of prohibited transactions here. Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors: Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets Leverage without a non-recourse loan Investing in certain collectible NFTs1 6. Financing Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons: Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases. Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits. IRA-owned active businesses could run into the issue of UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin mining within an IRA. Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA\u2019s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs. What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs? The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls. Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA If you\u2019re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It\u2019s not a \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations. There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it\u2019ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time \u2013 adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope \u2013 ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it\u2019s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the experience of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal\u2019s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0 is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions \u2013 but don\u2019t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network \u2013 we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we do broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork \u2013 presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we\u2019ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can\u2019t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) \u201cLayer Connector\u201d that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs! With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes) A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per \u201clayer\u201d (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.) The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the \u201cDispatcher\u201d. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn\u2019t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can\u2019t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the \u201cparent\u201d. In order for miners to capture the fees from this \u201cchild\u201d transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10\u2019s or 100\u2019s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we\u2019d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would: look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the \u201csplit\u201d transaction here: https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb. The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn\u2019t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas. Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. There are other aspects of the project that we haven\u2019t covered here \u2013 how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one\u2019s easy: it\u2019s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. This is a guest post by Rijndael.

The country has since bet big on Bitcoin, building Bitcoin reserves, mining BTC, and launching educational initiatives. However, the IMF has objected to the Bitcoin law amid loan negotiations with El Salvador, which needs financing to pay debts and obligations. Talks have stalled for nearly two years over the IMF's calls to limit Bitcoin's scope in the country. According to the IMF's communications director Julie Kozack on last Thursday, the \"risks\" of Bitcoin remain a key issue in discussions with El Salvador. The IMF has previously cited financial integrity and stability concerns about Bitcoin. The fund's opposition highlights a clash over the future of money and payments. While Bukele sees Bitcoin as an innovative solution for financial inclusion, the IMF remains wary of its volatility and decentralized nature, and a threat to their dominance. Irrespective of pressures, El Salvador has stood firm on its Bitcoin commitment. The country has invested over $150 million in BTC reserves, continually buying more.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event. What is Bitcoin halving? The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors. Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients Ben Smith, –°–ï–û Immersion BTC 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving. 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I\u2019ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren. 5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that\u2019s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs. Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a \"hodling\" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income? Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment. 5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively. Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving Efficiency is Key: Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem. Strategic Planning: Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols. Adapt and Evaluate: Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards. Collaborative Mining: Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards. Leverage Mining Solutions: Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving. What is the difficulty of mining after halving? The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa. Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include: Mining Altcoins: While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue. Mining Pools and Services: Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects. Hardware Sales and Leasing: Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations. Staking and Masternodes: Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees. Blockchain Development and Consulting: Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting. Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments: Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies. Energy Trading and Grid Services: Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs. Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions: Price Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics. Speculative Activity: Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions. Market Sentiment: Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines. Miner Behavior: The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics. Macro-Economic Factors: External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements. Long-Term Outlook: Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest. While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved. Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition? Efficiency Improvements: One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs. Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing: Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability. Vertical Integration: Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams. Diversification of Revenue Streams: As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments. Hedging Strategies: Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions. Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability. Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions. To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events: November 28, 2012: Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. July 9, 2016: The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. May 20, 2020: The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch \u2014 a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years \u2013 will see Bitcoin\u2019s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. ~94% of the total #bitcoin supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days üëÄ Digital scarcity at its finest üöÄ pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024 Gold Throughout the Ages One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a \u201cfine man\u2019s suit\u201d over time. This principle, known as the \u201cgold-to-decent-suit ratio,\u201d can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga. While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man\u2019s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges. For example, the cost of verification \u2013 or assaying \u2013 gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value. Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous \u201dNixon Shock\u201d in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good. This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. Executive Order 6102 comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited \u201cthe hoarding of gold coin\u201d, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value. Bitcoin\u2019s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven? Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals. As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years \u2013 reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024. Source: Glassnode While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a store of value better than gold, it is certainly promising. This \u201cmagic internet money\u201d continues to rapidly gain on gold\u2019s estimated $15.9 trillion market capitalization. Gold\u2019s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals. Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its informational nature, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute. Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s network of nodes and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s rise as a monetary good \u2013 predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable \u2013 has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold\u2019s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement. While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time. Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s time to shine.","article_summary":"For the first time, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is set to surpass gold after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China. Hong Kong\u2019s new ETF has been in the making for several months now, and it\u2019s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it\u2019s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) already passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it\u2019s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market. Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of big players from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media reported that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city. Considering that there are already signs of diminishing ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis report $90 billion worth of transactions in one year? Source Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves many windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: \u201cIf you get scammed, don\u2019t expect our help or sympathy.\" Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions. It\u2019s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it\u2019s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they\u2019ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have invested heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that\u2019s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. Click the image to learn more. Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong\u2019s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin\u2019s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? As far as Hong Kong\u2019s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local banks shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. The South China Morning Post reported on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new \u201cGlobal\u201d initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to \u201covertake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\" A very tall order. And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the Post that \u201cWe have seen their data and we don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be difficult\u201d. He added that most global competitors are either \u201ceasy to use but not compliant\u201d, or \u201ccompliant but hard to use\u201d, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It\u2019s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to offer nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business\u2019 reigning champs won\u2019t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was reportedly mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city\u2019s own existing firms are confident that they\u2019ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? It\u2019s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It\u2019s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.","article_summary":"With Hong Kong asset managers somewhat reluctant to submit applications for the new ETF, a series of multibillion-dollar firms from Mainland China have entered the market.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","_id":{"date":"Wed Apr 24 21:58:39 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713970719},"creation_date":"2024-04-11T21:00:00Z","categories":["hong kong","bitcoin etf","bitcoin magazine pro","markets"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count. Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. \u201cThe early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for \u2018crypto\u2019 venture\u2019s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,\u201d said Calicott. \u201cWith a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.\u201d In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested. \u201cDue to cyclicality and bitcoin\u2019s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,\u201d Calicott continued. \u201cDespite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.\u201d TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the digital asset\u2019s value plunged to a low of $2,755 before recovering to its current level of $3,178 as of press time. Notably, decentralized exchange Uniswap witnessed a more severe depegging of ezETH, with its value dropping to as low as $700, attributed to liquidity challenges. Renzo is a prominent liquid restaking protocol, with over $3 billion worth of assets locked on its platform, according to DeFillama data. Liquidation galore The DeFi protocol Gearbox confirmed that the depeg led to the liquidation of several Credit Accounts. The protocol\u2019s founder, 0xmikko, provided more insights into the situation, saying: \u201c115 Credit Accounts were liquidated, 10,650 ezETH were sold on Balancer pool. Liquidation losses of 25.77 ETH were automatically covered by internal Gearbox reserve fund, no action needed.\u201d Simultaneously, Cork Protocol, another DeFi platform, explained that the liquidations caused a substantial sell-off of ezETH previously held as collateral. This flood of supply overwhelmed the market, driving the price of ezETH down to 0.2. Interestingly, these liquidations occurred alongside the release of Renzo\u2019s native REZ token, sparking the emergence of Renzo-related phishing scams on social platform X (formerly Twitter). Web3 security firm Scam Sniffer identified two instances where Renzo users cumulatively lost more than $500,000 to a malicious permit signature scam. Amidst this market turmoil, trader czsamsunsb.eth capitalized on the situation, investing 4,099 ETH to acquire 4,221 ezETH. This move proved lucrative, as the trader earned a remarkable profit of 121.65 ETH, per Lookonchain\u2019s findings. What does this mean for LRTs? Crypto analyst Tommy explained that the depegging represents a significant risk across all LRTs, even with withdrawal options enabled. He noted that a depegging event in a decentralized exchange (DEX) pool could occur due to temporary imbalances. Similarly, DeFi researcher Ignas warned of potential exacerbation in LRT depegging, mainly if Eigenlayer, the platform where these tokens operate, introduces two key upgrades of slashing and permissionless AVS. Ignas explained that an AVS malfunction leading to slashing could reduce restaked ETH balances by a hypothetical 5%. While this might seem manageable for direct Eigenlayer stakers, it could trigger substantial disruption to LRT pegs due to liquidity concerns and subsequent panic-driven mass withdrawals. He noted that while prices may stabilize post-slash, the interim period could witness harsh liquidations, and the risk of slashing grows as more AVSes come online. Consequently, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s all FUD right now as slashing won\u2019t derail Eigenlayer but LRTs 1) with low liquidity 2) and are widely accepted as collateral can cause disproportional damage.\u201d The post Renzo\u2019s ezETH token depeg triggers liquidations across DeFi platforms appeared first on CryptoSlate.","article_summary":"Renzo\u2019s liquid restaking token (LRT), ezETH, experienced a significant depegging event that liquidated millions from \u201cloopers\u201d using the token as collateral on leverage protocols like Gearbox.

In response, Zhao\u2019s legal team contends that his incarceration would be unprecedented, citing no prior instances of imprisonment in similar cases. Instead, they proposed an alternative of probation, potentially with home confinement at his residence in Abu Dhabi. Zhao is currently free on bail in the United States, and his sentencing is slated for April 30. Why does the DOJ want 36 months for Zhao? Zhao initially faced a potential 18-month prison term as per his plea deal. However, the DOJ contended in its April 23 filing that the extent of Zhao\u2019s wrongdoing was significant, warranting a harsher penalty. The authorities emphasized that Zhao and Binance deliberately targeted US users as part of their expansion strategy while disregarding local regulations. The prosecutors asserted that Zhao\u2019s actions were intentional, driven by a calculated business decision to flout US laws in pursuit of growth and personal gain. Furthermore, the DOJ highlighted Zhao\u2019s negligence in implementing adequate anti-money laundering measures on the Binance platform, enabling illicit funds to flow unchecked. DOJ argued: \u201c[Zhao] chose not to comply with fundamental U.S. anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements; he chose not to implement and maintain an effective know-your-customer (KYC) system, which prevented effective transaction monitoring and allowed suspicious and criminal users to transact through Binance.\u201d Consequently, the DOJ argued that his sentencing should be used to send a message to the world and deter others from building \u201cfortunes and business empires by breaking US laws.\u201d \u201cA three-year custodial sentence, together with the agreed $50 million fine, would achieve specific and general deterrence,\u201d DOJ concluded.

Unlike simple financial transfers, Runes encapsulate additional information within these transactions. Bitcoin Runes operate by utilizing a method known as \u201ctransaction augmentation,\u201d which allows users to embed arbitrary data into transaction outputs. Runes can store a variety of data types, from simple messages to more complex contract-like scripts. This mechanism is distinctly different from other Bitcoin-based innovations such as Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Ordinals inscribe data into individual satoshis, turning each into a discrete and uniquely identifiable unit of data. It makes Ordinals ideal for representing digital artifacts like images or texts on the Bitcoin blockchain. On the other hand, BRC-20 tokens are a token standard similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20, which is designed for issuing and managing tokens on Bitcoin\u2019s sidechains \u2014 specifically the RSK Smart Contract Network. The Runes protocol operates using a system known as Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). A UTXO represents a specific amount of Bitcoin that hasn\u2019t been spent and can be used to fund new transactions. Runes are assigned to a UTXO via an OP_RETURN function, which allows data to be embedded in transactions without cluttering the network. In a transaction, a Rune is linked to a UTXO through an OP_RETURN output that specifies the output location, a unique numerical ID for the Rune, and the amount of Rune being transacted. This setup also handles Rune characteristics such as divisibility and other metadata, all encoded within the same transaction. The transfer of Runes between parties uses Bitcoin\u2019s secure framework to detail which Runes are moving from one UTXO to another. The strategic launch of Runes on the day of the halving leveraged the attention the event got from the broader market. This timing was chosen to maximize visibility and impact, leveraging the increased attention during halving when miner rewards are reduced, and the future price of Bitcoin is hotly debated. The immediate impact Runes had on the Bitcoin network was huge. Even though the market was expecting high fees and congestion around the halving, the impact Runes had seems to have been unexpected. Although Runes were designed to minimize network clutter by using OP_RETURN outputs, which are provably unspendable and thus do not contribute directly to the growth of the UTXO set, they can still lead to network congestion due to their popularity and the volume of transactions they generate. On April 19, the day before the halving, most transactions on the Bitcoin network were regular financial transactions, accounting for 86.7% of the total transaction share. Ordinals and BRC-20 transactions accounted for 6.5% and 6.9% of the total share, respectively. On April 20, the day of the halving, Runes transactions accounted for 57.7% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network. Financial transactions accounted for a 41.5% share, while Ordinals and BRC-20 took up 0.5% and 0.2% of transactions, respectively. Runes continued to dominate the network throughout the weekend, accounting for 51.6% of the total transactions on April 21. The dominance slightly decreased by April 22, dropping to 42.5%, with Bitcoin financial transactions accounting for 56.5% of the total transactions processed that day.

On April 20, Runes accounted for 57.7% of the transactions paid on the Bitcoin network. The share of fees from financial transactions dropped from 86.6% on April 19 to 38.7% on April 20. However, the share of fees from Runes decreased in the days since the halving, as they accounted for 34.5% of the fees on April 21 and 22.8% on April 22. Graph showing the share of fees on the Bitcoin network by transaction type from Sep. 1, 2023, to April 23, 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) As of April 23, there have been 1.973 million Runes transactions.

Graph showing the daily and cumulative volume for Bitcoin Runes from April 19 to April 23, 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) Despite their bombastic launch, the immediate effects of Runes on the network have somewhat moderated in the days following the halving. The decline in the share of Runes in transactions and fees suggests that while the initial excitement was high, the ongoing integration of Runes into regular transaction patterns might see a more gradual growth. The full consequences Runes will have on the Bitcoin network are yet to be understood. A significant part of the market has been celebrating the introduction of a new form of interaction with the Bitcoin blockchain. While some are focused on the speculative opportunities standards like Runes and Ordinals enable, others seem excited about the innovation and users this could bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, an even larger part of the market has been warning about the increased load on the network caused by Runes, which could lead to higher fees and slower transaction times. The main issue critics seem to have is the dilution of Bitcoin\u2019s purity. An expensive, congested network affects not only Bitcoin\u2019s utility as a means of payment but also as a store of value. Nonetheless, there seems to be a chance the network adjusts to the existence of Runes and absorbs the pressure they create. A relatively similar discourse surrounded Ordinals upon their launch, and almost a year and a half later, the data shows their impact is minimal. While we might see more volatility in terms of fees in the coming weeks and months, it will take longer to see whether Runes become a foundational component of Bitcoin transactions or just a niche market within a larger ecosystem.

The agency detailed its requested fines in an April 19 legal filing. The SEC is primarily seeking $4.2 billion in disgorgement plus $545.7 million in prejudgment interest. The disgorgement aims to have Terraform Labs and Kwon surrender \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d earned from token sales to institutional investors, sales via a Luna Foundation Guard contract with Genesis Asia Pacific, and sales on crypto exchanges between June 2021 and May 2022. The regulator is also seeking civil penalties, including a $420 million fine against Terraform Labs and a $100 million fine against Kwon. The SEC said each civil penalty is a small fraction of the defendants\u2019 ill-gotten gains but acts as punishment and deterrence. Additional restrictions The SEC also requested nonmonetary remedies, including \u201cobey-the-law\u201d injunctions preventing violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, the watchdog intends to impose conduct-based injunctions preventing the defendants from engaging in the purchase, offer, or sale of crypto asset securities, including but not limited to Terra-related tokens such as UST, MIR, LUNA, wLUNA, and LUNA 2.0. It also aims to prevent the defendants from \u201cinducing\u201d others into such transactions. Furthermore, it aims to prevent Terraform Labs from discharging its monetary remedies through bankruptcy. The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. The agency also intends to permanently bar Kwon from serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company and compel him to provide a sworn accounting. Terraform and Kwon respond The defendants responded to the expected remedies in related filings. First, Terraform Labs\u2019 legal team said that the court must impose remedies based only on token sales proven to have occurred in the US. It asserted that most conduct and sales happened outside the US and that court proceedings have not yet addressed this matter. Terraform\u2019s legal team also asserted that the SEC is not entitled to disgorgement because of a lack of pecuniary harm or \u201cout-of-pocket loss.\u201d Kwon and his legal representation also argued a lack of pecuniary harm and denied there is evidence that Kwon received ill-gotten gains separately from Terraform Labs. The relevant filing reads: \u201cThere are no illegal profits for Mr. Kwon to disgorge.\u201d Both parties asserted that maximum civil penalties should be lower than the SEC\u2019s requested amounts. In one estimate, Terraform Labs\u2019 defense suggested a maximum civil penalty of $3.5 million, while Kwon\u2019s defense suggested a civil penalty below $1 million. Both parties also argued that injunctions are unwarranted and suggested that further offenses are unlikely based on current circumstances. The SEC initially filed charges against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon in February 2023. The trial began in March, and the court found both parties liable for fraud in April.

Captain Faibik, a crytocurrency analyst and trader, has emerged with an intriguing prediction, underscoring a narrative that could potentially propel the price of Bitcoin to the coveted $100,000 mark in the upcoming months. Bitcoin Poised For A Notable Rally To $100,000 According to Captain Faibik, Bitcoin has managed to hold the $60,000 support level in the wake of bullish investors in the market. As a result, the largest crypto asset by market cap is currently making a strong comeback. These bullish investors, according to Faibik must reclaim the crucial $72,000 resistance level in order to see a major rally to the $100,000 price level. This scenario acts as a ray of hope for the cryptocurrency community, igniting speculations and influencing projections about Bitcoin\u2019s potential for future growth. Given the anticipated impact of the Bitcoin Halving and bulls, the $72,000 level could be realized in the short term. The expert previously highlighted that the Bitcoin weekly candle closed above the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 10, demonstrating that the bulls are still very much in charge of the market. Following the Descending Channel break out in October last year, BTC Bulls has firmly secured the weekly EMA10, prompting the crypto analyst to put his next price target for the digital asset at $100,000. Faibik also noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin has emerged from a falling wedge pattern. This breakout suggests that a 15% to 20% bullish rally in Bitcoin\u2019s value is on the horizon. Meanwhile, in the daily timeframe, a bullish flag formation is underway, and in the event of an upward breakout from the bullish flag, Faibik anticipates a new all-time high for Bitcoin by May.

Specifics On Rally Of Dogwifhat (WIF) And BONK The price of WIF soared to a 24-hour high of $3.43 on April 24, buoyed by an impressive 96% increase in trading volume. This influx was fueled by notable acquisitions from whales like Ansem, who capitalized on the positive market sentiments. The breakout above the resistance level at $3.18, after a week of sideways trading between $1.97 and $3.18, was a significant trigger. WIF formed a two-week-long ascending triangle, a bullish chart pattern that indicated a continuation of the previous upward trend.

Hayes\u2019 essay serves not only as an investment manifesto but also as a critique of conventional financial wisdom, encouraging investors to maximize their returns by embracing more aggressive tactics. Crypto Bull Run Just Got Started Hayes begins by criticizing the common investor mentality that prevails during bull markets, particularly the tendency to revert to conservative strategies after initial gains. He argues that many investors, despite having made profitable decisions, fail to capitalize fully on bull markets by selling their holdings too soon\u2014particularly when they convert high-performing cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies. \u201cSome of you think you are masters of the universe right now because you bought Solana sub $10 and sold it at $200,\u201d he states, challenging the notion that such actions demonstrate market mastery. Instead, Hayes promotes a strategy of sustained investment and accumulation, particularly in Bitcoin, which he refers to as \u201cthe hardest money ever created.\u201d A central thesis of Hayes\u2019 argument is the critique of fiat currency as a safe haven for profits taken from cryptocurrency investments. \u201cIf you sold shitcoins for fiat that you don\u2019t immediately need for living expenses, you are fucking up,\u201d Hayes bluntly asserts. He discusses the inherent weaknesses of fiat money, primarily its susceptibility to inflation and devaluation through endless cycles of printing by central banks. \u201cFiat will continue to be printed ad infinitum until the system resets,\u201d he predicts, suggesting that fiat currencies are inherently unstable storage of value compared to cryptocurrencies. Hayes extends his analysis to the macroeconomic factors influencing cryptocurrency markets. He describes how major economies like the US, China, the European Union, and Japan are debasing their currencies to manage national debt levels. This macroeconomic maneuvering, according to Hayes, is inadvertently setting the stage for cryptocurrencies to rise. He points out the increasing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, UK, and Hong Kong markets as a tool for institutional and retail investors to hedge against fiat depreciation. This part of his analysis underscores a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class in traditional investment circles, powered by the realization that traditional financial systems are struggling under the weight of unsustainable fiscal policies. Hayes also delves into the strategic aspects of market timing, particularly around events known to influence market dynamics, such as US tax payment deadlines and Bitcoin halving. He notes: As we exit the window of weakness that I forecasted would occur due to April 15th US tax payments and the Bitcoin halving, I want to remind readers why the bull market will continue and prices will get sillier on the upside. This observation suggests that understanding these cyclic events can provide strategic entry and exit points for maximizing investment returns. Emphasizing psychological resilience, Hayes encourages investors to adopt a mindset that resists the conventional impulse to cash out during brief market rallies. \u201cAt this moment, I will resist the urge to take chips off the table.

Grayscale Ethereum Trust Sets Stage For Growth Popular Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the company filed the S-3 registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting to convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot ETH ETF. According to Terrett, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust product is already registered with the SEC, thus, it does not need to file an S-1 form like other ETH ETF issuers or applicants such as Van Eck, Blackrock, Ark Invest, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy. With the recent filing, Grayscale has now submitted all the necessary paperwork for the regulatory watchdog to consider its ETH ETF application and provide a ruling. However, the document has not yet been made accessible to the general public. Terret also reported that the asset firm has filed for an S-1 mini Ethereum ETF under the ticker ETH, similar to that of its Bitcoin mini-me ETF filed under the ticker BTC. In March, the asset manager applied to the SEC for approval to spin out a portion of GBTC shares in order to launch the new mini-me BTC ETF. Specifically, Grayscale came up with the strategy to halt its ever-increasing GBTC outflows since the approval of BTC ETFs in the US. However, the mini-me Bitcoin ETF has yet to receive a green light from the agency. ETF Shares To Be Listed On NYSE Arca It is noteworthy that the company filed the S-3 form with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. The firm made the move after NYSE Arca filed Form 19b-4 for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. With the approval of NYSE Arca\u2019s application on form 19b-4 to list shares and the effectiveness of form S-3 to register the shares, Grayscale plans to list its ETH ETF on NYSE Arca under the ticker ETHE and issue shares continuously. These shares will be made available solely through a prospectus method. Although the shares have been registered with the SEC through a registration statement, they have not yet been deemed operational. Prior to when the registration statement takes effect, neither the shares nor purchase bids may be accepted, and any sale of these shares will be deemed unlawful. By submitting the S-3 registration statement, Grayscale hopes to improve regulatory compliance and lucidity for its ETH Trust. As a result, it will provide prospective investors with more assurance and clarity when negotiating the intricacies of cryptocurrency investments. This move demonstrates Grayscale\u2019s proactive response to the rising demand from institutional and retail investors for Ethereum exposure, enhancing its stand as a leader in the digital asset market.","article_summary":"As optimism around Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continues to dwindle, Grayscale Investments, the world\u2019s leading digital asset manager, has filed an S-3 Registration Statement for its Ethereum Trust, marking a major advancement in its Ether investment services.

The contributor, who is a key figure within the Dogecoin community, used his platform to outline the potential pitfalls that unsuspecting investors might face. The Risks Of Memecoins @Mishaboar expressed deep concerns regarding the current trend in the crypto markets where meme coins quickly achieve market capitalizations in the millions or even billions of dollars, facilitated by almost instantaneous listings on major exchanges. He stated, \u201cThere is an explosion in tokens that go up to crazy market caps, with instant listings (within days) on large exchanges (sometimes in spite of red flags).\u201d This phenomenon, he argued, typically indicates significant backing from venture capitalists (VCs) and crypto exchanges themselves. According to @Mishaboar, the rapid listing of these tokens is often prearranged through partnerships between token creators and crypto exchanges. \u201cThese big players usually hold a large portion of the tokens and may strike deals with exchanges before the tokens launch,\u201d he explained. This arrangement allows them to profit from initial trading surges, while also increasing the nominal liquidity on their platforms at minimal cost. Such practices raise questions about the transparency and fairness of the token launch and listing process. He also highlighted the role of influencers in shaping the market perception of these tokens. \u201cInfluencers tend to create a narrative around these tokens claiming they are \u2018community run\u2019, that they are your \u2018frens\u2019, but this is often really not the case,\u201d @Mishaboar noted. He argued that these narratives are crafted to mask the centralized, profit-driven nature of these token launches, misleading the community about the true character and governance of these tokens. Revisiting past controversies, @Mishaboar brought up unresolved questions about potential insider trading activities of BOME, especially regarding how platforms like Binance quickly list new and risky tokens. \u201cI have a question regarding Binance\u2019s involvement in the launch of certain tokens. Specifically, does Binance have pre-launch agreements with any of the artists or creators of these tokens?\u201d he asked. This question aims to uncover whether there\u2019s a deliberate strategy to manage risks for users or if the rapid listing process inherently increases the risks for them. Expanding on the general risks associated with memecoins, @Mishaboar differentiated between various types of tokens. He emphasized that while some memecoins might have a community aspect, others are \u201c100% VC backed\u201d and are typically those that see instant exchange listings. \u201cNot all tokens are the same,\u201d he declared, urging traders to recognize the high-risk nature of these investments. Dogecoin\u2019s Status And Future Outlook Addressing a user\u2019s concerns about Dogecoin\u2019s projects and asset status, @Mishaboar provided reassurances about the ongoing development and stability of Dogecoin\u2019s network. \u201cDogecoin\u2019s network is chugging along just fine, and 1.14.7 was released a couple of months ago,\u201d he confirmed. He highlighted the continuous efforts of volunteer developers who have significantly reduced technical debt since 2021, improving the overall health of the network. He added, \u201cWe will have new releases of Dogecoin Core (the reference implementation) and there are companies and organizations and indie devs building stuff for it. As for companies (e.g. like X or Tesla) integrating it into their platforms, this is really up to these companies and the laws they must comply to. Technically there is nothing missing in Dogecoin that would prevent them from adopting it.\u201d In concluding his extensive remarks, @Mishaboar reiterated the importance of vigilance and informed decision-making in the cryptocurrency market. He reminded his audience that despite the allure of quick profits, the volatile nature of memecoins means that trading them is akin to gambling, with risks varying significantly across different tokens and market caps. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.1615.","article_summary":"In a nuanced critique published on X, a prominent Dogecoin contributor known as @Mishaboar has issued a significant warning concerning the trading of meme coins, especially those that secure listings on cryptocurrency exchanges almost immediately after their release.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) examines how individuals in these nations are leveraging Bitcoin to manage their finances, bypassing capital controls through off-blockchain transactions. This trend underscores the resilience and adaptability of cryptocurrencies in providing financial autonomy to individuals in challenging economic environments. The IMF has released a groundbreaking report titled \u201cA Primer on Bitcoin Cross-Border Flows,\u201d shedding light on the increasing relevance of the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency in facilitating international financial exchanges. Understanding The Dynamics Of Bitcoin Transactions The report also uncovers a fascinating correlation between Bitcoin flows and traditional economic markers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, cryptocurrency-specific factors such as market volatility and user sentiment exert a stronger influence on crypto transactions than traditional indicators. This suggests that cryptocurrencies, with their unique adoption dynamics, possess the potential to serve as a hedge against conventional financial risks, offering individuals and businesses a novel avenue for diversification and risk management. Navigating Regulatory Challenges In The Crypto Landscape While recognizing the promising role of Bitcoin in fostering cross-border commerce and financial inclusion, the IMF report sounds a note of caution regarding regulatory oversight. The inherent anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions raises concerns about their potential misuse for illicit activities such as money laundering. Consequently, the report underscores the imperative for global cooperation in establishing clear and consistent regulations to mitigate risks and foster a secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions. The call for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation echoes across borders, as policymakers grapple with the complexities of overseeing a rapidly evolving financial ecosystem. Clear and transparent regulations not only address the risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but also lay the groundwork for a more predictable and stable financial environment. By striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding against potential abuses, regulators can pave the way for continued growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency industry. Embracing The Potential Of Bitcoin As Bitcoin\u2019s influence on global finance continues to expand, the IMF report serves as a timely reminder of the opportunities and challenges associated with cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin holds immense promise in facilitating cross-border transactions and promoting financial inclusion, effective regulation is essential to mitigate risks and ensure the integrity of the financial system. By embracing the potential of Bitcoin while proactively addressing regulatory challenges, policymakers can harness the transformative power of cryptocurrencies to shape a more inclusive and resilient global economy.

This follows his guilty plea last year to charges concerning severe lapses in the company\u2019s anti-money laundering (AML) controls, as mandated by the US Bank Secrecy Act. A \u201cMessage\u201d To The Binance Founder And The World Zhao\u2019s explicit disregard for US regulations was underscored by the DOJ in a scathing sentencing memorandum. They quoted Zhao\u2019s own words, highlighting his approach to legal compliance: \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d suggesting a strategic bypass of regulatory requirements to expedite Binance\u2019s market expansion and profitability. The DOJ laid out the case against Zhao, describing how his decisions to flout US laws were integral to Binance\u2019s business strategy, which aggressively targeted US customers without adhering to requisite legal standards. \u201cZhao\u2019s willful violation of US law was no accident or oversight. He made a business decision that violating US law was the best way to attract users, build his company, and line his pockets,\u201d the US Attorney\u2019s Office stated. According to the DOJ, Zhao\u2019s actions enabled Binance to operate a \u2018Wild West\u2019 model of cryptocurrency exchange, inviting illicit financial flows. The memorandum notes, \u201cAs a result, Zhao is one of richest people in the world and a celebrity in the crypto industry. Zhao bet that he would not get caught, and that if he did, the consequences would not be as serious as the crime.\u201d The prosecution detailed how Zhao\u2019s failure to implement an effective AML program led Binance to process hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transactions violating US sanctions against Iran and other countries, quantifying the total at approximately $898 million. The sentencing memorandum emphasizes the gravity and scale of these violations, stating, \u201cZhao knew that his decision not to implement an effective AML program would result in Binance facilitating transactions between US users and users in Iran and other sanctioned countries and regions in violation of US law.\u201d In light of these findings, the DOJ is recommending a sentence that would go beyond the federal guidelines, suggesting a 36-month term of imprisonment to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for law, afford adequate deterrence, and serve as just punishment for Zhao\u2019s criminal acts.\u201d Zhao\u2019s sentencing is poised to set a precedent in the regulatory oversight of the crypto industry, particularly concerning compliance with US financial laws. The outcome will likely resonate across the crypto landscape, potentially reshaping how exchanges operate in compliance with US regulations. The DOJ\u2019s closing remarks in the memorandum drive home the broader implications of Zhao\u2019s sentencing: \u201cThe sentence in this case will not just send a message to Zhao but also to the world.\u201d The final sentencing decision, expected to be delivered on April 30, marks a crucial juncture for the legal scrutiny of crypto operations within the United States.

By accepting donations in crypto such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets, non-profits are witnessing a surge in contributions, streamlining processes, and reaching new donor demographics. This year alone, the two largest US charities have reportedly raised over $2 billion through crypto donations, according to a recent report by Bankless Times. This represents a massive leap from the $125 million collected in donations throughout 2022. The Giving Block, a platform facilitating digital currency donations for charities, has been instrumental in this shift. Crypto Donations: A Boon For Efficiency And Convenience The rise of crypto donations offers several advantages for both charities and donors. Platforms like The Giving Block simplify transactions, allowing donors to bypass complex international money transfers. This expedites the process and ensures donations reach their intended causes faster. Additionally, this type of donations often appeal to a younger, tech-savvy generation comfortable with digital transactions. For charities, accepting crypto donations translates to a wider funding pool. It allows them to tap into a global network of investors who may not have traditionally participated in philanthropy. This diversification can be crucial for organizations seeking to expand their reach and impact. Regulatory And Security Challenges While the influx of crypto donations presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with challenges. Charities must navigate a complex regulatory landscape to ensure compliance with Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. These regulations are essential for preventing fraud and maintaining the integrity of the financial system. However, navigating KYC/AML compliance can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process for nonprofits. Furthermore, the digital nature of cryptocurrency exposes charities to cybersecurity risks. Hackers may target these organizations to steal donated funds. To mitigate these risks, charities need to invest in robust cybersecurity measures and stay updated on the latest threats. The Future Of Philanthropy: A Promising Outlook Despite these challenges, the trend of crypto donations in the nonprofit sector shows no signs of slowing down. With the increasing adoption of Bitcoin and growing public confidence in digital transactions, charities are likely to see a continued rise in digital currency contributions. As the regulatory environment evolves and security protocols strengthen, crypto donations hold the potential to revolutionize philanthropic giving, fostering a more efficient, transparent, and globally connected giving ecosystem.

Unlike their seasoned counterparts who boast over 200% in unrealized profits, these newcomers are experiencing a much more modest 1.5% gain. This suggests they might have entered the crypto market at a higher price point, potentially during the recent surge towards the $67,000 resistance level. Miners Making Hay Despite the contrasting fortunes of New and Long-Term Whales, the overall market sentiment seems bullish. CryptoQuant\u2019s analysis extends beyond whales, revealing healthy profits for miners as well. Small miners are leading the pack with an impressive 130% in unrealized profits, while their larger counterparts haven\u2019t done too shabby either, sitting at a comfortable 81%. This robust mining profitability indicates a healthy network, with miners diligently securing the Bitcoin blockchain. Bullish Outlook Ju believes this data combination points towards a prolonged bull run. The fact that New Whales haven\u2019t cashed out for significant profits suggests they\u2019re in it for the long haul, potentially anticipating further price increases. This aligns with the ongoing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, with Fidelity\u2019s IBIT leading the pack in terms of new investments last week. The $67,000 Question However, the path forward isn\u2019t entirely smooth sailing. Bitcoin is currently struggling to decisively break through the $67,000 resistance level. This could be a point of contention in the near future, with bulls pushing for a breakout and bears looking for a potential correction. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a fascinating dynamic. New investors with deep pockets are entering, established whales are holding firm, and miners are profiting handsomely. While the short-term price movement of Bitcoin remains to be seen, the overall market sentiment seems to favor a continuation of the bull run.

The filing clarified that its US-based ODL services have shifted from using XRP to Tether (USDT) as a bridge currency. Why Ripple Chose USDT This strategic pivot was a response to the summary judgment in the SEC lawsuit which found that institutional sales fell under the US security laws. Since the ruling, non-US entities have been the sole contracting parties for XRP sales contracts to ODL customers. The filing highlights that \u201cthe company\u2019s remaining ODL business in the United States uses a non-XRP bridge currency.\u201d Monica Long, President of Ripple, elaborated in an internal email, details of which were shared by prominent XRP community member Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) on social media platform X. Long stated: Immediately following the Order, we took steps to migrate each US-based ODL customer from using XRP as the bridge currency in ODL to using USDT (or the contract was terminated). We should continue to use USDT (or BTC or other vetted stablecoins) for US based flows unless otherwise approved by Legal. This adjustment reflects the company\u2019s effort to ensure its service offerings align with US legal standards while still supporting global operations largely unaffected by the SEC\u2019s scrutiny. The email emphasizes the strategic role of the Singapore subsidiaries, which now handle most contractual relationships for selling XRP to new ODL customers, particularly those outside the US Long notes: Ripple\u2019s Singapore subsidiaries have been the primary contracting entity for Commitment to Sell XRP contracts to new ODL customers, who are predominantly foreign. And since the Order, non-US entities have exclusively been the contracting parties for XRP sales contracts to ODL customers. The restructuring within Ripple\u2019s business model underscores a significant geographical and operational pivot.

According to the paper, the collaboration \u201cpresents an opportunity to accelerate the clean energy transition\u201d using crypto-economic incentives. PayPal Research On Bitcoin Mining In a recently published paper, PayPal\u2019s Blockchain Research Group (BRG) proposed \u201cthe possibility for a more sustainable future\u201d in Bitcoin mining. The investigation revealed that, as of April 2, data estimates the annualized emissions to be over 85 million metric tons of carbon dioxide due to Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism: The reason behind this significant impact is the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that secures the Bitcoin network. In PoW, miners engage in a competitive race to find solutions (i.e., cryptographic hashes) for Bitcoin blocks, requiring powerful computational hardware like ASIC machines. This race and its demand for robust computational power require significant electricity. Miners\u2019 use of carbon-based energy sources consequentially \u201cresults in the underlying greenhouse gas emissions footprint of the Bitcoin network.\u201d As a solution, PayPal\u2019s BRG aims to \u201cincentivize desired activity with crypto-economics\u201d to improve and optimize \u201cexisting, proven strong networks.\u201d Additionally, the firm wishes to support \u201cmore environmentally responsible\u201d mining and encourage other miners to shift towards cleaner energy sources.\u201d Bitcoin Rewards For \u201cGreen Mining\u201d The paper suggests routing on-chain transactions to \u201cgreen miners\u201d via low transaction fees with a BTC reward \u201clocked\u201d in a multisig payout address. The rewards would serve as an incentive to mine these transactions, as only green miners would be eligible to receive them. The solution is based on identifying miners that use low-emissions energy sources. After identification, their public keys, referred to as \u201cgreen keys,\u201d would be used to reward miners with Bitcoin in a trust-independent method through a \u201c1-of-n multisig script.\u201d As a result, the payout address would allow the miners with green keys to claim the rewards. Providers such as Energy Web would help to identify the green miners and onboard them to the solution. The non-profit organization offers a \u201cGreen Proofs for Bitcoin\u201d initiative that promotes transparency and \u201csupports alignment between Bitcoin mining and global decarbonization effort.\u201d Miners would apply for and share their sustainable mining certifications through the Green Proofs for Bitcoin validation platform. Moreover, the proposed solution has been successfully tested with DMG. The firm broadcasted multiple low-fee transactions to test how effectively they would operate under different levels of on-chain transaction volumes. Depending on the transaction volume, the low-fee ones would \u201ceither take a long time to confirm or eventually be dropped by the network.\u201d This would increase the green miners\u2019 chances to pick them up. Per the paper, the trade-offs were \u201cacceptable,\u201d however, alternative solutions could be evaluated: It is possible to design alternative solutions where transactions and rewards can be sent to miners via a private mechanism rather than using the public mempool. Exploring technologies like smart contracts or the lighting network is also proposed as an alternative way to address the issues. However, they could come at the expense of \u201ctrust dependence and a more complex implementation.\u201d However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin mining has been controversial. While many legacy companies, such as PayPal and others, have targeted the network due to its alleged intense electrical consumption and carbon emissions, other research has pointed to the increasing use of renewable energy and the low carbon emissions the nascent industry produces, as seen in the chart below.

It\u2019s not possible, you might be thinking, and we say that it\u2019s possible, and even more, the game is up and running! Moreover, as you enroll and become the Metaverse catcher, you can contribute to the game\u2019s development. SpaceCatch is the comprehensive blockchain and Web3 game that uses the latest and most advanced technologies to offer you a unique adventure with a paramount mission while joining a vibrant and extensive community. Reasons 1. The Ultimate Fight and an Unforgettable Tale As the Earth is in danger of greedy aliens aiming to take the planet by storm, Metaverse catchers must be the heroes of this story and save us all from this invasion. Users must be creative, young catcher, as these aliens are sneaky, and some missions are enigmatic, but cooperation is vital in this mysterious world. So, be sure to step up your game, build a hero, and defeat them all! 2. Advanced Technologies for All Catchers There\u2019s no need to be scared, as SpaceCatch equips its catchers with some of advanced technologies to ensure a fair battle, especially when the aliens are AI-powered. So, besides having the most thrilling experience of your life, you also level up and reach new ground. Let\u2019s see what tech SpaceCatch embodies. First, SpaceCatch uses Move-to-Earn and Play-to-Earn mechanics to get you moving out of your couch. Moreover, the entire gameplay and progress are fueled by NFT boosters, which can be acquired by doing free physical activity or purchasing them from other players. As you can see, you can either gather them for you and make a profit or buy them directly from other catchers. Once you get outside, the Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies combine to seamlessly blend exterior reality with gameplay directly on your iOS or Android phone. As a side note, SpaceCatch caters to both outdoor and indoor, as it features small indoor mini-games and training areas. Yet, it\u2019s best to take your battles outside for big commissions. 3. Sustainable Tokenomics Often, we saw other crypto, blockchain, or Web3 games that focus solely on rewarding their players, like that is the only aspect a player is looking for. Indeed, gratification could be the cherry on top, but it\u2019s worth nothing if the game is unsustainable, which makes the value of that reward equal to nothing. Therefore, SpaceCatch flips this narrative and caters to deflationary tokenomics, whereby the in-game rewards also have real-world value. Besides this, remember that you can trade or sell the item, so there\u2019s no need to have double items, which are useless. 4. True Ownership Makes SpaceCatch Go Round! Since the game integrates Web3 and blockchain features, all players can leverage them to trade, rent, and borrow items from one another, which adds to better ecosystem sustainability and true ownership. 5. Player Driven Economy As settled, SpaceCatch was created to offer all its catchers more than an immersive game, yet players\u2019 gameplay drives its economy. Therefore, player autonomy and diverse monetization opportunities create an open in-game economy that keeps you all engaged and leads to a thriving community. Become the Earth Saviour As the Public Beta is already launched, you still have time to enroll through the official website while competing against sneaky aliens with a vibrant and eager-to-win community through Telegram, Discord, X (Twitter), YouTube, Instagram, Medium, CoinMarketCap, or CoinGecko.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, these measures aim to disconnect these banks from the global financial system. The primary concern is their involvement in facilitating trade that bolsters Russia\u2019s military capabilities against Ukraine. Will China Resort to Crypto if the US Imposes Sanctions? Although China claims that it has not provided weapons to Russia since the Ukraine invasion began, the US argues that the export of dual-use items like chips and machinery has critically strengthened Russia\u2019s military. These proposed sanctions are seen as an \u201cescalatory option\u201d to be employed if diplomatic efforts fall short. Historically, countries isolated from the global financial network have turned to cryptocurrencies as a workaround. For example, Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company, PDVSA, has shifted to using Tether (USDT) to evade renewed US sanctions. This move aims to protect its oil revenues from international banking constraints. Read more: 9 Best Crypto Wallets to Store Tether (USDT) Similarly, Russia has leveraged cryptocurrencies to sidestep Western sanctions. Russian firms are reportedly using Tether\u2019s USDT to acquire vital components for military hardware. This strategy facilitates transactions that conventional financial systems less easily trace. The increasing use of cryptocurrency in these contexts highlights its usage by countries to bypass economic sanctions. Given these developments, growing speculation exists about China\u2019s potential response to being similarly isolated. Traditionally, China has been strict in regulating cryptocurrencies, driven by concerns over financial instability and unauthorized capital outflows. \u201cStudy the reallocation of Chinese capital from stocks and real estate to gold.

Nigeria\u2019s CBN to Arrest USDT Traders in Economic Probe The mandate instructs Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), and Other Financial Institutions (OFIs) to flag and restrict accounts suspected of engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. The CBN\u2019s directive particularly demands implementing a post-no-debit (PND) order for six months on relevant accounts. Additionally, warning of heavy sanctions for non-compliance. Furthermore, the CBN clarified its stance on illicit activities amid these developments. It stated that any individual or \u201csuspected agent\u201d clandestinely trading or facilitating the sale of USDT would face arrest.

Nathaniel Luz, CEO of Flincap, remarked on the omission of indigenous crypto exchanges. He attributes it to their proactive efforts in obtaining necessary operational licenses. \u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy that the recent circular did not mention any indigenous crypto exchanges, likely because many Nigerian crypto companies, such as Flincap, have been actively pursuing the required licenses,\u201d said Nathaniel Luz, CEO of Flincap.

So.Social\u2019s recently released new set of social protocols are not just another social network like Friend.Tech or Farcaster, but an innovative blend of decentralized social networks, assets, and cutting-edge AI technologies. Let us explore the project\u2019s backstory, core features, and groundbreaking technologies in more detail. The \u201cSAAG\u201d Model So.Social stands as the pioneering protocol merging SocialFi, AI, Assets, and GameFi into a single entity, leading users towards social interaction 3.0: Full Self-Sovereignty. The integration of tokenomics and social networks incentivizes community members, captivates users\u2019 attention through gaming, and allows AI technologies to serve as a realistic community tool. So.Social Aims to Address Several Key Issues User Privacy: Users often worry about the privacy of their data, especially in regards to how platforms use their personal information for advertising and data sales. Government regulations tend to support user concerns over platform revenue. Unfair Revenue Distribution: Users feel that platforms do not fairly distribute the value they create through their social interactions. Larger platforms might take a significant portion of earned income, leaving creators with less. Content Censorship: Users want free speech but face strict content moderation policies from the platforms they use. These policies can stifle discussions and limit free expression. Lack of Trust in Governance: Users must inherently trust social platforms for financial transactions without any guarantee of transparency. For instance, when making charitable donations, users must trust the platform and recipient without further verification options. What Makes So.Social Unique Social Infrastructure Layer: Changing the way social platforms are structured, So.Social introduces a new social infrastructure layer. This layer can be viewed as a foundational structure that gives platforms more flexibility and lets users control how they interact socially. Social Consensus Mechanisms: Groups, communities, or societies have different ways of making collective decisions, including through voting, discussions, or negotiations. Strong social consensus mechanisms are important in ensuring that decisions represent the opinions of the majority while considering the views of everyone involved and are key to healthy community governance. Sovereign DAO: So.Social\u2019s protocols empower users to achieve genuine community governance by offering a practical approach to community management. So.Social adopters can define rules and contracts for their social interactions, enhancing transparency and trust within the community. Stakeholder Governance: In So.Social\u2019s ecosystem, all members become stakeholders, bridging the gap between regular users and investors. Every member has the opportunity to earn based on their contributions to the community. This tokenized system encourages active participation in social activities and fosters deeper community engagement and the creation of valuable content. Community Growth Mechanisms: Through the introduction of a \u201cGroupUp\u201d model, users are encouraged to invite new members or connect with other users to unlock additional rights and revenue opportunities. This leads to organic growth and strengthens user engagement and consensus within the community. Additionally, So.Social innovatively leverages AI technologies to ensure fair and scientific asset distribution. By depersonalizing this process, a platform may guarantee fairness and transparency in revenue distribution and decision making. This groundbreaking approach transforms the online social landscape, offering a glimpse into the tokenized future of social networks driven by Web3 technology. \u201cSo.Social is at the forefront of a new paradigm of social interactions, and our social protocols empower users to shape each interaction to their wishes, ensuring transparency, fairness, and trust. Importantly, it grants every community member cultural and financial sovereignty. We envision a future that addresses the social needs of all users,\u201d explained Ian, So.Social Co-founder.

Can Injective (INJ) Surge 45%? INJ is the native token of a Cosmos-based Layer 1 blockchain, managed by the non-profit Injective Foundation. The recent endorsement of the INJ 3.0 proposal, unveiled on April 19, is built on two main adjustments. Firstly, it revises INJ\u2019s inflationary bounds by setting the lower and upper limits at 4% and 7%, respectively. These limits will be incrementally enforced and reassessed in the second quarter of 2026.

In addition, the sentencing memo filed on Tuesday recommends a substantial $50 million fine. Prosecutors in the case have pointed out the broad impact of Zhao\u2019s actions on the financial system\u2019s integrity, calling for a stricter sentence. They intend to punish Zhao and deter similar future conduct by others in the industry. \u201cGiven the magnitude of Zhao\u2019s willful violation of US law and its consequences, an above-guidelines sentence of 36 months is warranted,\u201d US prosecutors said.

The silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold is currently moving within a bearish pattern, and instead of being the rescuer, the investors might end up triggering the decline.

Almost all layer-one (L1) and layer-two (L2) chains are using flashy meme coins to attract more on-chain activities. Moreover, the initial rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) has inspired a new generation of meme coins including frog-themed, and cat-themed, among many others. The meme coin industry is expected to continue playing a crucial role in the ongoing crypto bull run. Nonetheless, investors should be extra vigilant while dealing with new and flashy meme coins to avoid holding coins without liquidity and have high potential risks of rug pulls. Top Meme Coin to Lead Bullish Recovery Bitcoin dominance has been eating into the altcoin market cap for the past year fueled by the heightened demand from institutional investors. However, most analysts believe an altseason will kickstart soon as BTC holders continue to distribute their profits to different altcoins. Meanwhile, traders should keep a close watch on the ETH/BTC pair, which is the ultimate indicator of the onset of the anticipated altseason. Floki (FLOKI) Floki is a fast-growing meme coin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $2 billion, backed by a thriving community. According to the latest market data, the Floki price edged over 15 percent higher in the past 24 hours to trade around $0.002 on Wednesday during the mid-London session. According to a popular crypto analyst alias Captain Faibik, Floki\u2019s price is en route to retesting its all-time high (ATH) following a breakout of a daily bullish flag. Notably, the crypto analyst expects the Floki price to rally as much as 3X from current levels in the coming days. $FLOKI has also Broke out of Bullish Flag on the Daily timeframe Chart. ‚úÖ Looks Promising for 2-3x Bullish Rally in the Coming Days. üìà#Crypto #FLOKI #FLOKIUSDT pic.twitter.com/Q2Jsr3h027 \u2014 Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 24, 2024 The Floki ecosystem is fast transforming into a vibrant web3 ecosystem, especially through its FlokiFi Locker system.

According to the Renzo Protocol, the Season 1 ezPoints campaign will end on April 26. The protocol confirms that it has experienced immense growth in the volume of active users and the Total Value Locked (TVL). The growth in its TVL has placed Renzo amongst the top 10 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Renzo Season 2 Starts on April 26 Notably, Season 2 will kick off almost immediately as the current season ends on Friday, April 26. The decentralization process will follow on April 30 and this will be marked by the launch of REZ, the native token of the Renzo Protocol. Users cannot claim their REZ until May 2 when 5% of the total REZ supply will be distributed, representing 500 million units. The distribution would be done based on each user\u2019s accumulated ezPoints. Notably, 2% of the earmarked 5% airdrop will go to Milady Maker and SchizoPosters communities respectively. While the total supply of the REZ token is 10 billion, the initial circulating supply is pegged at 1.05 billion. The largest percentage of the token distribution will be allocated to investors and the smallest (2.5%) to Launchpool like Binance which recently announced the restaking protocol as its 53rd project. Most of the largest wallets will be subjected to a 50% unlock at TGE and another 50% linear, vesting over six months. Renzo Protocol plans to relocate unclaimed or unvested tokens to loyal users who maintain their relationship with the platform. Eligible wallets from Season 1 will get additional boost for the next phase but this is based on a condition. \u201c\u2026..as long as your ezETH balance from Season 1 remains in your wallet or in any of the Renzo DeFi integrations,\u201d the protocol noted. The REZ token can be used for several activities including for voting on governance proposals, precisely for matters involving the Renzo Protocol. Renzo Season 1 Comes to an End Some of the highlights from Season 1 are a deposit of $3.5 billion, restaking market share of 33.5%, and over 250,000 users. For a liquid staking protocol that launched barely four months ago, Renzo has hit several significant milestones. In this short time, the protocol was able to unlock native restaking on seven networks including Ethereum, Coinbase\u2019s Base, Arbitrum, Mode, Blast, BNB Smart Chain, and Linea. Renzo also recorded ezETH on Layer-2 accounts for 24% of the total Renzo TVL. Per a published statement, Renzo stated that it is the first restaking protocol to bring both native ETH and LST deposits, with stETH and wBETH making up about $110 million of the TVL in a matter of two weeks of its launch.

Australia\u2019s latest figure means that the country now hosts 2.7% of the global Bitcoin ATM network. Meanwhile, the data from Coin ATM Radar suggests that the US hosted its first 1,000 crypto ATMs in November 2017. Canada also hit the milestone in January 2021. However, the US has now added many more, and is now home to 31,170 machines, an impressive 82.8% of the global Bitcoin ATMs. Canada on the other hand currently controls 2,918 crypto ATMs, accounting for 7.8% of the global lot. Growing Adoption of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia Interestingly, the Bitcoin ATM market was relatively inactive in Australia until the end of 2022. However, as private firms began to enter into the market, it blossomed exponentially. The timing of this surge is noteworthy, with Australia\u2019s ascent coinciding with a global wave of interest in cryptocurrencies. By April 2023, the country had already overtaken Asia on the Bitcoin ATM count roll. That means it had a count greater than China, Japan, Singapore and India combined. With its current installation momentum, Australia is poised to surpass even Europe any time soon. Europe currently boasts a network of 1,617 Bitcoin ATMs, representing 4.3% of the global size. Member countries in Europe that have significant numbers of crypto ATMs include Spain with 261, El Salvador (215), Poland (211), and Germany (194). Australia\u2019s journey towards crypto dominance is not without challenges. Regulatory scrutiny, security concerns, and market volatility stand as potential roadblocks. However, the nation\u2019s unwavering commitment to innovation and its embrace of emerging technologies speak well for a promising future in the crypto sphere. As Australia celebrates this milestone, it sends a clear message to the world about its intent to be at the forefront of global crypto adoption.

Martha","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker Hong Kong Set to Launch Approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Next Week Hong Kong is on the brink of introducing its crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for trading. According to a recent Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter, the country\u2019s spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (Ether) ETFs will debut on exchanges early next week. The new developments follow Hong Kong\u2019s approval of several crypto ETF applications on April 15, 2024. Chinese financial services companies such as China Asset Management and Bosera Capital, through their Hong Kong subsidiaries, obtained approval from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to offer their customers new investment products. Hong Kong to Begin Trading ETFs by April Ending Bloomberg said that these companies are already in the final stages of preparation to commence trading for the crypto investment vehicles by the end of April. Investors in the Asian market will soon have access to both BTC and Ether through these ETFs, allowing them to invest in the two leading cryptocurrencies without directly engaging with the digital asset market. The ETF boom began in January when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 applications submitted by asset managers like BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, Fidelity Investments, ARK 21 Shares, and Invesco Galaxy. With the US leading the way, Hong Kong has joined the trend, paving the way for investors in the Asian region to explore the crypto economy. However, unlike Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which are structured for cash redemption, Hong Kong\u2019s crypto ETFs will utilize an in-kind subscription and redemption model. This approach allows for the direct exchange of underlying assets for ETF units and vice versa. Potential Inflows vs Expectations Bloomberg\u2019s report suggested that the launch of the ETFs next week in Hong Kong will likely draw comparisons with the three-month-old US Bitcoin funds, which have already made a significant impact on Wall Street. The US ETFs have already accumulated a total of $56 billion in assets, and the crypto community anticipates that Hong Kong\u2019s ETFs will achieve similar success if mainland Chinese investors are allowed to participate in the market. Last week, Coinspeaker reported that Alessio Quaglini, the CEO of Hex Trust, a crypto custodian firm, said there is a chance Chinese investors might have access to Hong Kong\u2019s crypto ETFs due to unclear regulations regarding these funds in the country. Analysts speculate that if Chinese investors are able to participate, the ETFs could attract a massive inflow of around $25 billion. However, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF expert, Eric Balchunas, believes that Hong Kong might realistically see inflows of up to $500 million, considering the SFC has yet to approve ETFs from major asset management giants like BlackRock. Bloomberg also noted that the amount of funds generated from these crypto ETFs will indicate Hong Kong\u2019s progress toward becoming a leading financial hub for cryptocurrencies. The country, along with Dubai, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, is competing to become a hub for modern financial innovations. next Hong Kong Set to Launch Approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Next Week","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Hong Kong Set to Launch Approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Next Week The launch of the ETFs next week in Hong Kong will likely draw comparisons with the three-month-old US Bitcoin funds, which have already made a significant impact on Wall Street.

Worldcoin said that it plans to implement this through the private sale to non-US institutions. In its blog post on Tuesday, April 23, Worldcoin stated that the Worldcoin foundation subsidiary World Assets, which is in charge of the WLD assets, will sell nearly 1.5 million Worldcoins (WLD) worth a staggering $8.5 million every week via a series of \u201cprivate placements to a select group of institutional trading firms\u201d outside the United States. \u201cWorld Assets expects to sell between 0.5 million and 1.5 million WLD per week on average. The circulating supply of WLD will thus increase correspondingly,\u201d noted Worldcoin in its blog post. Pumping a staggering 1.5 million WLD tokens every week for six months straight would lead to an increase of 36 million WLD token supply, amounting to ~$200 million as per the current supply. Worldcoin currently has a supply of 193 million WLD tokens in the market. This shows that it is planning to add nearly 19% of the additional supply to the market. As soon as the news of Worldcoin increasing the WLD supply spread, the price of the WLD token came under some selling pressure. As of press time, Worldcoin (WLD) is trading 3.5% down at a price of $5.45 and a market cap of over $1.058 billion. Worldcoin stated its intention to engage in negotiations with individual trading firms, particularly those in competition with one another, to conduct private placements at or near prevailing Worldcoin (WLD) market prices. This strategy aims to mitigate the potential price impact on the token. About the Worldcoin (WLD) Project Worldcoin is the pet project of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman current Wolrdcoin CEO Alex Blania, and Max Novendstern, launched last year in July 2023, in beta. This crypto-based digital identity project markets itself as providing a solution to identity issues evolving through rapid developments in AI along with a push for a new model of universal basic income through its native WLD token. Users of Worldcoin register their identity through the company\u2019s \u201cWorld App\u201d by scanning their retinas at machines called \u201cOrbs,\u201d as designated by the company.

According to the filing, Ripple now uses Tether\u2019s USDT instead of XRP as the bridge currency for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services for US clients. Ripple Uses USDT for ODL in the US Ripple\u2019s decision to switch to USDT stems from last year\u2019s court ruling, which concluded that the institutional sale of XRP tokens violates security laws in the US. Following the verdict, Ripple decided to use non-US entities as contract parties to handle the sale of XRP to ODL customers. The filing also notes that all ODL clients in the US now use \u201ca non-XRP bridge currency\u201d. In addition to the filing, a popular XRP proponent Crypto Eri posted an update on X. Crypto Eri\u2019s post contains a screenshot of an alleged internal note from Ripple President Monica Long detailing the company\u2019s move to XRP from USDT. According to Long: \u201cImmediately following the Order, we took steps to migrate each US-based ODL customer from using XRP as the bridge currency in ODL to using USDT (or the contract was terminated.) We should continue to use USDT (or BTC or other vetted stablecoins) for US based flows unless otherwise approved by Legal.\u201d Making this change indicates Ripple\u2019s willingness to continue providing its ODL services to customers in the US, while adhering to legal restrictions. Long\u2019s message specified the non-US entities used for ODL are Singaporean. The Ripple president noted that these entities are the primary contracting entities used to sell XRP contracts to new ODL customers \u201cwho are predominantly foreign.\u201d Long also included an XRP minimum requirement enforced in 2023. According to Crypto Eri\u2019s image, Ripple required all ODL customers or their corporate owners to have at least $5 million in assets, except for \u201cotherwise sophisticated entities.\u201d She added that Legal gets to determine whether or not an entity qualifies as \u201csophisticated.\u201d The rule is likely to ensure that ODL clients have robust reserves to continuously cater to their business needs and protect the end customers. XRP Sales May Affect Ripple\u2019s Revenue Ripple\u2019s filing contains indications that XRP sales are integral to the company\u2019s financials. The document shows that according to Ripple\u2019s accounting expert, Anthony Bracco, Ripple\u2019s books show that without accounting for revenue from the sale of XRP, the company operated a loss from April 1, 2014, through December 22, 2020. Ripple recently filed a motion against the SEC, disputing the agency\u2019s request for a $2 billion fine against the company. According to Ripple, the fine should be $10 million at most. In the filing, Ripple notes that it is willing to adhere to guidance in the future.

He explained how sovereign debt, currency debasement, and the growing attraction towards cryptocurrencies as a protection against the decline in fiat currency all interact with each other. Hayes acknowledg—É–≤ that while certain traders may take pride in their recent successes, such as capitalizing on Solana\u2019s rapid surge, the real crypto legends are those who adopted the \u201cLeft Curve\u201d mindset during the bear market spanning from 2021 to 2023. This approach involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, as the bull market gathers strength Currency Debasement and Institutional Investment: Catalysts for Crypto Surge Hayes further delved into the fact that major economic powerhouses such as the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan are deliberately lowering the value of their currencies to handle their government debts. He also noted that traditional financial institutions (TradFi) are now able to profit from this situation through Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). As a result, these institutions are urging their clients to safeguard the value of their wealth against currency devaluation. This increase in institutional investment further boosts the cryptocurrency surge, confirming the belief that crypto is a practical way to protect against the depreciation of fiat currency. Understanding Nominal GDP and Its Impact on Economic Policies Hayes explains the concept of nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which includes inflation and real growth. He argues that governments borrow money to fund projects, hoping to boost economic growth and attract investors with promising yields. However, politicians often manipulate the system by keeping government bond yields lower than GDP growth rates. This allows them to spend more without raising taxes, but it leads to bad investments and economic stagnation. As a result, bond yields become distorted, and central banks print more money to reduce the government\u2019s debt. More so, he revealed that when real yields turn negative, traditional government bonds become unattractive investments. Investors are then compelled to seek alternative assets capable of outpacing inflation, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which possess a finite supply and are immune to the debasement afflicting fiat currencies. The Bitmex co-founder further contends that the polarized political landscape in the United States, particularly leading up to the 2024 presidential election, will only worsen this trend. With both major parties vying for power and promising extensive spending programs, the incentive to maintain negative real yields and facilitate unchecked borrowing will intensify. Don\u2019t Leave the Left Curve As the summer months approach, the crypto trader advises his colleagues to seize the opportunity presented by recent market dips and token launches to accumulate positions strategically. In his post, he stated: \u201cThis is the perfect time to take advantage of the recent crypto dip to slowly add to positions\u2026..Whatever the flavour of crypto risk excites you, the next few months will present a golden opportunity to add to positions.\u201d He remains steadfast in his conviction that the overarching macro narrative of currency devaluation and relentless money printing will continue to fuel the crypto bull market, rewarding those who embrace the \u201cLeft Curve\u201d mentality and hold their ground. next Don\u2019t Ignore Left Curve: Arthur Hayes Explains Why Crypto Will Continue to Surge","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Don\u2019t Ignore Left Curve: Arthur Hayes Explains Why Crypto Will Continue to Surge While certain traders take pride in their recent successes, the real crypto legends are those who adopted the \"Left Curve\" mindset during the bear market spanning from 2021 to 2023.

From the anticipated reduction in miner rewards to the surging price of Bitcoin, the event holds massive significance to the industry. However, the recently concluded Bitcoin halving 2024 brought some new revelations to the fore as it marked a significant shift in transaction patterns due to the introduction of Bitcoin Runes. On the day, Runes accounted for a staggering 57.7% of all transactions in a move that appears to signal the beginning of a new era of Bitcoin transactions. Runes are a new form of data embedded directly into Bitcoin transactions. Unlike typical financial transfers, Runes contain additional information, ranging from simple messages to complex contract-like scripts. This technology operates using a method known as \u201ctransaction augmentation.\u201d It allows users to embed arbitrary data into transaction outputs, all while leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s secure framework. However, it is worth noting that the launch of Runes on halving day was a master strategy. It aimed to leverage the heightened market attention to maximize visibility and impact. Good and Bad Impact of Bitcoin Runes While the attempt to ride the buzz of halving day worked, Runes also had a significant impact on the market, both good and bad. For the good part, Bitcoin miners saw a significant increase in earnings due to the Runes protocol. On the halving day, miner revenue soared to a record $107 million despite the 50% reduction in block rewards. Additionally, being that the Runes protocol\u2019s launch coincided with the halving block, it drew significant interest, particularly among meme coin and nonfungible token (NFT) enthusiasts. The demand for block space ended up creating some of the most lucrative blocks in Bitcoin\u2019s history. The downside on the day was that the network saw an unprecedented surge in transaction fees, with daily fees hitting a new all-time high. Although the fees got back to normal levels the next day, the average transaction fee remains higher than pre-halving levels. There was also network congestion from the activities on the Bitcoin network, further pointing to the influence of Runes. Interestingly, however, the Runes trend could not impact the number of new Bitcoin addresses. This means that the activity was driven by existing users rather than new investors. Without a doubt, the introduction of Bitcoin Runes has left a significant mark on the cryptocurrency world. More so, with its effect on transaction patterns and miner revenue. However, it may still take a while to determine if these implications would be short-lived or long-term. next Runes Accounted for Over 57% of Bitcoin Transactions on Halving Day, Here\u2019s Why","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Runes Accounted for Over 57% of Bitcoin Transactions on Halving Day, Here\u2019s Why Bitcoin miners saw a significant increase in earnings due to the Runes protocol.

In a sentencing document submitted on April 23, 2024, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) argued Zhao should spend 3 years in prison and a $50 million penalty for his role in enabling Binance to breach federal sanctions and anti-money laundering regulations. The Department of Justice\u2019s decision to extend the potential sentence from 18 months to 3 years imprisonment marks a substantial increase in the case against Zhao. DOJ justified this harsh punishment by highlighting the \u201cmassive scope and ramifications\u201d of Zhao\u2019s actions. DOJ Criticizes Binance\u2019s Systemic AML Failures The memo details show how Binance, under Zhao\u2019s leadership, allegedly neglected the robust anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. DOJ asserted that lack of security enabled illicit actors to misuse the exchange for various criminal endeavors. These activities included operating cryptocurrency mixing services to conceal fund origins and ownership, as well as laundering proceeds from ransomware attacks. \u201cIn part because Zhao failed to implement an effective AML program at Binance, illicit actors used Binance\u2019s exchange in various ways, including operating mixing services that hid the source and ownership of cryptocurrency,\u201d said the filling. The filing emphasizes that these violations weren\u2019t isolated incidents but a systematic problem within Binance\u2019s operations. The Department of Justice highlighted that the exchange knowingly operated within the United States despite lacking appropriate licensing and compliance protocols. While the $50 million penalty for Binance remains, the DOJ\u2019s push for a longer prison sentence, an aggressive stance against Binance and its top executives. This firm stance impacts the industry, signaling stricter enforcement from US authorities despite maintaining the agreed monetary penalty. Adding another layer to the ongoing debate centers around Binance\u2019s global operations. Although the firm states Dubai as its base, the US Department of Justice contends it operated within America\u2019s borders. This disagreement adds further muddying the waters of international cryptocurrency regulation. Changpeng Zhao\u2019s Fate Pending The founder of Binance will attend his sentencing hearing on April 30, 2024. Zhao has given up his right to appeal any sentence up to 18 months. However, the Department of Justice\u2019s suggestion could lead to a longer sentence. Moreover, uncertainty surrounds Zhao\u2019s ability to reunite with his family, residing in Dubai. Meanwhile, Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has already admitted guilt and agreed to a $4.3 billion fine. The exchange is also subject to oversight from a court-appointed monitor, who has yet to be named. The situation surrounding Binance and CZ highlights the ongoing regulatory scrutiny faced by the cryptocurrency industry. The DOJ\u2019s strong stance sends a clear message: the era of unchecked crypto exchanges operating outside the law may be coming to an end. next DOJ Seeks 3-Year Imprisonment for Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao","article_summary":"Coinspeaker DOJ Seeks 3-Year Imprisonment for Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao While the $50 million penalty for Binance remains, the DOJ pushes for an aggressive stance against Binance and its top executives.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $396 billion and a daily average traded volume of around $11 billion, rallied around 3 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $3,249. Having closed last week on a bullish outlook, with a Doji weekly candlestick, Ethereum price is aiming to retest its all-time high in the near term. Furthermore, short-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders have already begun distributing their profits to the altcoin market in the ongoing crypto cash rotation. Spot Ethereum ETF Final Decision on the Horizon The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a month to the official deadline for its decision on the spot Ether ETF applications. The multiple fund managers that received the green light to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year are the same ones in the race to offer spot Ether ETFs. Notably, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was largely influenced by the court, which compelled the US SEC to use the same parameters for ETFs as the futures previously approved. With the US Ethereum futures having been in existence for several years, there is a high chance the US SEC could follow the same trend. However, the agency has been arguing that Ethereum is more of a security than a commodity than Bitcoin. Some experts have argued that the US SEC might not want to approve the spot Ether ETFs as other altcoins will follow the same path led by Ripple-backed XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), among others. Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments LLC filed with the SEC its form S-3 prospectus on April 23 in its bid to convert its Ethereum Trust to a spot Ether ETF. Notably, Grayscale now has all the required documents filed with the US SEC, thus leaving the agency to decide.

Through this list, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the leading platforms in the rapidly growing field of crypto staking. What is Crypto Staking? Crypto staking is a process where users lock up their cryptocurrency assets in order to validate transactions on a blockchain network and earn rewards for doing so. This method of earning income from crypto assets has gained popularity due to its relatively low risk compared to other forms of investments, such as Proof-of-Work mining. Staking essentially involves contributing to the security and stability of a blockchain network, and in return, the user receives a portion of the transaction fees or newly created coins as a reward. This also helps in maintaining the decentralization and consensus of a blockchain network, making it more secure and efficient. Factors to Consider When Choosing a Staking Platform When considering which staking platform to use, there are several factors to keep in mind. These include the reputation and track record of the platform, its security measures, staking rewards and fees, user experience, and customer support. It is essential to thoroughly research each platform and assess how well it meets your specific needs before making a decision.

During this period, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the market\u2019s two largest cryptocurrencies, both experienced double-digit declines. These drops dashed the bulls\u2019 initial attempts to drive prices higher and offset the positive impact of the ETF\u2019s financial capital injection into the market. Since then, the market is on the path to recovery, and as the halving event has started, investors are increasingly anticipating the start of a bull market by late April. Amid this market recovery, opportunities like BEFE don\u2019t emerge twice in a long lifetime. BEFE is expected to ride on the tide of this massive market resurgence to the very top of the market. Read on as we discuss two issues: the market recovery and BEFE, an investment opportunity of a lifetime. Market Recovery Bound to Happen Next Week Nearly a week has passed, and the overall trading volume in the market has fallen just above the $100 billion threshold. In the last 24 hours, the market value of Bitcoin has rebounded by nearly 3%. This uptick in price action came shortly after Bitcoin fell to a lower low of $59,698 early on Friday. Market experts are in support of a total turn-around in the price action of Bitcoin and the others early next week. They believe that the alignment of key market conditions, such as macroeconomics and increased buying pressure, will be sufficient to drive the market upward. BEFE, An Investment Opportunity Of A Lifetime While BEFE might be a relatively new meme coin on the market, after a launch without presale or imposed taxes last December, BEFE might just be the most lucrative project of 2024. Since its debut in the market scene, BEFE\u2019s price performance has left investors and crypto enthusiasts short of words, racking up an impressive 500% in less than four weeks and enjoying successive pumps of 300% and 200% in the next few weeks. BEFE\u2019s impressive performance in price action has pulled in investors of all categories from all over the market. Beyond BEFE\u2019s purpose of restoring the golden days of meme coins, BEFE also adds utility by partnering with reputable players like Bitgert. Through the partnership, $BEFE could be earned when users stake $BRISE within Bitgert\u2019s ecosystem. Moreover, BEFE\u2019s strategic alliances with the big players have increased its market credibility and its potential for further developments in the long term, which resonates with savvy investors in the market. BEFE, now one of the biggest hypes in the market, has become one of the most discussed projects within the crypto community. With a profit potential of 40x before June, opportunities like BEFE don\u2019t appear twice. Don\u2019t miss out on BEFE; instead, ride on the BEFE train to prosperity in 2024.

Let\u2019s also see how Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin is going to perform in the coming months and why. The Bitgert Growth in the Community Bitgert was launched in the market in late 2021 and that too for supporting the decentralization task and improving the current work status of blockchain networks. The Bitgert was introduced solely to fight the conventional blockchain networks and the lack of innovation. It can be said that Bitgert is a direct competitor to Bitcoin in terms of the tech used. Bitgert makes use of the latest innovations and has PoA and PoS consensus mechanisms as a mixture of the two. The combination of these two mechanisms helps in reducing the need for computation and also the number of validators. Moreover, the Bitgert chain offers all the transactions at 100k TPS which makes the whole network go viral for the speed itself. The speed does not compromise on safety either as safety protocols make Bitgert one of the most efficient and secure networks. The near-zero gas fee for each transaction has made the use of Bitgert quite viable for the users. The benefits of all these features aren\u2019t just for the users, but Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin also capitalizes on this. The Market Performance of Bitgert\u2019s BRISE Coin Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin has made a name for itself in the crypto market already. Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin was introduced to the market in 2024 and since then, it has already risen by nearly 40,000% in the market. People can earn huge profits from Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin through its sailing in the market to reach the top spot. Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin runs on a deflationary mechanism which pushes up the price through a reduction in supply with increasing demand for the token. Then the increasing market cap of the token makes it much more trustworthy for investments. Even the market correction could not stop Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin train and it made nearly 70% in profit. Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin has an RSI score over 55 which means that there is a strong buy signal for the token. The MACD value, moving average and the trading volume of the token are also increasing rapidly. Conclusion It can be seen that Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin has been having the time of its life since its launch. Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin does not need any support as it already has a lot of features to speed up it. So, if anyone wants to invest in any asset, then Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin seems to be the best option. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

This impressive ROI underscores the token\u2019s past performance, despite the recent challenges it has faced in the market. Investors and observers are closely monitoring GMT\u2019s price movements, particularly in light of today\u2019s modest recovery. While the token has faced downward pressure in recent times, the influx of capital from early investors and contributors suggests continued confidence in the project\u2019s long-term potential. Overall, while the GMT token may have experienced a period of decline, today\u2019s uptick and the ongoing support from early investors indicate resilience within the project. As the market continues to evolve, investors will be watching closely to see if this recovery marks the beginning of a sustained upward trend for GMT.

DePINs, leveraging blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), aim to enhance data sovereignty, reduce dependency on centralized models, and improve system resilience against potential failures. The research specifically highlights and evaluates Acurast, a new decentralized serverless cloud network that capitalizes on underutilized resources of smartphones to perform complex computing tasks with enhanced security and efficiency. Key Findings Enhanced Efficiency: Acurast has shown potential to perform computationally intensive tasks more efficiently than traditional cloud services like Google Cloud Platform and Amazon AWS. Power Efficiency: Acurast significantly reduce power consumption, compared to existing centralized server infrastructure, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to existing solutions. Empirical Evidence: The study provides empirical evidence supporting the theoretical benefits of DePINs, demonstrating Acurast\u2019s ability to handle computationally intensive applications with reliability and cost-effectiveness. \u201cThe advent of decentralized technologies presents a unique opportunity to rethink how we manage and operate digital infrastructures,\u201d said Jan von der Assen, PhD student and Junior Researcher of the Communication Systems Group (CSG) at the University of Zurich (UZH) on the project. \u201cAcurast not only challenges the status quo but may also present a scalable, secure, and sustainable model for future computing needs.\u201d This research marks a significant step toward understanding and harnessing the power of DePINs for computing. It opens up a real alternative to existing cloud providers for applications in all industries, especially where confidentiality is paramount.

Worldcoin price hovered around $5.48 on Wednesday, flat on the day after paring earlier gains. The scenario that the supply of Worldcoin increases by up to the above number of coins stems from plans outlined in a blog post published on April 23. \u201cTo meet the increasing demand for orb-verified World IDs around the world and support the growth of the Worldcoin network, World Assets Ltd. (a subsidiary of the Worldcoin Foundation) expects to sell WLD tokens from the World Assets treasury in the coming months,\u201d Worldcoin Foundation said in the announcement. In particular, World Assets is looking to sell between 500,000 to 1.5 million WLD tokens every week for six months. The tokens will account for about 0.1% to 0.4% of Worldcoin\u2019s weekly trading volume. According to the blog post, the tokens are from the World Assets treasury and will be sold via private sales to non-US institutional trading firms. \u201cThese private placements of WLD will take place for up to 6 months and will include certain measures designed to prevent WLD sold outside the US from flowing back into the US,\u201d Worldcoin Foundation team noted. Worldcoin (WLD) token price If World Assets sells the expected weekly total of up to 1.5 million WLD tokens (worth about $8.2 million) the total sales for the six months could reach 36 million tokens. The value of the new WLD supply hitting the market could be up to $197 million, given current WLD token price of $5.48.

Worldcoin (WLD) price today is up about 9.7% in the past week and down by about 36% in the past 30 days. Regulatory headwinds and slowdown in AI tokens is likely behind the decline this past month. However, WLD price is more than 456% up since its all-time low of $0.9731 reached in September last year. The token launched in July 2023, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, Worldcoin surged to its all-time high of $11.74, getting tailwinds from the broader AI narrative. Worldcoin\u2019s plans for a new Ethereum layer-2 called World Chain also buoyed prices.

The Maelstrom family office head, is also bullish on altcoins and new token launches that he says present a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d after the recent crypto weakness. With the market likely to flip bullish in coming months, could this be the time to take advantage of the KangaMoon (KANG) presale? Arthur Hays explains bull market setup and potential opportunities BitMEX exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes is bullish on crypto rebounding after the recent dip, noting that prices could \u201cget sillier on the upside.\u201d This, he argued in his \u201cLeft Curve\u201d blog post, could be a \u2018golden opportunity\u201d for investors to add to their positions. In his opinion, the market is currently exiting \u201cthe window of weakness\u201d that likely followed the April 15 US tax payments and the recent Bitcoin halving event. While the factors that drove Bitcoin price from zero to $70k over the past decade may not be the same ones at play in the future, Hayes says the macro setup and the fiat liquidity surge that fueled BTC\u2019s staggering gains can only get more pronounced, particularly as \u201cthe sovereign debt bubble begins to burst.\u201d \u201cAs we enter the northern hemispheric summer and decision-makers enjoy a respite from reality, crypto volatility will decline. This is the perfect time to take advantage of the recent crypto dip to slowly add to positions,\u201d the BitMEX co-founder noted. Altcoins pounded during the latest dump, new token launches and presales are all likely to offer great entry points. These opportunities could materialise over the next few months. KangaMoon brings GameFi and SocialFi to meme world KangaMoon (KANG) is a new SocialFi and play-to-earn gaming project currently in presale. The project, which also taps into meme culture to spice up the epic game battles, has a strong pull due to what the native $KANG token offers to holders. With KangaMoon, the opportunities to earn more $KANG and other exclusive rewards are available right from the presale stage. Kangaverse is the GameFi platform\u2019s ecosystem for contests and tournaments. $KANG holders can access these chances to earn more tokens through weekly, monthly and quarterly competitions and game challenges. What makes KangaMoon a potentially great opportunity? What makes KangaMoon a potentially great investment opportunity is its current presale price. $KANG\u2019s value during the five stages of the token sale has increased from $0.005 to $0.0196, meaning early birds are looking at about 280% upside on the price. However, the current price is also likely to be a great entry point given market predictions for Bitcoin and the altcoin sector. Analysts are also bullish on play-to-earn, while meme coins may see a new leg of interest. A look at KangaMoon\u2019s performance as stage 5 of the presale nears a close shows a great deal of confidence in the project from early investors. KangaMoon has raised more than $5.2 million so far, with the final stage 48% sold out. Investors can take advantage of the 20% bonus available on all purchases to load up on what could be the next top big thing in SocialFi and P2E.

That view is supported by the performance of US equities like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500. The US dollar index (DXY) has also pulled back as geopolitical risks have faded. Bitcoin price has remained above $66,000 while altcoins like Pepe, Algorand, and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) have continued rising. BitBot ($BITBOT), on the other hand, has continued thriving as it raised over $2.8 million. Pepe price forecast The price of Pepe token bottomed at $0.0000039 earlier this month and then bounced back to a high of $0.0000080, its highest point since April 1st. It has soared by more than 100% from its lowest point this month. The token has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also risen in the past seven straight days, the longest winning streak in months. Pepe has also jumped above the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have all pointed upwards, meaning that it has momentum. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has remained above 20. Therefore, the outlook for the token is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $0.00010, which is about 26% above the current level. Algorand price prediction The Algorand price bottomed at $0.1490 this month and then bounced back as the crypto rally resumed. It has rebounded to $0.2616, its highest swing since April 1st of this year. The token has now pulled back and retreated to the key point at $0.2400. It has remained above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and the Ichimoku cloud indicator. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) index has also pointed upwards. Therefore, the pair will likely now move to a consolidation phase in the coming days and then resume the bull run. If this happens, the token will likely rise to the key resistance point at $0.30, which is about 30% above the current level. BitBot analysis Meanwhile, BitBot, an upcoming cryptocurrency, is doing remarkably well as demand for the token rises ahead of the eventual token listing. The developers have raised over $2.8 million from investors in its current stage. For starters, BitBot is a project that is aiming to transform the financial trading industry by creating a decentralized trading bot. The bot will be distributed using Telegram, an application used by more than 900 million users around the world. The network will have features like revenue sharing, exclusive access to $BITBOT holders, and governance. Therefore, the BitBot token is doing well as investors cheer its potential growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) and the financial services industry. You can buy the BitBot token here.

Gox\u2019s imminent $9B payout could impact Bitcoin (BTC)","author":"Charles Thuo","article_detailed_content":"Gox to distribute 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH, valued at over $9 billion, to creditors. The payout process could commence as early as next month. All eyes are on the impact of the payout on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash price especially after the bitcoin halving event. Mt. Gox, once a major player in the cryptocurrency exchange scene, faced a devastating hack in 2014, leading to its collapse. Now, nearly a decade later, the defunct exchange is preparing to distribute a significant sum of digital assets including approximately 142,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and 143,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), amounting to over $9 billion in total, to creditors. This impending payout has prompted concerns among market observers, with K33 Research highlighting the possibility of a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin in a report released on Tuesday. According to the analysts, the influx of Mt. Gox coins into the market could create downward pressure on BTC valuation in the coming weeks. Possible implications for Bitcoin (BTC) price K33 Research analysts have highlighted concerns that the influx of Mt. Gox\u2019s digital assets into the market could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price in the coming weeks. While creditors may not immediately liquidate their assets, the anticipation surrounding the payout could instil caution among investors, potentially dampening market sentiment. Creditors recently received updates on their BTC and BCH claims, indicating that payments could commence sooner than initially anticipated. This development, coupled with the looming deadline set by Mt. Gox trustees for reimbursements, has intensified speculation within the crypto community. Market observers remain divided on the potential impact of Mt. Gox\u2019s payout on Bitcoin\u2019s price. While some believe that creditors may opt to hold onto their funds, others fear that the sheer volume of digital assets entering the market could trigger a sell-off, leading to a temporary downturn in prices. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Mt. Gox\u2019s payout, the crypto market continues to show resilience in the face of external pressures. However, investors are advised to exercise caution and closely monitor developments related to the distribution process to mitigate any adverse effects on their portfolios especially according to the K33 Research analysts warning.

In response to the news, XTB's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) tested historical highs on Wednesday. 75% of XTB\u2019s 2023 Profit Allocated for Dividend According to information published by the company this week, the Management Board of XTB adopted a resolution recommending the allocation of 75% of the company's net profit for 2023, amounting to PLN 787 million ($195 million), for dividend payment. The remaining part, PLN 197 million ($49 million), will supplement the company's reserve capital. \"The Management Board of XTB proposes a dividend record date of 5 June 2024 and a dividend payment date of 20 June 2024,\" the XTB statement read. This means that XTB will pay PLN 5.02 ($1.24) per share, which gives a dividend yield of 7.2%. However, this yield is lower than in the previous year due to the strong increase in the share price on the WSE. XTB's shares grew by nearly 22% last year and are already growing by over 60% this year. The information about the dividend payment triggered another growth impulse, and on Wednesday, the shares briefly gained almost 2%, setting a new historical high at PLN 62.30. However, the good streak does not only concern XTB itself. Plus, 500 shares on the LSE have been growing by 30% since the beginning of the year, and historical highs, around 2200 pence per share, have also been tested. Net profit is not the only factor contributing to investors' confidence in XTB. Primarily, it is the continuous increase in the number of clients and plans for product and geographical expansion. XTB Has over One Million Clients XTB, which no longer wants to be associated as an FX/CFD broker but as a \"global fintech,\" certainly has many reasons for this. At the beginning of this month, the company announced that its number of clients had exceeded the milestone of one million, doubling over the past three years. In the meantime, the company has introduced many new products, including passive trading tools based on ETFs. In 2024, it already put a social trading platform in users' hands. Soon, it will also offer the possibility of trading bonds. According to information from February, XTB counts on expansion in the British market, where it wants to join the ¬£400 billion Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) industry. The expansion also goes beyond the old continent, and an example of this is the acquisition of a broker in Indonesia, which is to become a \"Gateway to Asia\" for the company.

According to a report by CNBC, the prosecutors argued that such a sentence, which is double the advisory guidelines, reflects the seriousness of the charges against Zhao. The recommendation, outlined in a sentencing memorandum filed with the Western District Court of Washington, highlights the severity of the accusations against Zhao, who stepped down from his position last November following a plea deal with the US Department of Justice. US Prosecutors' Charges Against Zhao US prosecutors said a 36-month custodial sentence is necessary to underscore the seriousness of the charges against Zhao, which include failure to implement anti-money laundering measures as mandated by the Bank Secrecy Act. The memorandum emphasized Zhao's alleged role in allowing Binance to process transactions involving unlawful activities, including those from sanctioned countries. The case against Zhao occurs amidst a backdrop of legal challenges for Binance, with the exchange facing lawsuits from both the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Allegations include mishandling customer assets and operating an illegal, unregistered exchange in the US. Authorities have also ordered Binance to pay hefty fines, with Zhao agreeing to a $50 million penalty as part of the plea deal. However, he has not publicly commented on the recent developments. Zhao's official sentencing is scheduled for April 30. Binance CEO's Legal Struggle In January, a federal judge rejected a travel request from Zhao to visit his home in the United Arab Emirates for a family emergency. The judge deemed him a significant flight risk due to his immense wealth and ties to the UAE, despite offering to post his $4.5 billion equity in Binance as security for his return. In November, Zhao pleaded guilty in a Seattle federal court to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. As part of the case, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in penalties. In a letter to Judge Richard Jones dated December 22, Zhao's lawyers requested permission for him to travel to Abu Dhabi on January 4 for one to four weeks due to a family emergency. However, federal prosecutors did not consent to Zhao's request, leading to a hearing on December 29, where Judge Jones denied the travel bid.

Situated in Dubai, the exchange has revealed an exhaustive rebranding effort alongside the debut of its Proprietary Trading (Prop Trading) product. Introducing Prop Trading for Profit Opportunities Having cemented its position within the digital assets trading industry, CoinW Exchange is now set to enter a fresh phase of development. A centrepiece of its transformation is the launch of the Prop Trading product, an offering aimed at providing traders with expanded avenues for profit optimization. This new product is set to play a role in CoinW Exchange's strategic outlook for the future according to the firm. According to Sonic, Director of CoinW PropTrading: \"We have a host of exciting plans in the pipeline that promise to revolutionize the way digital assets are traded. We hope CPT can bring more opportunities to talented traders who are short of fund. CoinW will be the place that they can truly shine.\" Challenges and Opportunities: UAE's Crypto Journey A recent survey by KuCoin sheds light on the growing cryptocurrency landscape in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as reported by Finance Magnates. Despite challenges, 59% of UAE crypto users view it as a long-term investment and 35% use it for portfolio diversification. Additionally, 29% see crypto as a more convenient asset storage method than traditional banks, and 22% use it for daily transactions. Challenges include market volatility (52%), trust issues with crypto platforms (48%), and a lack of education (26%). However, the UAE benefits from strong financial infrastructure, cultural openness, regulatory favorability, access to capital, a skilled workforce, and global networks, positioning it as a promising hub for crypto industry growth. Amidst escalating tensions, MetaQuotes is reportedly tightening restrictions on the use of MetaTrader platforms, although no official confirmation has been issued. This has led to the abrupt termination of partnerships between many proprietary trading firms and their brokerage partners. The primary concern appears to be the presence of active US clients onboarded by these platforms. Proprietary trading has been predominantly linked with unregulated entities. However, regulated brokerages such as OANDA, Axi, and Hantec Markets have recently ventured into this space, keeping their services outside the US jurisdiction and under offshore regulatory entities.

With the rise of the customer-centric economy, people expect personalized, on-demand interactions from all brands\u2014not just the Big Tech players. So how can banks, fintech, credit unions, and even DeFI firms rise to meet these growing expectations and make their users excited to interact with their products/services? Let\u2019s dive into a few strategies. Segment and Specialize Your Marketing Outreach Gone are the days where you can just send out blanket promotions and hope that they hit the mark. The customers of today demand a lot more than that, specifically when it comes to communications catering to their specific niches, needs, and interests. If your target market is fintech adopters who prioritize sleek digital experiences, then it's going to be best if you tailor your marketing strategy to highlight intuitive mobile apps and seamless account opening experiences. If you\u2019re in the DeFi space, you're going to need a blockchain marketing strategy that speaks directly to their concerns. In this case, you may want to play up things like transparency and security for the crypto crowd, detailing blockchain protections and your decentralization efforts. At the same time, these messages will be completely lost to someone uninterested in the Web3 space. As always, it pays to know your audience - so drill down into the key demographics. Young investors may be cost-conscious but risk-tolerant, valuing fractional share offerings from disruptors like Robinhood. Near-retirees may want retirement planning and portfolio protection. Here, outline annuities and capital preservation funds that guarantee income for people depending on nest eggs in volatile times. Consider diverse locations and languages as well - are you connecting with rural communities? Speaking to recent immigrant groups through multilingual touchpoints? The more you segment and specialize your marketing efforts, the better. Add Interactive Elements and Gamification Let\u2019s be honest\u2014static content doesn\u2019t fully engage anymore in the TikTok era. Bring financial concepts to life through simulations, live quizzes, an friendly competition through gamification. To give some examples, investment apps could incorporate fantasy trading leagues where newcomers track other people\u2019s portfolios. Get people active in the experience! For account holders, create gaming aspects around saving goals too. Set up digital \u201cjars\u201d for vacations, weddings, etc. that people contribute towards for rewards. Encourage consistency through points systems that unlock real perks. Making progress visible and fun drives motivation. One thing that many brands have found success with is tying rewards to financial literacy education for new account holders too. Not only does this help money concepts stick better, but it aids with compliance and demonstrates to regulators that you are taking user education seriously. Facilitate Sharing and Conversation Humans naturally want to connect with others regarding financial matters because money impacts almost all life pursuits, including well-being and security. Yet, discussing finances still feels taboo to some. That\u2019s why branded online forums, webinars, and social media groups resonate by providing judgment-free spaces where people can open up. To take it one step further, you could Invite account holders behind-the-scenes too with exclusive virtual events. Let them engage experts through live Q&As and AMAs. Make it easy to participate through apps and tools with frictionless access. Thought leadership positioning also helps to cement your role as a trusted advisor too. Share investment philosophies, fraud warnings, and tips aligned to audience values. Facilitating two-way conversations through consistent digital engagement makes your brand part of people\u2019s financial lives. Lead with Emotional Storytelling Facts and figures don\u2019t stick with people...but stories do. Plant memories by showing how you\u2019ve helped everyday users overcome obstacles or achieve meaningful goals. Maybe it\u2019s assisting special needs families with securing care resources through insurance proceeds. Or retirement planning that enabled a couple to finally sail their dream boat in the Mediterranean after years of working. When people see themselves in examples, that forges powerful connections. Weave in how you navigated recent societal challenges too, like helping businesses access loans or other lines of credit during the pandemic. People invest in brands aligned with their values and principles, so showcasing your positive impacts through storytelling really helps to create those deep emotional bonds. Adopt Cutting-Edge Technology Today's customers expect financial products and services to continually upgrade technologically. After sticking with the same bank for 10 years, account holders don't want to log into an interface that hasn\u2019t been refreshed since opening day. Nothing frustrates people more than outdated digital experiences in the era of lightning-fast innovation. With this in mind, financial brands should obsess over CX improvement by rapidly adopting emerging innovations like AI and automation. Chatbots utilizing natural language processing can provide personalized support and financial advice at scale. Intelligent algorithms can perform rapid fraud detection and hyper-customize product recommendations for each individual. Be proactive here - run small beta tests with willing groups open to new technology. Involve users early for productive feedback, not just after the fact when they\u2019re already irritated. The truth is, pursuing a culture of experimentation and adaptation sets firms up for long-term relevance, compared to rigid bureaucracies that always seem to lag behind customer expectations. Final Word The world of finance is evolving faster than ever before. If brands want to keep up, then they must abandon the old school way of thinking and start embracing the customer obsessed mindset of today's most successful companies. This means going beyond just offering financial products. Instead, this means offering hyper personalized experiences that are interactive and woven into the fabric of people's lives. By segmenting your marketing, adding gamified elements, sparking open conversations, and leading with cutting edge tech, you can transform your brand from a faceless money management service into a trusted partner.

FBS financial market analysts have identified the pivotal factors driving the bullish trend for gold and covered the potential strategies for CFD traders. Gold is among the assets characterized by stability and resilience in the financial markets, making it an appealing instrument for investors. FBS analysts foresee an upward trend for gold in Q2 and on until the end of the year. They associate the bullish tendency with significant central bank buying, continued inflationary pressures in the global economy, and increased demand for gold from non-institutional investors. Central banks worldwide are actively fortifying their gold reserves, signaling a strategic shift towards safer assets in the context of escalating geopolitical tensions. FBS financial market analysts point out that hedging and diversification of reserves has recently become typical of the People's Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Turkey, and others. Inflationary pressures stemming from aftershocks of the global pandemic, military conflicts, rising oil prices, and complications within prominent maritime trade routes push gold prices further. According to FBS analysts, inflationary pressures are increasing the attractiveness of gold as a hedge against currency devaluation and declining purchasing power. Non-institutional investors are increasingly gravitating towards gold as a store of value and a means of portfolio diversification. Total gold demand, including over-the-counter markets, surged to historic highs in 2023, fueled by economic uncertainty and evolving investment preferences, particularly in China. Another critical factor affecting the increased demand for gold is the interest of non-institutional investors. Financial markets analysts from FBS indicate that the total gold demand, including OTC markets, reached a new annual record in 2023 at approximately 4,899 tons. FBS analysts suggest taking a closer look at China's gold market, which is experiencing a noticeable surge in demand, to understand the current trend better. Looking closely at the XAUUSD trajectory in the weekly timeframe, FBS analysts underscore a bullish trend. Gold has updated its ATH, and the price is actively testing the $2,400 resistance, corresponding to 161.8 Fibonacci. If XAUUSD manages to break this level, investors can expect gold to rise further to $2,800, which coincides with the 261.8 Fibonacci level. However, if there is a correction, the price may fall to the support at $2,200 and then rush up to $2,800. Regarding trading strategies, FBS\u2019s experts stress the importance of prudent risk management amidst bullish market conditions. Strategies such as controlling position sizes, limiting trade deposits to 2-10% of the total portfolio, and employing stop-loss orders are recommended to safeguard capital and encourage diversification. These actions can be easily performed at the enhanced FBS app, which allows traders to seize market opportunities on the go, anytime. Additionally, FBS analysts recommend aligning with the prevailing market trend and utilizing technical analysis tools like moving averages, RSI, and MACD.

That means that we all need a home office, or at least a corner where we can catch up on vital tasks. Welcome to Part 2 of our ultimate home office setup guide.

Are you getting the best possible service? There\u2019s nothing more soul-destroying than wasting time downloading files when you could be cracking on, so consider investing in a decent router. If the router\u2019s OK, you might look into signal extenders or boosters to make sure you\u2019re getting all the bars you need.

Hopefully you\u2019re almost paper-free, but we\u2019d advise getting a simple, wired printer that can sit close enough, but out of the way, only turned on when you absolutely need it.

Webcam cables. Cables, cables, cables.

It seemed pretty out there, and a bit too risky for most people to entertain. But flash forward to today, and the crypto industry is now worth more than $2 trillion. Yet, even with that growth, many would argue that crypto adoption still has a long way to go before hitting the mainstream. So, what is the main obstacle holding these blockchain-based assets from taking over the world? Well, the truth is that most people still have very little idea of what Bitcoin and its digital counterparts actually do (and how they work). This is especially true amongst the older generations who may feel alienated from the fast-paced and lingo-ridden communities that form the bedrock of Web3. To put this into perspective, a recent survey found that only 11% of people admit they truly understand crypto(23% of younger people). This knowledge gap, paired with the mixed messages about crypto in the media, makes many doubtful or hesitant to get involved. So, as the crypto space evolves, it's up to the projects actively involved in the space to tackle these lingering doubts and skepticism head on. One of the best ways to do this is through a well-crafted crypto press release that aims to spread understandable, easily digestible, benefits-based information to a wider demographic. Let\u2019s unpack this in a bit more detail. Explain Complex Concepts Simply Let's face it, the technology power and cryptocurrency, blockchain, is not exactly the easiest thing to wrap your head around. Unless you're a software engineer or a text savant, distributed digital ledgers aren\u2019t likely to be something that will come naturally to you. And that's without even mentioning things like cryptographic hashes, mining, wallets, private keys, and exchanges. The learning curve is steep. In press releases, especially ones that are going out to mainstream publications and not just crypto native media, It's important to break down these complex topics into straightforward language. Don't mention buzzwords, define them in everyday terms and provide simple, relatable examples. For example, Instead of saying something like \"blockchain technology ensures the immutability of transactions,\" you could say something like, \u201cimagine a shared digital notebook where everyone in the world can see what's written in it. Once something has been written down, it can't be changed, edited, modified, or removed. That's exactly how blockchain works.\u201d Of course, there's a balance to be had here. You want to try and simplify the concepts without oversimplifying them to the point where they lose their nuance. The goal is to convey the core concepts simply while keeping explanations accurate. This helps people that are just getting their feet wet understand in space understand what the basic mechanics behind this technology are. Clear the Air on Misconceptions We live in a world of fake news - a world where people deliberately go out of their way to misguide others. In the crypto sphere, this is done by both bad actors trying to scam unsuspecting users, and mainstream media that have an obvious negative agenda against crypto. To give another example, there is still plenty of news coverage going around that Bitcoin and other digital assets are solely used for things like money laundering, drug dealing and other illicit activities. Press releases provide an excellent opportunity to directly address and debunk these misleading and extremely damaging claims. The key is to rise above the noise, take the high road, and take time to explain the fundamentals. By clearing up these common misconceptions, companies can reassure people who may be hesitant to adopt crypto and jump on board. It also counters all the negative hype in the media. When people learn the facts through a trusted medium, they are likely to gain more trust in cryptocurrencies as legitimate technologies with incredible potential. Highlight Real-World Utility One of the more common criticisms that crypto receives is that it doesn't have any real use case. On the one hand, this is more than fair if you're talking about the thousands and thousands of tokens that are simply made as gash grabs and pump and dump schemes. But of course, there's far more to blockchain technology than that. Legitimate cryptocurrency projects solve real-world problems across a variety of industries - from finance and healthcare to supply chain and identity. The key is showcasing these actual uses in a way that clearly conveys the benefits to end-users. For example, a supply chain focused blockchain could demonstrate how it increases transparency, efficiency and trust between all parties involved. This eliminates issues like cargo theft, spoilage, unnecessary paperwork, and payment delays. Almost everybody is going to be able to see the profound benefits that this brings. When tangible improvements like these are presented, it becomes far easier for someone to recognize the utility and subsequently gain interest in utilizing crypto. Focus on Accessibility As mentioned in the introduction, lack of technical knowledge poses a significant barrier to crypto adoption. If people don't understand how to acquire, store and use digital assets, they simply won't. Press releases present the perfect chance to educate readers on the proper procedures for getting started. Rather than assuming any prior familiarity, pretend you're talking to a complete beginner. Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a wallet, buying crypto on an exchange, storing private keys, and making basic transactions. You'd be surprised just how many people have no idea that you can purchase a fraction of Bitcoin rather than needing to buy a whole one. Small details like that can make all the difference. Of course, it also helps to point people in the direction of useful educational resources where they can learn more at their own pace. Creating easily adoptable systems lays the groundwork for bringing more participants into the cryptoverse. Final Word The journey from skepticism to adoption is definitely going to be a long one for crypto space. It's safe to say that great strides have definitely been made over the past 15 years, but more work needs to be done. For the companies that act as stewards to the blockchain industry, well-crafted press releases that address concerns head on, simplify complex concepts, and break down real life practical benefits will only help to bridge the gap between the crypto-curious and the crypto-confident.

Meanwhile, his trial is scheduled for May 2. More Jail Time in Nigeria The extension of Gambaryan\u2019s remand was granted by the Nigerian court yesterday (Tuesday) amid opposition from federal prosecutors to the appeal for bail. The crypto exchange\u2019s executive has already pleaded not guilty to charges of tax evasion and money laundering. Gambaryan holds the position of Head of Financial Crime Compliance at the crypto exchange. He and another fellow Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who holds the position of its African Regional Manager, traveled to Nigeria in an official capacity earlier this year but were detained by local authorities. Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission brought four counts of tax evasion charges against the exchange and the two detained executives. The charges primarily blame the defendants for non-payment of value-added tax, income tax, and failure to file tax returns.

If these roadblocks are resolved, India can become a $5 trillion economy by 2027, a Mecca for global business. What stands in the way of business in India? India can potentially become the USA of Asia, and compete with China in terms of investment. Multinational enterprises are expecting the said from India, for they see the potential of this market. However, hopes and dreams remain just that \u2013 hopes and dreams. But why is that so? India\u2019s business environment shows avid signs of hostility to both domestic businesses, and foreign capital, like moguls akin Tesla, Nokia, Parimatch. Firstly, exorbitant taxes and various tax bodies with own opinions on taxation rates. This trend is reflected in the studies that monitor taxation in the world. For example, according to the Paderborn University and the World Bank data on the Tax Complexity Index, India ranks 53rd out of 100 in terms of the tax code complexity, and 58th in terms of the tax system complexity. Vakil Search, a project for investors and entrepreneurs, illustrates what tax rates for businesses in India look like. It shows the tax load for non-residents is considerably above that of domestic companies. This is despite the fact that over 130 countries have agreed to adjust their taxation for multinationals. The global minimum tax rate is a minimum of 15% for multinationals with business revenues exceeding 750 million euros. In India, however, the corporate tax for international companies is above the average \u2013 30% compared to 23% globally, according to Sagar Narendrakumar Surana, a certified specialist in fintech sector. On top of that, India\u2019s taxmen have varying views on tax rates, with the tax administration system under constant reconstruction in attempt to bring all the moving parts to harmony. \u201cIndia has a string of tax authorities on different levels. This means that oftentimes various tax bodies present contradictory requirements, resulting in legal disputes. Hovewer, the government can make this process way easier by introducing electronic solutions, such as filling tax reports and paying taxes online\u201d, shares his expert opinon Mr. Surana. Business-friendly tax system could increase the investment influx into the country many times over. With Parimatch bookmaker being one of the first willing to invest in the Indian market. Tesla didn\u2019t make it in India As a result of excessive taxation, India\u2019s losing taxpayers that could significantly fuel the country\u2019s economy. One such example is Tesla. This carmaker put its strategies of EV sales in India on ice, for the agreement to lower the import tax for the manufacturer could not be reached with the state officials. The Indian government chose to stick to its official policy, forcing such companies to pay 60% tax on budget cars, with the tax amounting to 100% of the cost of cars priced above Rs. 3,000,000 (over 30 thousand euros) Which companies buckled under tax pressure? Business views India as the state with the most difficult tax administration system in the world. Due to poor predictability of tax legislation, many enterprises simply fail to react to new changes and policies, which results in major fines and tax bodies persecuting the business. \u201cRecent years have witnessed companies either move from India to other developing countries or downsizing their operational scale. This trend has not ceased to disappear even after our honorable Prime Minister invited companies from abroad to come and invest more capital in India\u2019s developing economy\u201d, it goes in a blogpost on the corporate tax in India. Companies like Amazon, Foxconn, and several other enterprises from Japan and South Korea faced major fines for the alleged concealment of investments, tax evasion, and account falsification in India. Embroiled in high-profile tax investigations were transnationals like Shell, Nokia, IBM, Walmart, and Cairn Energy. Some companies, Parimatch included, could not launch in India at all. As a result of the mentioned factors, foreign business keeps packing up and leaving the subcontinent. Recently, a couple of major players \u2013 Foxconn Group and Wistron Group \u2013 left this promising market. Indian courts still fighting to have the tax load reduced Businesses take to local courts to fight fines and rising taxes, but the struggle\u2019s been futile so far, says The Economic Times. Indian state authorities raised the gaming tax from 18% to 28%, as the E-gaming Federation tries to appeal this decision in court, filing 27 pleas. The companies wish that online gaming, along with horse racing and gambling, are taxed differently. India\u2019s government thinks otherwise. The parties keep butting heads. In the meantime, gambling companies appeal for cancellation of unreasonable fines imposed by the taxmen. For instance, several e-gaming companies \u2013 Gameskraft, Dream 11, Games 24x7, Head Digital Works \u2013 went to court to challenge the collection of goods and services tax (GST). Specifically, the Karnataka High Court verdict quashed the GST intimation notice on the tune of Rs 21,000 crore ($2 billion) issued to online gaming form Gameskraft. Still, India\u2019s Supreme Court suspended the enforcement of this decision, with the victory at arm\u2019s length. Business wants to protect intellectual property in India On top of the puzzling and incoherent tax policy, there\u2019s another obstacle in the way \u2013 lack of proper intellectual property protection. Counterfeits are common for the Indian market. International company Parimatch learned of this problem the hard way. The company is not officially represented on the Indian subcontinent, so the copycats waste no time hustling in India. Parimatch wants to invest in this market, pay taxes, and keep the gaming industry evolving through offering its own products and services. Limp measures to counter piracy and counterfeits impede the enterprises\u2019 attempts to invest in research and development, believes Vishwas Bhagwat, business head, educationist, computer network expert. He goes on to list the main obstacles for business in India that hinder the country\u2019s economy: overcomplicated regulations, arduous registration process, inconsistent taxation policies, insufficient protection of intellectual property. Mr. Bhagwat considers the said factors to be the most damaging to innovations and conducting business in the Indian market. Vietnam takes over Indian investments Sadly, India\u2019s current regulatory system hinders the accumulation of foreign capital, new jobs, savings, statesTaxguru publication. Meanwhile, cashflow from leading economies, like U.S. and China, moves to Vietnam, although it\u2019s much needed in India. \u201cWe want the foreign direct investment from China to shift, but Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is not flowing into India at the pace it should be. Instead, it\u2019s going to countries like Vietnam. I would selfishly like to see more of that happening in India\u201d, said Eric Garcetti, the U.S. Ambassador to India. Still, both domestic and foreign companies, Parimatch among them, are more than willing to invest millions of dollars in the Indian economy today, should the government create a more favorable environment for international capital.

For instance, several e-gaming companies \u2013 Gameskraft, Dream 11, Games 24x7, Head Digital Works \u2013 went to court to challenge the collection of goods and services tax (GST). Specifically, the Karnataka High Court verdict quashed the GST intimation notice on the tune of Rs 21,000 crore ($2 billion) issued to online gaming form Gameskraft. Still, India\u2019s Supreme Court suspended the enforcement of this decision, with the victory at arm\u2019s length. Business wants to protect intellectual property in India On top of the puzzling and incoherent tax policy, there\u2019s another obstacle in the way \u2013 lack of proper intellectual property protection. Counterfeits are common for the Indian market. International company Parimatch learned of this problem the hard way. The company is not officially represented on the Indian subcontinent, so the copycats waste no time hustling in India. Parimatch wants to invest in this market, pay taxes, and keep the gaming industry evolving through offering its own products and services. Limp measures to counter piracy and counterfeits impede the enterprises\u2019 attempts to invest in research and development, believes Vishwas Bhagwat, business head, educationist, computer network expert. He goes on to list the main obstacles for business in India that hinder the country\u2019s economy: overcomplicated regulations, arduous registration process, inconsistent taxation policies, insufficient protection of intellectual property. Mr. Bhagwat considers the said factors to be the most damaging to innovations and conducting business in the Indian market. Vietnam takes over Indian investments Sadly, India\u2019s current regulatory system hinders the accumulation of foreign capital, new jobs, savings, statesTaxguru publication. Meanwhile, cashflow from leading economies, like U.S. and China, moves to Vietnam, although it\u2019s much needed in India. \u201cWe want the foreign direct investment from China to shift, but Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is not flowing into India at the pace it should be. Instead, it\u2019s going to countries like Vietnam. I would selfishly like to see more of that happening in India\u201d, said Eric Garcetti, the U.S. Ambassador to India. Still, both domestic and foreign companies, Parimatch among them, are more than willing to invest millions of dollars in the Indian economy today, should the government create a more favorable environment for international capital.

In the meantime, the company joined forces with Standard Chartered to enhance cross-border payments. The global digital payments giant reported double-digit growth in revenue, net income, and earnings per share, driven by steady increases in payments volume, cross-border transactions, and processed transactions. Visa Posts Strong Q2 2024 Results amid Stable Growth in Key Metrics Net revenue for the quarter rose 10% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, reflecting the continued recovery in global economic activity. Visa's GAAP net income increased 10% to $4.7 billion, while non-GAAP net income grew 17% to $5.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) grew even stronger, with GAAP EPS up 12% to $2.29 and non-GAAP EPS surging 20% to $2.51. \u201cAs we head into the second half of the year and beyond, we remain focused on the trillions of dollars of opportunity in consumer payments and new flows,\u201d commented Ryan McInerney, the Chief Executive Officer of Visa. Visa's core business drivers demonstrated resilience, with payments volume increasing 8% on a constant-dollar basis for the three months ended 31 March 2024. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe transactions, rose 16%, indicating a rebound in international travel. Total processed transactions grew 11% to 55.5 billion, underscoring the ongoing shift towards digital payments. Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships During the quarter, Visa completed its acquisition of Pismo, a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform. This action enhances Visa's capabilities in providing innovative solutions to its clients. Additionally, the company reached a landmark settlement with US merchants, agreeing to lower credit interchange rates and implement rule changes that benefit small businesses. In the latest move, the payments again teamed up with the local US fintech Skipify for secured digital transactions. The cooperation aims to blend Visa\u2019s expertise and Skipify\u2019s innovative wallet solutions. Visa returned excess cash to shareholders through its stock repurchase program and quarterly dividends. The company repurchased 9.7 million shares of Class A common stock for $2.7 billion and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.520 per share, payable in June 2024. Staying on the topic of stocks, Visa's shares on Wall Street rose over 3% in after-hours trading, reacting to better-than-expected results and testing the highest price levels in over a month, around $284. Visa and Standard Chartered Partner to Streamline Cross-Border Payments In the meantime, Standard Chartered has joined forces with Visa to leverage the Visa B2B Connect network. This multilateral payment network enables faster and more cost-effective account-to-account payments for corporate clients worldwide. The partnership will initially benefit Standard Chartered's clients in Singapore, with plans to expand the offering to additional entities in the coming months. By integrating with Visa B2B Connect through API connectivity, transactions will be routed directly to Visa for processing, eliminating the need for multiple intermediaries and the associated costs and delays. \"Visa is committed to modernizing cross-border payments around the world, and the collaboration with Standard Chartered will extend our network even further,\" said Ben Ellis, the Senior Vice President and the Global Head of Visa B2B Connect at Visa.

QMAP employs a stringent due diligence process to select fund managers with proven track records of generating alpha and effectively managing risks across various market cycles. These managers bring institutional backgrounds, specialized expertise, and operational excellence to the table. \"I have high [hopes] that QMAP will quickly become the leading platform for sophisticated investors to invest in a diversified suite of crypto hedge funds,\u201d Yuko Seimei, the CEO of Monex Group, stated. The platform's managed account structure allows 3iQ direct control over assets, enhancing transparency and risk management capabilities. This approach eliminates the extra layer of fees typically found in traditional fund-of-funds structures, enabling investors to customize their allocations or choose from pre-designed model portfolios at no additional cost. \u201cTogether with Monex, we aim to create a superior investor experience that sets new standards globally,\u201d added Pascal St. Jean, the President of 3iQ. \"With a seasoned team, we remain committed to upholding our firm's decade-long tradition of developing cutting-edge investment solutions for institutional investors.\u201d The acquisition of 3iQ and investment in QMAP align with Monex Group's goal of strengthening its asset management business. Recently, the company has expanded its operations in the APAC region, planning to increase employment in the sales department by 80%.

The company\u2019s turnover almost halved from the previous year\u2019s ¬£4.46 million. The numbers are for the UK-registered entity, and not the entire group. A Significant Decline in Revenue In the official announcement today (Wednesday), the company attributed the revenue decline to the long-standing effects of the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and also to the \u201cexceptional growth\u201d of the company in 2022. Meanwhile, it highlighted that its revenue since the beginning of 2023 steadily increased month-over-month, and the trend remains intact even in the initial months of 2024. \u201cThe crypto winter had a huge impact across the industry, and GCEX was no exception,\u201d said Holst, the Founder and CEO at GCEX. \u201cHowever, in response to the decline in revenue, we have been resilient and adaptive, navigating our costs effectively and diversifying revenue streams, such as introducing staking services for institutional and professional clients.\u201d An End to Two Profitable Years The company further dived into losses after two consecutive profitable years. As Finance Magnates reported earlier, the company generated ¬£1.5 million in profits in 2022 and ¬£1.42 million in 2021. The company additionally pointed out that it distributed ¬£1.8 million to its parent company, GCEX Holding Limited, aimed to support the ongoing international expansion of the group.

According to the data from rwa.xyz, such addresses have climbed 15% this year alone, soaring to a record high of over 93.6 million. These digital assets, which maintain a 1:1 peg to external references like the US dollar, can be classified into three main types. They are fiat-backed, crypto-backed, and algorithmic stablecoins. Of all stablecoins, though, Tether (USDT) is unquestionably the biggest in terms of the number of holders. About 80% of all stablecoin addresses hold USDT, then closely followed by USDC and BUSD. As of this publication, there are 35 stablecoins in circulation with a collective market capitalization of $157 billion. Of that lot, Tether USDT boasts a market cap of $114.07 billion. As in the number of addresses that hold stablecoin, the number of addresses actively transferring stablecoins has also surged. March alone saw over 26 million active addresses, a record amount that signaled significant retail investor participation. These transactions took place primarily on TRON and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Meanwhile, despite their dominance in active address counts, TRON and BSC pale in comparison to Ethereum and Solana in terms of transfer volumes. Growing Use Cases It might be worth noting that the stablecoin holding addresses have been on a steady rise for months. Even during the 2022 crypto bear market and seemingly against all odds, the tally continued on the uptrend. According to analysts, that growth could be linked to increased investor interest in assets that promise more stability. Especially considering the rapid interest rate hikes that the Federal Reserve was implementing at the time. Besides, a 2022 Federal Reserve report also noted that there were rising use cases for stablecoins. These include and are not limited to cross-border payments, internal fund transfers, and liquidity management within firms. Furthermore, the versatile digital assets can serve an array of purposes depending on the geographical location. For instance, a country like Zimbabwe struggling with inflation would utilize stablecoins for payments, remittances, and store of value assets. More stable economies, on the other hand, may use stablecoins to facilitate crypto purchases. Rating agency S&P predicts that regulatory clarity will encourage banks to adopt stablecoins.

Crypto Analyst Offers Perspective on Raging Controversy","author":"Temitope Olatunji","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker Will Ethereum Be Classified as Security? Crypto Analyst Offers Perspective on Raging Controversy The cryptocurrency space has been in a debate concerning the approval of Ethereum as a security by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion has been ongoing for a considerable period, with various analysts and industry experts offering diverse perspectives on the matter\u2019s outcome. New York Attorney General Fuels the Debate Recently, a crypto analyst and legal adviser Metalaw weighed in on the matter, making reference to the action taken by New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James approximately a year ago. In this past move, Attorney General James made headlines by publicly asserting that Ethereum, one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market, is a security. Will @GaryGensler declare $ETH a security? Maybe. Don't forget, NYAG Letitia James already did this a year ago and issued a press release trumpeting the move. \"This action is one of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies\u2026 \u2014 MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) April 23, 2024 This assertion was made during a legal battle against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, where Ethereum was likened to LUNA and UST. James\u2019 argument hinges on the notion that ETH is a speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers to generate profits for its holders, thereby necessitating registration as a security before being sold. The debate on whether Ethereum should be classified as a security or not holds significant implications for the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF, as securities are subject to stringent regulatory oversight and registration requirements. This stance has garnered attention, as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has refused to deny the possibility of Ethereum being classified as a security, stating that it depends on the facts and the laws of the United States. Diverging Views from Industry Experts While the approval of Ethereum as a security could lead to an ETH ETF approval, it has generated excitement among traders and investors who anticipate a potential price surge akin to the one witnessed after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF. However, issuers of the ETH ETF have expressed skepticism about a positive outcome. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck has indicated that the approval is likely to be rejected, drawing parallels with the lengthy process involved in the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. He stated that regulators typically provide comments on applications, and this process took weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved, but currently, no such signs are evident for Ethereum. Furthermore, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has estimated the odds of spot ether ETFs being approved in May at a mere 35%. While acknowledging that there are reasons for approval, he noted that the signs and sources that previously indicated optimism for the Bitcoin spot ETF approval are lacking in Ethereum\u2019s case. As the debate on whether Ethereum is a security or not gets intense, the cryptocurrency community stays hopeful, eagerly awaiting a decision that could push the price of Ethereum even higher. Traders and investors see the approval as a powerful catalyst that might spark a bullish rally. This is supported by observations of large wallet holders purchasing more ETH, indicating strong confidence in its future. next Will Ethereum Be Classified as Security?

However, the CBN denied issuing directives requiring identification of crypto traders and temporary account freezes.

Binance Faces Scrutiny amid Nigeria\u2019s Naira Crisis Nigeria has been struggling with substantial devaluations of its nationwide currency, the naira. Inflation escalated to an alarming 29.9% by April 2024. Seeking stability, authorities scrutinize cryptocurrency platforms, viewing them as potential destabilizers amidst this financial turmoil. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, has been a focal point of the CBN\u2019s scrutiny. In 2023, the bank raised concerns about $26 billion worth of suspicious financial transactions passing through Binance Nigeria. These transactions allegedly involved unknown sources and users, prompting investigations. Adding fuel to the fire, Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan currently faces allegations of money laundering in Nigeria, according to officials regarding regulations. Meanwhile, another executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who accompanied Gambaryan, evaded custody and currently faces extradition proceedings from Kenya. The CBN previously restricted access to websites facilitating crypto trading, allowing users the unofficial exchange rates for the Nigerian Naira. This move highlights their concerns regarding unregulated channels potentially influencing the currency\u2019s valuation. For the Nigerian crypto community, clear regulations are essential for a secure digital asset landscape. Establishing guidelines promotes legitimacy.

In fact, among those rallying by double-digit percentage figures, PEPE is a little behind. DogWifHat (WIF) grew 20% over the last 24 hours to change hands at $3.37, Floki (FLOKI) added 16% to trade at $0.0001998, while BONK mushroomed a staggering 33% to hit $0.00002701 as of this writing.

Its closest contender Ethereum (ETH), the most commercially important blockchain, added a slight 2% to trade at $3,245. PEPE\u2019s trading chart outlines the rollercoaster ride that many meme coins have been on over the last three months.

Its value is going up, but its Relative Strength Index is 65 and falling, indicating that the latest spate of buying (prompted by the Coinbase announcement) is cooling off. Still, PEPE is not likely to lose much from this downturn in the short-term. The token is currently hovering at a strong psychological support threshold, but should further losses occur, it could find safety at $0.000007. Pepe the Frog, or Slothana the Sloth? Pepe is a massively successful meme coin because, like its rivals Dogecoin, Bonk and DogWifHat, the underlying meme that inspired it has oodles of cultural capital. However, dog coins and Pepe are beginning to feel like meme coins from a different era. Crypto has changed very rapidly over the last few months, thanks largely to pivotal market narratives such as the launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and Bitcoin\u2019s fourth quadrennial halving update last weekend. In short, the jokes around Pepe and the dog coins run the risk of getting stale. Enter Solana\u2019s latest meme coin sensation Slothana ($SLOTH). From the clock on the wall indicating 4:20 to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is clearly cut from a different cloth. Slothana has raised over $15 million in his ICO as traders flocked to the coin hoping to catch some of the early price booms of other Solana meme legends that have pumped recently, like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk. Prepare for a moonshot as we ready the engines of the Slothship! With the launch just around the corner, our slothful crew is gearing up for an epic journey through the crypto cosmos.

This development raises the question: Could this mark the conclusion of the correction? ETH has undergone a pronounced corrective phase over the past few weeks. However, the recent bounce from significant support levels suggests a potential reversal in this trend. Ethereum\u2019s Quick Recovery from 0.382 Fib Support at $2,867 The Ethereum price recently rebounded from the 0.382 Fibonacci support level around $2,867. After an initial bounce, it retraced back to this support level. However, Ethereum experienced a sustained upward trajectory during the subsequent rebound over several days. Ethereum is encountering significant resistance at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around $3,277. Furthermore, notable Fibonacci resistance levels lie at approximately $3,320 and $3,650. It\u2019s important to note that the corrective phase will likely conclude upon surpassing the golden ratio resistance at around $3,650. Breaking out of the parallel descending channel would signal a bullish trend reversal for Ethereum. In such a scenario, Ethereum could potentially target or surpass its previous high of around $4,095. Read More: Ethereum Restaking: What Is It And How Does It Work? Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the daily chart\u2019s EMAs continue to exhibit a golden crossover, indicative of a bullish trend in the short to medium term. Additionally, the bullish crossover of the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) lines and the upward movement of the MACD histogram in recent days further support the bullish outlook. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, providing no indication of bullish or bearish momentum. Ethereum Faces Death Cross on 4-Hour Chart In Ethereum\u2019s 4-hour chart, a death cross materialized recently, solidifying the short-term bearish sentiment. However, if Ethereum sustains its upward momentum and surpasses the 0.382 Fibonacci resistance level around $3,320, it could prompt the EMAs to undergo a golden crossover. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Such a development would signal a return to a bullish trend in the short term. Additionally, current indicators lean towards a bullish outlook. The MACD histogram is on an upward trajectory, accompanied by the bullish crossover of the MACD lines, while the RSI remains in neutral territory. MACD Lines Cross Bearishly on Weekly Chart In Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart, the recent bearish crossover of the MACD lines and the downward trend of the MACD histogram over the past few weeks suggest a prevailing bearish sentiment. Despite Ethereum\u2019s decline of approximately 30.5% from its peak seven weeks ago, the recent bounce from the 0.382 Fibonacci support level around $2,867 has led to a recovery of approximately 15%. The ongoing presence of bullish confirmation from the EMAs and the neutral stance of the RSI indicates a somewhat optimistic outlook for Ethereum at present. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Further upward movement and price recovery for Ethereum seems plausible. However, a significant bullish signal would only manifest if Ethereum surpasses the golden ratio at approximately $3,650. Ethereum Slides 23.7%: Analysis of This Month\u2019s Drop So far this month, Ethereum has experienced a decline of approximately 23.7%, which may mark the extent of its correction. Additionally, the MACD indicators in the monthly chart do not indicate any bearish signals. Rather, the MACD lines continue to maintain a bullish stance, while the MACD histogram shows upward momentum, and the RSI remains within neutral territory. In the medium term, should Ethereum breach the 0.382 Fibonacci support level, the critical golden ratio support is anticipated to be around $2,050. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Chart.

However, if Ethereum were to dip below this level, significant support would be expected to materialize, potentially at the 50-month EMA of around $1,860. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: ETH\u2019s Persistent Downward Trend Against Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s price trend remains bearish, with the cryptocurrency finding notable support at approximately 0.043 BTC. Ethereum is currently within a 3.5% range of this crucial support level. Moreover, the MACD histogram is displaying a downward trend this month.

This introduction delves into how Chainlink\u2019s durability and Toncoin\u2019s AI partnerships measure up in the crypto economy, compared to how BlockDAG sustains but excels by leveraging innovative technology. The analysis evaluates cryptocurrency market performance, highlighting BlockDAG\u2019s advanced tech infrastructure enhanced by futuristic devices like Miner X30, setting it up for a potential 30,000x ROI. With a remarkable $20.1 million already raised in presales and a striking celebration in Las Vegas, coupled with an exciting moonshot keynote teaser, BlockDAG is positioning itself for universal recognition. Analysing Chainlink\u2019s 48% Price Drop & Recovery Chainlink has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of market downturns. Recently, despite a substantial drop from a yearly high of $22.86 to $11.78, representing a 48% decrease, Chainlink managed a robust recovery. On April 13, the price rebounded, reclaiming a long-standing support level at $13.25, defying the initial breakdown predictions. This rebound was supported by a bullish divergence in the RSI indicator, a promising sign of potential upward momentum reminiscent of the previous 370% surge in late 2023. With these technical indicators, investors are keenly watching Chainlink as it hints at another significant price rise, bolstering its position among the top altcoins for 2024. AI Partnerships Propel Toncoin into DeFi Spotlight Toncoin has seen its influence in the DeFi sector skyrocket, with a threefold increase in user activity and a total value locked (TVL) surged to $157.8 million. This growth is spurred by strategic AI-related partnerships and consistent market performance that saw the cryptocurrency hit new all-time highs multiple times last month. Currently trading at $7.00, Toncoin reflects a robust bullish sentiment, driven by a recent 85% price surge. Its ability to consistently outperform market expectations and its entrenched position in the top ten cryptocurrencies make it a formidable player in the digital finance arena.

BlockDAG has achieved a milestone by reaching 10,000-15,000 TPS which has propelled the brand to mint an astounding $20.1 Million in presale funding. The brand\u2019s ingenious architecture enables near real-time transactions and strengthens its potential to mint a gratuity of 30,000X ROI. As BDAG\u2019s price rises from $0.005 to $0.006 reflecting growing investor interest it can be seen that BlockDAG sets up a case for both tech and remarkable returns. As the keynote highlights, BlockDAG\u2019s X30 miner mines up to 600 BDAG and combines high power with practical design, offering a significant 280 GH/s hash rate that triples mining efficiency in a compact form.

And then it\u2019s the mind-blowing keynote teaser that has ignited an avalanche of interest within the crypto community anticipating a keynote display on the moon. Why BlockDAG Holds the Competitive Edge The dissection of the strategies and market performances of Chainlink, Toncoin, and BlockDAG, leads to a realisation that BlockDAG\u2019s innovative approach to merging DAG with blockchain technology positions it as futuristic crypto in the crypto market that has led the brand to amass an overwhelming $20.1 million presale funding.

Yet, utility coins have skyrocketed in value. One needs to look at Binance Coin to see how utility tokens can be remarkable investments in the crypto market. Toncoin and Maker are both utility coins making a name as investment drivers. But how does newcomer Raboo \u2013 now in presale \u2013 stack up against the best utility tokens as an investment vehicle? Toncoin (TON): A Leader Among Utility Tokens in the Crypto Market Toncoin has positioned itself as one of the best utility tokens within the crypto market, driven by its deep integration with the Telegram ecosystem. The strategic decision by Telegram to adopt Toncoin for transactions has spurred significant growth and utility for the token. This integration facilitates a seamless transactional environment where advertisers and content creators can transact using Toncoin directly within the app. The utility of Toncoin extends beyond simple transactions. The token is pivotal in the Telegram network for purchasing unique usernames, creating a vibrant economy around digital identities. The Toncoin blockchain has seen a substantial increase in wallet creations and active transactions, signaling strong prospects for Toncoin adoption. Maker (MKR): Stablecoin\u2019s Governance Token Goes Big Maker (MKR) is another token vying for a spot as one of the best utility tokens in the crypto market. As a governance token, MKR enables holders to participate in the Maker Protocol\u2019s decision-making processes, particularly in risk management and logistics for the Dai stablecoin. This influence is essential since it immediately affects the system\u2019s financial stability and operational directives. Maker also serves a unique economic purpose by being burned or created in reaction to the Maker system\u2019s financial health. For example, when fees are paid, Maker is burned, reducing overall supply and potentially raising value. In contrast, when the Maker ecosystem has a financial shortfall, new Maker tokens can be minted and sold to recapitalize the system, assuring its long-term viability and resilience to bankruptcy. Raboo (RABT): Strategically Capitalizing on the Crypto Market Raboo (RABT) is a vibrant newcomer ready to make substantial inroads into the crypto market. Raboo capitalizes on two of the digital economy\u2019s fastest-growing industries by leveraging its one-of-a-kind blend of AI and meme culture. Its platform is intended to actively involve users rather than simply entertain them, resulting in a dedicated community centered on its cryptocurrency. This strategic strategy enables Raboo to capitalize on trends that prefer interactive and immersive experiences, setting it apart from standard cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, Raboo\u2019s integration of modern technology to evaluate and adapt to industry trends equips it to respond quickly to movements in the crypto landscape, placing it well to capitalize on market growth and investor interest in creative crypto projects. Conclusion: The best utility tokens like Toncoin and Maker are must-haves for any crypto portfolio. But for real growth potential, the Raboo presale is the way to go. The Raboo presale has already gained nearly a million dollars from over 1400 token holders. Raboo is available at $0.0036, and is set to grow 233% during its presale alone, making it one of the hottest coins on the crypto market. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

Among these projects are Avalanche (AVAX), ETFSwap (ETFS), and Stacks (STX). Both Avalanche (AVAX) and Stacks (STX) are open-source, decentralised blockchains built to facilitate easy access to DeFi tools. Given their excellent use cases, the governance tokens of both projects are excellent choices if you are looking to buy into top crypto projects for 2024. However, if you prefer to buy into new crypto projects, then ETFSwap (ETFS) is a solid project to opt for. Wondering what makes ETFSwap (ETFS) special. Let\u2019s give you the details. Avalanche (AVAX): Lightning-Fast Blockchain With Huge Financial Prospects Often tagged as an Ethereum killer, the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain offers three crucial features: scalability, transaction speed, and cost-efficiency. Given its appeal, the project has grown significantly since its testnet was first launched in May 2019. Recently, the Avalanche (AVAX) experienced a surge in the total value locked on the blockchain. During this period, the TVL on the platform was worth over $1.5 billion. This metric is quite telling as it indicates the level of user trust in the Avalanche (AVAX). According to the Binance consensus rating, the Avalanche (AVAX) token is expected to hit $ 41.46 before 2024 runs out. This projection also indicates that the AVAX token has the potential to hit $55 by 2030. With the potential of another bull run on the horizon, user trust should increase, leading to further growth in the price of the AVAX token. Stacks (STX): Reliable Blockchain With Potential For More DeFi Growth Stacks (STX) is a decentralized blockchain that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to connect to Bitcoin. Although the Stacks (STX) blockchain is different from Bitcoin, both platforms are compatible. The STX token holds the distinction of being the pioneer cryptocurrency to receive approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), while also being fully regulated by the agency. As part of its use cases, investors can also stack STX tokens to earn Bitcoin. This has caused belief in the Stacks (STX) project to skyrocketed. As of April 15, 2024, the total value of assets locked on the Stacks blockchain is over $150 million, with the expectation that Stacks (STX) will continue to grow.
