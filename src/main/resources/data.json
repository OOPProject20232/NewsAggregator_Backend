Concurrently, Injective\u2019s INJ faces a slump despite the launch of its 3.0 upgrade, hinting at a potential end to its long bullish streak. Amidst these uncertainties, BlockDAG emerges as a beacon of promise. With its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph technology, the recent Shibuya keynote and release of its moon-based keynote teaser have positioned BlockDAG not just as a competitor but as a potential leader in blockchain technology, suggesting crypto with 30,000x Potential, ready to redefine industry standards. Evaluating the Ethereum Ecosystem Amidst Declining Gas Usage Recently, Ethereum has seen a decline in gas usage and overall activity, signaling a potential slowdown in its ecosystem.

Despite this, Ethereum\u2019s price saw a modest uptick of 5.61%, with trading figures reaching $3,242.75, possibly driven by increased interest from large-scale investors. While this surge in price might seem positive, it could lead to market manipulation and volatility.

The new governance proposal might stabilize the token\u2019s inflation, but predictions remain cautious given the historical performance and ongoing market correction. INJ might continue to see a volatile market position in the near term, complicating forecasts for its recovery and growth.

Allen","article_detailed_content":"It is important to understand the dynamics of the total loan balance, which is responsible for financial management. Whether a user has a mortgage, student loans, auto loans, personal loans, or credit card debt,. The factors that can increase the total loan balance are varied and significant. Understanding Total Loan Balance The calculation of the total loan balance involves considering multiple factors and the exact method can differ depending on the type of loan. A general overview of the calculation of the loan balance is as follows: Principal Amount It is the initial amount that a user has borrowed. The loan balance starts with the principal. Interest Interest is the cost of borrowing money and is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). The lender applies this interest rate to the outstanding principal balance to calculate the amount of interest. The amount of interest decreases with the decrease in principal. Accrued Interest If a creditor has a loan with compound interest, interest is charged on both the principal and the unpaid interest. For example, if interest is charged on daily compounding, the lender is required to calculate a daily interest amount. Additional fees Some loans come with fees, such as organization fees or late payment fees. These fees can increase total balances. Payments made As the payment is made on the loan, the amount of principal gets reduced, and the remaining payments cover the interest and fees. Missed Payments The failure in payments can lead to an increase in additional fees and interest that increases the total loan balances. Loan term It is the length of a time over which a lender is repaying the loan affects total balance. The longer term increases the total interest payments. Factors to leading in Total Loan Balances Interest rates The type of interest rate that is, fixed or variable and the rate directly affects the amount of interest and loan balance. The higher interest rates can substantially increase the cost of loan over time. Loans with higher interest rates The monthly payments on a higher interest rate loan include a higher interest component and leads to lower reduction in principal. It results in the higher loan balance over the life of the loan. Loans with lower interest rates Lower interest rates results in the higher reduction of principal after the monthly payments and it goes towards the reduction of the principal balance. It can result in a lower total loan balance over time. In October 2023, Bankrate study published a report where it stated that the average personal interest in the United States is 11.43%. It is important to note that there are multiple factors that can impact the credit score, including income, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, loan term and others. Credit Score Average Interest Rates 720-850 10.73% \u2013 12.5% 690-719 13.5% \u2013 15.5% 630-689 17.80%- 19.90% 300-629 28.50%-32.00% Source: Bankrate Term of the Loan The duration of the loan can significantly affect the total balance. Short term loans generally come with lower interest costs and higher monthly payments. Long term loans can offer lower monthly payments but can lead to higher high overall interest expenses. Delayed or Missed Payments The failure to make timely payment can result in late fees and penalties. Furthermore, it can increase interest costs, as interest is calculated on the outstanding balance. Loan Refinancing Loan refinancing can reduce the monthly payments as it may increase the total loan balance over the life of the loan. It is important to understand when and how the refinance is beneficial and essential. If a user does not have a strong understanding of finance and the working of a loan, they should consult a financial advisor. Additional Financing It takes out more loans while they still manage their existing debt, which can lead to a snowball effect, increasing their overall financial burden. It is a risky idea to take out a new loan to pay off the existing one. Inflation And Other Economic Factors External economic factors, such as inflation, can affect the real value of a loan. It is important to consider these factors while managing the total loan balance over the years. Impact on loans at fixed interest If a borrower has a loan at a fixed interest rate, their monthly payment remains constant throughout the loan tenure. It provides stability \u2013 as inflation increases, it decreases the real cost of the loan. Stated differently, the fixed payments that a user makes have decrease future purchasing power. Impact on variable interest loans In contrast, variable interest rate loans can also get impacted by inflation. These loans have an interest rate that is tied to a benchmark rate, such as the prime rate. With the increase in inflation, the central bank may increase the benchmark rates to cover it. When there is an increase in benchmark rates, the interest amount on variable rate loan increases, making the loan more expensive. Conclusion: Steps To Manage & Reduce Total Loan Balances There are multiple strategies which can help keep total loan balances under control and prevent any unplanned increases. The strategies include early repayment, debt consolidation, financial planning and budgeting, seeking professional financial advice, and loan forgiveness programs. It is important for a borrower to understand the factors that increase total loan balances for successful financial management. It is important to take a balanced approach and make informed decisions about the rate of interest, loan tenure and repayment strategies. FAQs What are the disadvantages of paying loans early? There can be prepayment penalties in some of the countries and it can also reduce tax benefits. These funds can also be used for other purposes. What are the advantages of making early loan payments? The interest payments can be reduced, which can help in managing debt. What can lead to an increase in total loan balances? It has factors such as interest rates, small payments and delayed payments.","article_summary":"It is important to understand the dynamics of the total loan balance, which is responsible for financial management.

Crypto Industry Concerns With Gensler\u2019s \u201cRegulation by Enforcement\u201d Approach The perception of Gensler\u2019s \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d strategy has long been a source of concern for the cryptocurrency business. Under his direction, the number of SEC enforcement proceedings about cryptocurrency increased to 46 in 2023, double that of 2021, and hit a 10-year high. Executives in the US cryptocurrency sector and a few legislators have charged that Gensler is adopting an oppressive stance. They cite the SEC\u2019s contention that hundreds of cryptocurrencies are securities in cases brought against cryptocurrency companies. However, Gensler has defended his actions, saying there is a lot of fraud and manipulation in the cryptocurrency field and that businesses should \u201ccome into compliance.\u201d Uncertain Future For Gensler\u2019s Tenure The SEC and the cryptocurrency community are at odds over Gensler\u2019s latest post, which may have been intended as a joke. Led by Gensler, the SEC has long been concerned about investor compliance and safety with cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency society monitors Gensler closely to see if his views on the industry shift during his remaining days as SEC chair. Many people wonder whether Gensler will adhere to stringent rules or cooperate with the cryptocurrency sector to find a middle ground.

BlastUP Goes Viral, Raising $4.6 Million in a Few Weeks BlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made waves in the crypto world with its stunning debut, raising $4.6 million in just a few weeks. Many smart investors are rushing to buy BlastUP tokens before their value skyrockets. Holders of BlastUP tokens may benefit from a number of privileges, including participation in an Airdrop, exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest through staking. BlastUP stands out from the crowd in the crypto world. Backed by Blast, the sixth largest blockchain by TVL, it offers genuine utility as a launchpad for DApp ventures. With its motto Grow faster, earn more, BlastUP is dedicated to propelling the success of blockchain startups. Those who join BlastUP now become part of a project poised to become the next big thing. >> Buy BlastUP tokens before they skyrocket << Ethereum Price Overview and Cautiously Optimistic Predictions The price of Ethereum has seen a diverse set of changes recently. Within the last week, the price fell by 12.37%, and the past month saw a decrease of 15.70%. However, looking back six months, the coin has actually increased in value by 95.97%. Currently, Ethereum trades between $2771.40 and $3637.80. Its price movement appears to show a mix of both impulsive and corrective patterns, responding to various market influences. Considering the current trends, Ethereum could go either way. It\u2019s handling a level between major support at $2383.95 and resistance at $4116.75. The long-term perspective is bright, supported by a 95.97% increase in the past six months. However, the short-term outlook is more uncertain, given the recent declines. Market indicators like the RSI and MACD suggest neither strong bullish nor bearish momentum, leaving room for shifts in either direction. Investors should eye the $4116.75 and $4983.15 resistance levels for positive breaks or the $2383.95 and $1517.55 support levels for potential downturns. Solana Current Price Movement Demands Cautious Approach Ahead Solana\u2019s price has seen significant changes. In the past week, Solana\u2019s price dropped by nearly 20%. Over the past month, the decline is sharper at over 31%. However, when looking at the past six months, SOL\u2019s value soared by roughly 453%. It\u2019s now trading between $118.70 and $184.63. Price movements seem more corrective lately, as current trends show a pullback from earlier gains. Solana\u2019s current market position offers mixed signals. The nearest resistance level is at $217.68, suggesting room for growth if momentum increases. However, support at $85.82 must hold to prevent larger drops. Some analysts expect potential upsides, eyeing the second resistance at $283.61. Yet, investors must stay cautious. A fall below the second support level of $19.89 could indicate a deeper trend reversal. Pyth Network (PYTH) Price Snapshot and Future Moves In the past week, PYTH\u2019s value dropped by 24.23%, indicating a downtrend. Over the past month, PYTH decreased by 46.13%, continuing the negative momentum. However, looking back six months, the coin shows a 55.10% increase. PYTH currently fluctuates between $0.44 and $0.82, hinting at uncertainty. The price action lately seems corrective with attempts to stabilize around this range. PYTH\u2019s price could head for the $1.03 resistance if it gains more support. The second resistance at $1.41 might be a target if the momentum continues. However, if the price falls, the $0.27 support level might be tested. With the RSI at 56.06 and Stochastic at 74.50, PYTH appears relatively stable. However, the lack of a strong MACD signal suggests investors might await clearer trends before taking action. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s recent pattern suggests that now might be a good time to look at altcoins for investment opportunities. Among them, ETH, SOL, and PYTH might not offer significant returns in the short term. However, BlastUP stands out with its solid concept and its integration with the Blast ecosystem. That indicates it could have the highest potential moving forward. As the bull run for 2024 gains momentum, BlastUP proves to be an attractive option for those looking to invest in the crypto market.

This achievement, announced on April 16, brings the project one step closer to its goal of 15 million KYC\u2019d users, a requirement for the launch of the project\u2019s mainnet and the traceability of its tokens. Despite this milestone, concerns remain about the value Pi Network can bring its users, as the Pi tokens cannot currently be exchanged for fiat currency on cryptocurrency exchanges. A Unique KYC Approach But An Unclear Path To Utility The Pi team has touted its proprietary KYC solution as a \u201cunique and proprietary approach that combines machine automation and crowdsourced, hyperlocal human verification to accomplish secure, accurate, and efficient KYC.\u201d The team claims that other Web3 services could leverage this approach for identity verification. However, the need for token tradability remains a significant obstacle. According to the business analytics platform AIMultiple, Pi Network \u201ccan not yet exchange their Pi coins with fiat currency on exchanges,\u201d suggesting that the project may not bring \u201cany value to users\u201d at this stage. Conditions For Mainnet Launch & The Concerns Raised The Pi Network team has announced plans to launch an \u201cOpen Network\u201d or mainnet in 2024, provided certain conditions are met. These include developing 100 Pi apps, completing 15 million KYC verifications, and fulfilling various technological, product, business, and legal requirements. AIMultiple analyst Cem Dilmegani expressed skepticism about the project\u2019s potential benefits, stating that Pi Network \u201cworks like a direct selling or affiliate marketing system, promising future rewards to users for bringing in new users.\u201d Dilmegani suggested that the app\u2019s primary purpose is to drive traffic and sell advertising, with the founders being the primary beneficiaries. The analyst also raised concerns about the potential for the token\u2019s value to plummet if a mainnet is launched, as users may rapidly sell their holdings, reducing the token\u2019s value and eliminating the incentive for users to continue logging in and clicking. Pi Network\u2019s Response & Unconventional Approach In response to Cointelegraph\u2019s inquiries, a Pi Network representative acknowledged the project\u2019s \u201cunconventional and novel\u201d approach to blockchain development. The representative argued that the \u201cEnclosed Network period of mainnet\u201d was intentionally chosen to enable utility building and KYC processing before launching the open network. The representative claimed that Pi had accomplished several goals, including creating a mining app, browser, node application, testnet, mainnet, wallet, and developer platform. The representative stated that the delay in launching the open network was to ensure a \u201chealthy launch of the Open Network\u201d and that \u201canything worthwhile takes time and patience\u201d. The Future Remains Uncertain While Pi Network has achieved the significant milestone of 10 million KYC\u2019d users, the project\u2019s lack of token tradability and analysts\u2019 concerns about its potential value proposition raise questions about its long-term viability and adoption.

The executive, Tigran Gambaryan, along with another Binance official, is facing accusations of laundering over $35 million. The case, which has been adjourned until May 2, is being handled by Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption body. Binance CEO Says They Are Working to Resolve Matter During the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai, Binance CEO Richard Teng addressed Gambaryan\u2019s situation, claiming that they are working to deal with the issue. \u201cWhat I can say is we are working very closely with the Nigerian authorities to try to resolve the matter.\u201d Meanwhile, the other executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan serving as a regional manager for Africa, fled Nigeria last month. Anjarwalla and Gambaryan had traveled to Nigeria after the country implemented a ban on several cryptocurrency trading websites. However, upon their arrival on February 26, they were detained by Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In addition to the EFCC case, Nigeria\u2019s tax agency, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), has charged Binance and the executives with tax evasion. The tax evasion case is set to appear before a court on Friday. Binance\u2019s head of regional markets, Vishal Sacheendran, emphasized that the detentions were an isolated incident and unprecedented for the company. However, he declined to comment on the charges against Binance itself. The charges against Binance Holdings Limited and its chief executives include tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering amounting to $35.4 million. Court documents reveal that charges were filed against Binance Holdings Limited, Tigran Gambaryan, and Nadeem Anjarwalla (now at large) on March 28, 2024, before the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja. The charges include engaging in specialized financial business without a valid license, conducting business as a financial institution without authorization, unlawful negotiation of foreign exchange rates, conspiracy to conceal the origin of illicit funds, and money laundering. Additionally, on March 22, the Nigerian government filed another four-count charge against Binance Holdings Limited, Anjarwalla, and Gambaryan, accusing them of offering services to subscribers on their platform without registering with the Federal Inland Revenue Service and failing to pay relevant taxes. Binance Receives Dubai License Binance recently announced that it has obtained a license from Dubai\u2019s regulator, VARA, enabling the platform to cater to retail clients along with qualified and institutional ones. According to Bloomberg, the licensing process involved Binance\u2019s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, relinquishing voting control of the Dubai unit. However, Teng dismissed the report as speculation, emphasizing that the company does not comment on media speculation and maintains confidential relationships with regulators. The European Union\u2019s securities watchdog recently highlighted that \u201ccrypto exchanges largely operate outside of national legal frameworks\u201d and mentioned that Binance claims not to have a headquarters. When asked about Binance\u2019s choice of global headquarters, Teng revealed that the company has shortlisted potential locations but refrained from commenting on specific places or providing a timeline for a definitive decision.

CHP Price Analysis: Will Spring CSOP Supercharge CHP Token Price? At the time of writing CHP token was currently trading at a market price of $0.059 (representing a 24 hour change of +0.10%). A glance at the CHP price chart reveals the seismic impact of the upcoming CSOP Spring \u2013 which has breathed life into struggling price action \u2013 triggering an upside move. This shifts CHP sentiment bullish, with price action now consolidating recent gains atop a higher support level above $0.0575. Increased buy pressure (91% of transactions in the past 24 hours) due to the event announcement could fuel further upside moves \u2013 especially amid a reflected growth in volume. And indeed, with a market cap standing at $16.24m \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that CHP could unlock as much as 5x gains over the coming months ahead.

In a CNBC interview published Thursday, Scaramucci discussed Bitcoin\u2019s nascent stage of adoption. He said the asset will not achieve its marketed role as an inflation hedge or a store of value until its user base surpasses 1 billion. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s going to be way more volatile than people like,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people look at it as a risk-on or risk-off trade until we get to that adoption.\u201d His comments came before Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Friday amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. The drop followed reports of an Israeli missile strike on Iran. Bitcoin Falls in Wake of Reported Missile Strike According to ABC News, Israel launched missiles in a retaliatory strike against Iran early Friday. Iran\u2019s Fars news agency reported hearing three explosions near a military base in Isfahan, a central city. An Iranian official reportedly refuted claims of a missile attack, attributing the explosions to the activation of Iran\u2019s air defense systems. During geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, investors tend to become more cautious and seek safer assets to protect their investments. Traditionally, they turn to assets like gold and government bonds for safety. Scaramucci went on to express optimism regarding Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects. He anticipates factors like the recent Spot ETF launch, the entry of major financial institutions, and the upcoming halving event to potentially propel Bitcoin\u2019s value toward $200,000. Additionally, he dismissed concerns about excessive centralization due to ETFs. Scaramucci argues that current institutional ownership, including BlackRock, represents a relatively small portion of the overall Bitcoin market, less than 10%. Scaramucci Ups Bitcoin Price Prediction Scaramucci\u2019s most recent price prediction for Bitcoin exceeds his prior forecast. Earlier this year, he projected that Bitcoin could surge to $170,000 by mid-to-late 2025, assuming it maintained a price of above $45,000 at the time of the halving. The Bitcoin network undergoes a technical event known as a halving, which serves to decrease the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Scheduled to occur between April 19 and 20, this event reduces the miner reward for verifying transactions by 50%. This halving mechanism will continue until the total number of Bitcoins in circulation reaches its capped supply of 21m.

According to a report by Michael Nadeau, an analyst at The DeFi Report, Ethereum\u2019s Q1 income represents a staggering 200% increase compared to the $123 million profit recorded in Q4 2023. A major contributing factor to this substantial growth was the surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity during the quarter, driving heightened network participation. Ethereum Fee Revenue Reaches $1.17B in Q1 Ethereum\u2019s fee revenue, generated through user transactions, reached a notable milestone of $1.17 billion in Q1, marking a remarkable 155% increase from the same period in 2023 and an 80% upswing from the previous quarter. The amplified network activity, fueled by the surge in DeFi applications, has propelled Ethereum\u2019s average daily transactions in 2024 to surpass last year\u2019s figures. The current average of 1.15 million daily transactions is in close proximity to the peak levels witnessed during Ethereum\u2019s momentous run in 2021. It is worth noting that Ethereum, which was launched in 2015, achieved its first profitable year in 2023, amassing $623 million in revenue. Despite the revenues being significantly lower (75%) than the peak of $9.9 billion attained in 2021, this achievement can be attributed to the transition to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022, resulting in a substantial drop in token incentives paid to miners, now known as validators. Cryptocurrencies to Outperform Other Assets Nadeau said that \u201ccrypto will outperform everything else\u201d in the coming years. He anticipates favorable liquidity conditions for the next few years, driven by the need for refinancing a substantial amount of debt in the United States and the market\u2019s expectation of three rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. These factors are poised to provide a tailwind for risk assets like tech stocks and quality cryptocurrencies. Nadeau identified three additional catalysts that indicate a bullish setup for the crypto market. Firstly, the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is expected to increase interest and accessibility to cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 20, has historically prompted a bull run in the subsequent year. Lastly, Nadeau highlighted the ongoing innovation cycle, which he believes will attract new venture funding and reignite retail interest in crypto as the industry matures. While Bitcoin typically outperforms in the early stages of a bull market due to its widespread recognition, Nadeau noted that Ethereum and altcoins tend to outperform Bitcoin in the later stages of the cycle. Altcoins, which have a clear product market fit, have demonstrated substantial growth in the previous cycles, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance across the entire duration. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network. As reported, data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, show that the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

This movement underpins ongoing volatility as traders and analysts closely monitor trends to update their Bitcoin price prediction. Despite this recent downturn, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market with a robust trading volume of $40.55 billion and a market capitalization nearing $1.19 trillion. Bitcoin Price Prediction The technical analysis for Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows it navigating through a challenging phase. The pivot point for today\u2019s session is at $62,216, a level that Bitcoin struggles to reclaim. Immediate resistance lies significantly higher at $64,606, with further barriers at $67,695 and $70,959 suggesting a steep climb for any potential recovery. Conversely, support levels are established at $59,418, and if this fails, the next cushions are at $56,271 and $53,182. A key indicator of market sentiment, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is at 40, signaling that Bitcoin is potentially oversold but still under considerable selling pressure as it remains below the midline of 50. This suggests that the current bearish trend may persist unless there is a significant shift in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Prediction The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $65,415, further reinforcing the resistance around the $62,200 level. This configuration of the EMA confirms the resistance created by the downward channel, adding a technical obstacle to Bitcoin\u2019s upward mobility. In conclusion, the outlook for Bitcoin is currently bearish below the key pivot of $62,216. Should Bitcoin manage to break above this threshold, it could indicate a shift to a more bullish sentiment. However, as long as the price remains below this level, the path of least resistance appears to be downward, with potential targets located at lower support levels.

Per Kommersant, the officials were named Georgy Satyukov and Dmitry Sokolov, employees at \u201cone of the ministry\u2019s most secret divisions.\u201d The media outlet and major Russian Telegram news channels claimed the duo worked at the Bureau of Special Technical Events. The bureau is allegedly codenamed \u201cDepartment K.\u201d Reports claim the duo received their bribes in crypto over a period from March 19 to October 2021. Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Rocked by Crypto Bribe Allegations Telegram news channels claimed Department K is a secret cyber crime investigation unit. The unit appears to have been investigating the BTC-e crypto exchange. A computer expert named Alexander Vinnik founded BTC-e. Vinnik worked at the firm from 2011 to 2017. He was arrested in Greece in 2017 on fraud and money laundering charges. Media outlets explained that a Singapore-based firm named Wex took over BTC-e business operations. However, questions remained over what should happen regarding BTC-e customer funds. Law enforcers allegedly believe a Wex executive named Alexey Ivanov offered Satyukov and Sokolov Bitcoin and Ethereum coins to \u201cprotect\u201d him from a police probe. Officers reportedly believe Ivanov sent Satyukov and Sokolov a combined total of BTC 2,200 and \u201cmore than ETH 10,000 thousand.\u201d The media outlets said the money \u201cwas transferred through Sokolov to cryptocurrency wallets held by Satyukov.\u201d German authorities arrest two men suspected of espionage for Russia and membership of a terror group planning acts of sabotage against military and industrial sites https://t.co/nKRj62Obb6 \u2014 Bloomberg (@business) April 18, 2024 Officials \u2018Fled Country Fearing Prosecution\u2019 Kommersant said the duo had been arrested \u201cin absentia\u201d after fleeing the country. An unnamed source said they were residing in Dubai, with one living in an apartment in the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world\u2019s tallest building. The media outlet said that investigators had \u201clearned about the alleged corruption in the department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\u201d from Ivanov. The latter was accused of embezzling money from a crypto exchange in 2023. Kommersant said Ivanov had agreed to provide information in a \u201cpre-trial agreement\u201d with the First Deputy Prosecutor-General Anatoly Razinkin. The Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Lodo27 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Satyukov, the media outlet continued, is a former \u201chead of a department that combats IT-related crimes in the credit and financial sector.\u201d The newspaper wrote that, if the duo were guilty, this would be a new record for a bribery case in Russia. The previous \u201cholder\u201d of this \u201crecord\u201d was another interior ministry official, Colonel Dmitry Zakharchenko. The latter was jailed for 13 years in 2019 after taking a bribe worth almost $15 million. \u2018People Think Crypto Transactions Aren\u2019t Traceable. They\u2019re Wrong\u2019 Media commentators said there was \u201ca misconception that bribes or any fraudulent actions that make use of cryptocurrency cannot be tracked\u201d in Russia. As such, many corrupt officials \u201cactively use\u201d crypto. BFM quoted the Co-chairman of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Alexander Treshchev as stating: \u201cThere is great uncertainty about the legal status of cryptocurrency in Russia, even though there are at least 1.5 to 2 million crypto traders in this country. Few of them know anything about whether [crypto trading] is legal. They don\u2019t know what can be done, and what cannot be done.\u201d Russian Government Crypto Chief: Mining Regulation Is Our Priority The Russian government\u2019s crypto working group chairman believes Bitcoin (BTC) mining regulation is now a priority for Moscow.#CryptoNews #newshttps://t.co/Gqdg4vwnZB \u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 9, 2024 Treshchev added: \u201cAs we can clearly see, law enforcement officers have begun to understand what crypto wallets are and how to transfer [coins]. But they are still just as naive as everyone else in that they do not understand that every single transaction is traceable [on blockchain networks].\u201d Russia\u2019s lack of crypto regulation has become a thorn in Moscow\u2019s side. Earlier this year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) downgraded Russia\u2019s compliance rating due to its \u201cinsufficient regulation of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.\u201d Politicians and central bankers have claimed they are close to issuing a draft crypto regulation bill, with industrial miners urging a faster rollout for legislation. Earlier this week, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine announced that a serving lawmaker will stand trial after allegedly trying to bribe a public official with Bitcoin.

Down more than 20% on the month and trading just above $0.50, XRP\u2019s market cap was last around $27.67 billion. That\u2019s nearly $4.5 billion less than USDC\u2019s market cap of just over $33 billion. XRP\u2019s coin ranking it now number 7, with USDC taking the 6th spot. The XRP price dumped hard earlier in the month amid a sharp altcoin sell-off. Geopolitics was the catalyst for the sell-off at the time, but macro headwinds have blocked a full recovery. And XRP\u2019s fortunes could yet worsen, with the cryptocurrency having broken below a key long-term uptrend. XRP Price Prediction \u2013 Here\u2019s Where XRP Is Headed Next XRP\u2019s sharp drop earlier this month saw the cryptocurrency break below an uptrend that had been in play going all the way back to early 2023. Since the break of this trendline, the XRP bears have already hit three major price targets. Those were at $0.4850, $0.46 and $0.43, with bears likely to eye $0.40 next. That target could well get hit is Bitcoin succumbs to a post-halving sell-the-fact reaction, and macro headwinds keep building. The XRP price\u2019s near-term technical outlook is ugly. Source: TradingView XRP Alternative to Consider \u2013 5thScape (5SCAPE) XRP\u2019s near-term technical outlook is ugly. The token may well continue to keep pace with its better-performing rivals for the remainder of 2024. After all, Bitcoin sits at the forefront of global adoption in wake of recent US spot ETF approvals. ETH, while still facing regulatory risk, is a much more dynamic chain and remains the major home of DeFi. Investors looking to take their first steps into the crypto market would likely do better choosing either of these two. Alternatively, for more risk-tolerant investors looking to secure higher gains, a good strategy to consider is presale investing. Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fundraising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token. These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors. Of course, presale investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket. But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains. One project that analysts at Cryptonews think has a good chance of delivering short-term gains is AR/VR innovator 5thScape (5SCAPE). 5thScape (5SCAPE) \u2013 2024\u2019s Most Promising Presale? First-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR/AR project 5thScape (5SCAPE) has already raised over $5 million so far. 5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision. Priced at just $0.00327, a steep discount versus the token\u2019s planned launch price of $0.1, investors who get involved now can lock in paper gains of 200%. Given its total token supply of 5.1 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $16 million. 5th Scape Presale Stage 5 is Now Live!

There is a good chance that it could one day become a $500 million market cap token. That means investors who get in now could potentially bag huge gains. 5thScape runs on the Ethereum network and will make use of the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities. $5SPACE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or card. Eighty percent of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale.

Surpassing previous highs, this data indicates a notable shift towards long-term holding strategies among investors. Defined by specific criteria, including balances exceeding 10 BTC, no outgoing transactions, and exclusion of exchange or miner-associated accounts, these BTC accumulation addresses suggest a strategic pivot towards long-term holding despite market fluctuations. The surge in accumulation signals enduring confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential, positioning it for a re-accumulation phase in the coming months after halving. BTC Accumulation and Post-Halving Predictions Notably, crypto analyst \u2018Rekt Capital\u2019 proposes that Bitcoin\u2019s current correction phase may soon give way to a re-accumulation period post-halving. Historical patterns suggest that a BTC accumulation phase often leads to a period of price consolidation following halving events. #BTC 3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving 1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace Bitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a month In mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% again This\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2BKBQXpPOV \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 17, 2024 Bitcoin\u2019s price typically remains range-bound for approximately five months post-halving, similar to what we observed in previous cycles. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could trade within the high $50k range until around October, reflecting a consolidation phase before potential upward momentum. Bitcoin Price Analysis and Resistance Levels Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading slightly below $64,000, marking a marginal increase of 4.3% within the past 24 hours. Jason Pizzino, a renowned crypto analyst, has offered insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price movements as well, identifying key resistance levels at $67,000, $69,000, and $71,000. He emphasizes the importance of a BTC accumulation and consolidation above $67,000 for sustained bullish momentum. However, Pizzino also warns of potential downside risks if Bitcoin fails to maintain support above the $59,000 to $60,000 range, potentially leading to a correction towards the low to mid $50,000 range or even lower. Pizzino uses historical data to contextualize current market dynamics, drawing parallels to past halving events and aiding investor decision-making. His analysis echoes Rekt Capital\u2019s observations regarding the potential BTC accumulation and price fluctuations following halvings. Recent data also indicates substantial capital outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, notably Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), contributing to the cryptocurrency\u2019s decline. Bitcoin miners\u2019 continuous selling before and after the halving event exerts additional downward pressure on the market.

Bitcoin Moonshot Prediction is Fueled by the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Plan B shared their forecast on X, emphasizing the positive influence of Halvings on BTC\u2019s price. They believe the upcoming Halving will be no different. IMO this bitcoin halving will NOT be different: \u2013 All bitcoin price increase will again be around the halving \u2013 Buying 6m before the halving and selling 18m after the halving (green line) will outperform buy&hold \u2013 BTC > $100k in 2024 \u2013 BTC top > $300k in 2025 pic.twitter.com/lCZjnuoYMO \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) April 17, 2024 Bitcoin halvings occurs every four years, reducing the rate at which new coins are created by half. Plan B\u2019s prediction is based on the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which evaluates Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity by comparing the circulating supply (stock) to the new supply entering the market (flow). According to the S2F model, as the supply of new Bitcoins decreases due to halving events, the scarcity of Bitcoin increases, potentially leading to higher prices. The Bitcoin price is expected to benefit from the increasing scarcity after the halving event and the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, such as via spot Bitcoin ETFs and because of Bitcoin Ordinals. In addition, Plan B shared insight regarding the timing of buying and selling Bitcoin around the halving event. The idea is rooted in the concept that Bitcoin\u2019s price typically rises leading up to and following a halving event due to the reduction in supply. BTC traders tend to capitalize on the anticipated price increase by purchasing Bitcoin just before the halving, while the prediction to sell shortly after the halving, within a timeframe of around \u201c18 minutes,\u201d is based on the notion that the BTC price surges immediately after the halving event. Plan B further explained that this strategy outperforms the conventional \u201cbuy and hold\u201d trade concept, which involves holding onto Bitcoin for a long period regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Agree, bitcoin must take out gold because it will have 2x scarcity/S2F. My \"BTC top > $300k\" is the low end of the $250k-$1m range. Last cycle I took the high end and BTC decided to go low end, let's see how this will work out. \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) April 17, 2024 Plan B also expressed sentiment that Bitcoin will perform better than gold, stating that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity will be twice that of gold after the halving, and the initial $300K price projection is conservative within its estimated range of $250,000 to $1 million. Plan B Bitcoin Price Prediction Aligns With Industry Analysts Plan B\u2019s Bitcoin forecast aligns with other experts in the field. Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, Standard Chartered Bank, and New York best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki are all optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory post-halving. During the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22, Cathie Wood forecasted that BTC\u2019s price could soar to $2.3 million per coin. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Bank raised its year-end forecast to $150,000, projecting a peak of $250,000 in 2025 before it settles around $200,000. Recall that Kiyosaki predicted the Bitcoin price to rise to $100K by June 2024. BITCOIN on fire. The biggest mistake you can make is to procrastinate. Important to start, even if only for $500.

Since then, BlackRock ETF Bitcoin holdings have grown by over 10,200%, amassing 272,550 BTC valued at $16.8 billion. The fund needs about $2.2 billion to close in on Grayscale\u2019s holdings.

Before the conversion, Grayscale held about 620,000 BTC, but its holdings have dropped by over 45% since then. Grayscale\u2019s holdings stand at 308,105 BTC as of writing. IBIT\u2019s impressive attainment has sparked M&A discussions, with some analysts suggesting that an IBIT takeover could be around the corner. While both ETFs have had a slowdown in accumulation and selling patterns in recent weeks, IBIT\u2019s $866 million net inflows on March 13 and GBTC\u2019s $607 million outflows on March 19 (its fourth-largest since inception) suggest that the broader market sentiment might be shifting in favor of BlackRock. Source: Dune Additionally, GBTC\u2019s high trading fee of 1.5% \u2013 the highest among all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers could impact patronage. In contrast, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT charges a modest 0.25% fee, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s ETF offers an even lower fee of 0.19%. Despite IBIT\u2019s notable growth, the spot Bitcoin ETFs market has experienced dwindling net inflows recently. Volatility Amid the Battle for Spot Bitcoin ETF Dominance According to data from Farside Investors, IBIT recorded net inflows of $73.4 million on April 15, lower than the previous day\u2019s inflow of $111.1 million. However, aside from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, the other eight ETFs reported no inflows during that period, which contributed to BlackRock\u2019s growing market share in the Bitcoin ETF segment. The ten-spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $91.8 million between April 12 and April 15. These outflows coincided with a volatile week for Bitcoin, which saw a 9.54% price drop to about $63,000 as of writing. Globally, Bitcoin investment products experienced $110 million in outflow between April 12 and 17, indicating investor \u201chesitancy,\u201d according to CoinShares\u2019 James Butterfill.

These groups essentially aim to help members navigate the crypto landscape \u2013 and enable them to make more informed trading decisions. So, without further ado, let\u2019s take a closer look at the top Patreon communities for digital asset investors and what crypto tips they offer members: 1. TodayTrader \u2013 Overall Best Crypto Patreon Group For those seeking to master crypto trading strategies, look no further than the TodayTrader Patreon group. Helmed by Mark Kelly, a stock trader turned crypto investor, this community offers all members a comprehensive suite of benefits.

Through interactive features like patron-only voting and live trading rooms, members can engage with their peers, exchange ideas, and learn from a collective pool of expertise. Multiple pricing tiers exist, from the $1/month \u201cCrypto Enthusiast\u201d level for those seeking basic access to the all-encompassing $97/month \u201cCrypto Partner\u201d tier. This latter tier unlocks exclusive benefits, including personal setup calls, weekly mastermind sessions, and much more.

TodayTrader has also recently released a crypto course explaining how snipe early entries in new crypto launches. Join the TodayTrader Patreon group 2. Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan \u2013 Popular Crypto Patreon Group for Real-Time Trading Signals Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan is another of the top crypto Patreon groups to consider. Led by Jacob Bury, who happens to have one of the best crypto YouTube channels with over 37,000 subscribers, this group offers trading insights, educational resources, and a network of investors all looking to improve their skills. This group promises regular trading signals for both spot and leverage trading. These signals are crafted by Jacob and allow members to take advantage of market opportunities as soon as they arise. With up to 500 signals per month (for the Crypto Legend tier), members get a steady flow of potential opportunities. Beyond signals, Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan is a group that supports traders of all levels. Newcomers can benefit from the educational resources, including video tutorials, live classrooms, and an e-book created by Jacob himself. Higher membership tiers unlock additional benefits for those seeking exclusivity and early access. From presale whitelisting to insider info on ultra-low-cap projects, members can get in on the ground floor of promising ventures before the masses do. However, what truly sets Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan apart is the sense of community it offers. This Patreon has one of the best crypto Discord groups on our list, where members can engage in lively discussions and build connections with fellow crypto enthusiasts. Finally, Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan caters to diverse needs and budgets with multiple price tiers ranging from $10.50 to $103.50 per month. For that reason, it\u2019s undoubtedly one of the best crypto Patreon groups to subscribe to this year. Join Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan Patreon Group 3. Crypto Gains \u2013 Huge Crypto Patreon Group with Tiers for Every Budget The Crypto Gains Patreon group is another option for new and experienced investors. Led by a charismatic and passionate YouTuber, this group offers real-time alerts, in-depth analysis, and a network of retail investors. Like the two groups discussed above, Crypto Gains offers buy, sell, and take-profit alerts. These alerts provide a glimpse into the creator\u2019s trading activities, allowing members to stay ahead of the curve. But Crypto Gains goes further than trading signals. The community offers educational resources like crypto guides, tutorials, and spreadsheets. From understanding technical analysis to mastering trading strategies, these resources help traders of all experience levels navigate the crypto market effectively. However, what truly sets Crypto Gains apart is the sense of exclusivity it provides. Through the \u201cVIP Lounge\u201d and \u201cStealth Buy Alerts\u201d sections, higher-tier members gain early access to content before it reaches the broader public. This exclusivity offers a potential advantage in a market where timing is everything. Crypto Gains\u2019 pricing tiers range from $1.50/month to $551.50/month, ensuring an option for every budget alongside his free crypto YouTube videos. So, whether it\u2019s the best crypto projects to hold long-term or hidden gems ahead of the next bull cycle, Crypto Gains\u2019 Patreon aims to give its members a leg up in the market.

Led by a top crypto influencer dedicated to simplifying advanced topics, this Patreon community offers a library of short, simple, and easy-to-understand tutorials covering a range of crypto-related topics.

With a focus on accessibility, this community can be joined for just $5 per month \u2013 and for free for those happy to view ads. Although Krypto Cove posts less regularly than the three Patreon groups mentioned above, it is still an excellent resource for those seeking to unlock the potential of the DeFi space. For that reason, Krypto Cove is suitable for all investors, regardless of their experience level. 5. Crypto Seth \u2013 Well-Known YouTuber Offering Crypto Patreon Group Crypto Seth\u2019s Patreon community is all about gaining an edge in the crypto market. This isn\u2019t just another place to get generic content \u2013 it\u2019s an inner circle where members receive real-time alerts on buying, selling, accumulating, and staking opportunities directly from Seth himself. For those unaware, Crypto Seth is a YouTube personality with over 23,000 followers. He posts regular breakdowns on the best altcoins and micro-cap tokens, with many of his videos receiving 20,000+ views. However, Crypto Seth\u2019s Patreon group takes things one step further than his YouTube channel. The group offers private webinars, portfolio breakdowns, cheat sheets, and even Q&A sessions where investors can get personal guidance. With a diverse toolkit of resources and a sense of exclusivity, Crypto Seth\u2019s Patreon is ideal for crypto enthusiasts who want to take their game to a new level. 6. Bitcoin Ben \u2013 Best Free Crypto Patreon Group Rounding off our list of the top Patreon crypto groups is Bitcoin Ben \u2013 a down-to-earth trucker who\u2019s made it his mission to bring cryptocurrencies to the mainstream. His Patreon community is the ideal destination for those looking to level up their crypto game, especially during and after the Bitcoin halving event. What makes Ben\u2019s Patreon special is that it offers a free tier packed with valuable content and resources. But for crypto diehards, the paid tiers unlock an entire universe of perks \u2013 from real-time alerts and analysis to private webinars and Q&As with Ben himself. As Bitcoin continues its volatile path, having a trusted guide like Bitcoin Ben could make all the difference. His passion for simplifying crypto is contagious, and with a laidback and approachable personality, engaging with his content is an enjoyable experience for all. How to Find the Best Crypto Patreon Groups Finding the best crypto Patreon group to join can be a challenging task, since there are hundreds of options to choose from. Here are some strategies to help identify groups that align with your goals and preferences: Leverage the Crypto Network The crypto community is tight-knit, and word-of-mouth can be a powerful tool. Reach out to fellow enthusiasts, traders, or investors on social media and ask for recommendations. A good resource would be the best crypto Twitter accounts, which tend to have a grasp on popular educational resources in the space. Scour Reddit & Discord Following on from the recommendations on Twitter, dive into crypto-focused Reddit threads and Discord servers to find mentions of top-rated Patreon groups. Communities on these platforms tend to openly discuss (and criticize) influential traders and analysts. Look for recurring mentions of specific creators \u2013 this is usually a good sign. Evaluate the Creator\u2019s Reputation Before committing to a Patreon group, research the creator or team behind it. Look for factors such as: Industry experience and expertise Consistent track record of delivering value Transparency and commitment to ethical practices Engagement with the community Responsiveness to feedback Reputable creators often have a strong online presence, whether on Twitter or Instagram, making it easier to assess their value. Consider Your Specific Needs & Goals Unsurprisingly, different Patreon groups cater to various needs and investment styles. Some may focus on technical analysis, while others prioritize uncovering the best meme coins to buy. This is why it\u2019s crucial to identify your goals ahead of time. Are you a seasoned trader seeking an edge, a newcomer looking to learn the basics, or an investor interested solely in low-cap tokens? Here are some factors to consider: Type of content and resources offered (analysis, signals, tutorials, etc.) Level of access and exclusivity (tiers, early releases, private Discord servers) Community engagement and networking opportunities Pricing and value proposition By considering these factors, you\u2019ll be better equipped to sift through the best crypto Patreon groups and find ones that truly resonate with your needs. Why Join Cryptocurrency Patreon Groups? As highlighted in this guide, joining a Patreon crypto group can provide access to top crypto trading strategies, real-time signals, and a wealth of educational materials. But these are just some of the benefits. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at why you may wish to use a crypto Patreon teacher in 2024: Gain an Informational Edge Access to timely and accurate information can be the difference in the crypto market. Crypto Patreon groups offer a direct line to insiders, analysts, and experienced traders who can provide insights that may not be readily available elsewhere. Just like having a knowledgeable guide on a hike through unfamiliar terrain, these groups can help you navigate the crypto market with confidence. Stay Ahead of the Curve As most traders will know, the crypto market moves fast, with new projects and technologies emerging all the time. Patreon groups can act as an early \u201cwarning system,\u201d keeping you informed about the latest developments, risks, and opportunities before they hit the mainstream. For example, the rise of Real World Assets (RWAs) was likely discussed on Patreon long before gaining widespread attention. Considering RWAs have become one of the biggest crypto narratives of the year so far, this highlights the value of being part of a well-established Patreon group. Access Exclusive Opportunities Many top-tier Patreon groups offer their members exclusive access to the best crypto presales, airdrops, and other lucrative opportunities that may be unavailable to the general public. For example, members of the \u201cCrypto Champion\u201d tier on Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan received early access to projects that soared over 1,900% from their presale price. This level of exclusivity can be thought of as having a backstage pass to a concert. You get to experience something truly unique and potentially valuable, while the masses do not. Community & Networking Beyond the informational benefits, crypto Patreon groups serve as communities where like-minded individuals can connect, share ideas, and learn from one another. This peer-to-peer interaction can be invaluable \u2013 especially for those new to the crypto world. Additionally, joining a Patreon group can open up opportunities for direct engagement with industry experts. A great example is the TodayTrader Patreon group, where members of the \u201cCrypto Partner\u201d tier receive weekly mastermind sessions with Mark Kelly. Best Crypto Patreon Groups \u2013 Conclusion To conclude, navigating the crypto market can be daunting, especially for beginners. That\u2019s why joining a reputable and well-established Patreon group is often a wise move. We recommend checking out the TodayTrader Patreon group, which offers many benefits for novice and experienced traders. From regular trading signals to direct engagement with industry experts, this community provides the tools necessary to succeed in crypto.

Like the rest of the market, BCH appears to be tracking market leader Bitcoin, which fell 9% over the last week to trade for around $63,650, at the time of writing. Growing turmoil in the Middle East after an Iranian attack on Israel last weekend prompted the sell-off, which has now slowed down. The two Bitcoins are now in the green again after the last 24 hours added 5% and 7% to BTC and BCH respectively. Investors are stocking up ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s quadrennial halving on Saturday. That\u2019s the day when a software update will halve BTC mining rewards. History suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of a bull run. The previous three halvings have all increased the price of the original cryptocurrency as the halved supply struggled to meet consistent demand. There are some fears, however, that this year the halving may have already been priced in. However, BCH\u2019s price chart for the last three months tells a very different story to its namesake. At the beginning of March, Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies began a rally that peaked by the middle. BCH initially rallied in step with them, but the momentum fell by March 3. On the other end of the chart, BCH rallied from late March to early April, independent of Bitcoin, which remained stagnant over the same period. How Bitcoin Cash Differs to Bitcoin Back in 2017, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which allow the network to process more transactions per second. However, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business. This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations. The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments. The original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value. Betting on Bitcoin? Why Not Gamble With Megadice? The uncertainty around Bitcoin\u2019s halving underscores the volatility of crypto in general. It is still very much a bet, although early projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are a safer bet than others. Still, the crypto world abounds with plenty of useful applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future. One such application is the world of GambleFi. A new ICO for Solana GameFi token Mega Dice (DICE) started this week and it has already raised over $300,000. DICE is the native token for Mega Dice\u2019s Telegram-based crypto casino, with certain games requiring the token to play. It can also be used for staking casino cashback, airdrop prizes, and special NFT benefits. Curious?

WIF Tumbles 31% as Capital Moves to New Solana Meme Coin","author":"Tim Hakki","article_detailed_content":"Popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) posted seven-day depreciation of as much as 50% in 24 hours by the morning of Thursday, April 18, according to data by CoinGecko, although its intraweek losses have since slowed to about 31% as of this writing. Among meme coins, WIF took some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide downturn that has shaved double digit percentages off virtually every leading cryptocurrency in the last week. Leading meme coins fell by comparable amounts this week: sector leader Dogecoin (DOGE) lost 25%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 19.5%, PEPE shed 28%, FLOKI crashed 30% and BONK is down hardest (35%) among the 10 largest funny tokens by market cap. Bitcoin (BTC) led the losses with a 12% drop over the week and trades at just under $62k. The original cryptocurrency was buffeted by a stormy news cycle that began last weekend when Iran attacked Israel in retaliation for a strike in Syria that killed Iranian soldiers. Additionally, volatility has increased a little ahead of Saturday\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, a software update that will halve BTC mining rewards. The halving effectively chokes the new supply of Bitcoin and has many analysts suggesting an imminent bull run as the supply struggles to keep up with fresh institutional demand from the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January. Substantial Bitcoin price drops typically signal a market-wide dip. Today virtually every leading cryptocurrency is posting double-digit losses over the week. Move Over DogWifHat, Solana\u2019s New Star is a Sloth Meme coins have an edge on every other crypto category on Saturday, because Bitcoin\u2019s halving coincidentally falls on April 20, international Doge Day. The Dogecoin community selected Doge Day to commemorate their favorite coin, but given the competition in crypto, many expect canine-related meme coins to get a look-in that day. April 20 is also the day stoners commemorate their favorite hobby, and a new novelty coin on Solana hopes to challenge canine dominance that day. Enter Slothana (SLOTH). From the clock on the wall to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is one of 4/20\u2019s biggest fans. And lo, Slothana, in its eternal wisdom and benevolence, hath decreed: 'Behold, there are but twelve days remaining until the dawn of a new era.' Let us prepare our hearts and minds, for the age of Slothana draws near. May the gains and Lambos be bestowed upon us all.\u2026 \u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 17, 2024 Slothana raised over $10 million in his ICO as traders flocked to the coin hoping to catch some of the early upside potential of other Solana meme legends that have pumped recently, like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk.

In the most recent surge, the Pepe Birthday token (PEPEBDAY) experienced a dramatic 200x increase in price. However, with the price now receding, attention is turning to whether another coin might be poised for a similar explosion. This article will provide an analysis of PEPEBDAY\u2019s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative multi-chain meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time. PEPE BIRTHDAY ENTERED SOL TRENDING AGAIN Today is a very important day for us, our party continues and we are waiting for you!

PEPEBDAY Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin Celebrates PEPE\u2019s First Birthday \u2013 How High Will Pump Go? As price action retreats, Pepe Birthday token is currently trading at a market price of $0.000032 (representing a 24-hour change of -90%). This comes after PEPEBDAY launched at just 9 AM UTC on April 17, in a listing that garnered immediate attention from eagle-eyed DEX traders. Quickfire traction saw PEPEBDAY accelerate +14,000% to hit an all-time high at $0.0076 just 5-hours later \u2013 yet, the sudden gains appear to have been short-lived, with early-bird investors moving quick for a sell-off that has since bled-out most of Yesterday\u2019s big gains. Pepe Birthday token is now left trading at last-stand support above $0.00003 \u2013 with 1,220 holders risking a complete capitulation. And despite the timely launch, and alluringly low $32k market cap \u2013 with buy pressure representing just 35% of transactions over the past hour \u2013 all might be over for this fresh-faced moonshot. For this reason, many astute traders are shifting their attention to a viral meme coin presale. Traders Flock to The Dogeverse: Multichain Crypto Presale Hammers Multi-Million Raise With Dogecoin in focus and bears pressing on, more investors are training their eyes on Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) \u2013 which offers early-bird advantage that could unlock huge gains. The multi-chain meme coin is rapidly gaining traction, raising over $7 million in its ongoing presale. Another fantastic milestone in the books! #DOGEVERSE hits over $7 million! #Cosmo sends a heartfelt thanks to our expanding community! What's next on the horizon \u2013 $7.5M or $8M? pic.twitter.com/yIiutjmR81 \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 18, 2024 DOGEVERSE will operate on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, a multichain feature that supporters will drive prices in 2024.

The world\u2019s two largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether were both threatening breakouts below key psychologically important levels earlier this week. Many traders have become more pessimistic about the near-term outlook given rising macro and geopolitical headwinds ahead of the halving. But Bitcoin has since rebounded to near $64,000 and Ether to near $3,100. In wake of Bitcoin\u2019s strong bounce from $60,000 support, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy now for quick gains.

That\u2019s also evident when looking at futures market. As per coinglass.com, the funding rate paid by traders taking out leveraged Bitcoin long positions recently dipped to multi-month lows. Open interest (i.e. the USD value of outstanding leveraged futures positions) has also declined substantially from recent highs. A less frothy market suggests a more stable foundation from which the Bitcoin price can stage a rebound. That could explain the strength of Thursday\u2019s rally, which has likely caught some off guard. With many altcoins well down from recent highs but the market now rebounding, the potential is there for quick gains. Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Thursday that could be the best crypto to buy now. Best Crypto to Buy Now Injective (INJ) Decentralized trading protocol Injective (INJ) is gaining momentum as the market rebounds and is eyeing a retest of $30 resistance. As per CoinMarketCap, the token was last up around 14% in 24 hours, with a $2.7 billion market cap. Stake $INJ and Chill https://t.co/Uu8gAEkueD \u2014 Injective (@injective) April 17, 2024 No specific catalyst appears behind the cryptos outperformance. However, news that the number of staked INJ tokens continues to rise is a good sign for the protocol. Its modest valuation suggests there remains plenty of room for the crypto to 5 or 10x from here. It could easily be the best crypto to buy now. Gala (GALA) Play-to-earn blockchain gaming platform Gala (GALA) is attempting to continue a rebound from its recent dip. Last at $0.04380, GALA is up 12% in 24 hours and 30% from last week\u2019s sub-$0.033 lows. The GALA price got crushed last week amid the broader market sell-off and after bearish pennant breakout. GALA could be the best crypto to buy now if it can break above this key level. Source: TradingView But if GALA can overcome resistance at $0.050, a swift recovery back to early yearly highs near $0.088 is possible. GALA could well be the best crypto to buy now. Akash Network (AKT) Decentralized computing resource network Akash Network (AKT) is attempting to break out of its recent downtrend. AKT was last trading near $4.0, up 11% in the past 24 hours. The token is still down around 40% from its yearly highs at $6.50, having been battered since late March. But AKT is looking to break out of its recent downtrend. A break above the 21DMA at $4.20 could open the door to a pop higher to resistance-turned-support at $5.0. As AKT eyes a retest of this key level, it could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingView The prospect of quick potential gains means AKT could be the best crypto to buy now. Alternate Investment Strategy to Consider All of the above coins offer investors a great chance of making near-term gains. Indeed, altcoin investing can be very profitable if investors can reliably find undervalued projects and time the market well. However, attempting to time the market comes with a lot of risks, given the high level of volatility in the altcoin market. An alternative strategy that carries less risks relating to market volatility is investing in crypto presales or ICOs. Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fund raising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token. These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors. Of course, presale investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket. But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains. Here are some of the top presales being watched by analysts at Cryptonews. 19 Best Crypto Presale Projects for April 2024 The post Best Crypto to Buy Now April 18 \u2013 Injective, Gala, Akash Network appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"As cryptocurrency prices bounce on Thursday in wake of the bulls putting up a strong defense of the $60,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and $3,000 Ether (ETH) levels a day earlier, investors are hunting for smaller, lesser-known altcoins that could be the best crypto to buy now to deliver quick gains.

Crunchbase data published today reveals that Web3 startups managed to secure just under $1.9 billion in funding across 346 deals in the first quarter of 2024. This marks a significant 58% increase from the previous quarter, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the lingering downward trajectory of overall crypto VC interest. Crypto VC Funding Rises Amid Growing Optimism The latest surge in funding can be attributed to investors with a more long-term perspective on Web3, in contrast to the hype-driven \u201ctourist investors\u201d who were prevalent in recent years. According to Chris Metinko, the author of the report, these investors are currently focusing their attention on the AI sector, indicating a shift in investment strategy. Metinko explains that there is a growing interest in supporting the underlying infrastructure of the decentralized internet, rather than solely focusing on crypto wallets and lenders, which garnered substantial investments during the peak period of 2021 to 2022. Although big funding rounds were relatively rare in Q1, a few notable investments stood out. Exohood Labs, a company merging AI, quantum computing, and blockchain, secured a $112 million seed round at a valuation of $1.4 billion. EigenLabs, an Ether token \u201crestaking\u201d platform, raised $100 million in a Series B led by a16z crypto. Additionally, Freechat, a decentralized social network built on blockchain technology, secured $80 million in a Series A round. These investments, along with others, contributed to the rise in valuations and the emergence of four new Web3 unicorns in Q1. Next Few Quarters Will Be Crucial Despite the recent progress, the future of Web3 remains uncertain. Metinko suggests that the next few quarters will be crucial for determining the industry\u2019s direction. While investors anticipate a bounce-back in investment as the decentralized internet continues to develop, it may take another year for venture capital activity to stabilize after the exuberance of 2021. Factors such as the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the upcoming Bitcoin halving could also impact the market, as the prices of Bitcoin and Ether have been on the rise. A recent example of significant funding in the Web3 space is Monad Labs\u2019 successful round, which secured $225 million led by Paradigm. Monad Labs is a layer-1 blockchain compatible with Ethereum that offers faster transaction processing. This funding round evokes memories of the golden era of crypto funding in 2021-2022 when L1 solutions attracted substantial investments. Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada, has revealed that it has once again achieved $2 billion in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody. Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody expanded by nearly 248% in the second half of 2023. According to analysts at Bernstein Research, crypto funds could reach a staggering $500 billion to $650 billion within the next five years, a significant leap from the current valuation of approximately $50 billion.

Its market capitalization is $1.3 trillion, and it currently commands 54% of the market share. Over the last 24 hours, the BTC price has experienced a 1.2% increase. As for its circulating supply, 19.46 million BTC are in circulation out of a maximum possible supply of 21 million BTC.

If BTC\u2019s price successfully holds its momentum above $64,438, it will fuel a bullish rally to $68,705. If bulls fail to initiate a surge, BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $59,771, which may begin a bearish trend to $53,746. Is Bitcoin A Good Investment? Bitcoin has historically presented the opportunity for significant returns due to its decentralized nature. Bitcoin also holds the potential to act as an asset that does not correlate with the broader market trends, akin to gold. This characteristic suggests that it could move independently of other assets such as stocks. Additionally, the recent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it a good investment option with bright market potential. Recent BTC News/Opinions Blackrock\u2019s IBIT: Blackrock has a Bitcoin fund called the Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This fund, which deals with Bitcoin directly, has increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than 252,011 BTC. This means the fund\u2019s Bitcoin is worth about $18 billion now. There\u2019s a big increase in interest from small investors, more than what Blackrock\u2019s boss thought would happen.

BTC Price Overview The price of Bitcoin had experienced notable peaks and troughs in its value. Despite this volatility, the unique nature of the Bitcoin network and its limited supply of coins has attracted the attention of investors and traders worldwide. The blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial systems. In recent years, Bitcoin has trended upwards, with significant increases in value occurring in 2017 and 2021. This growth has been driven by a variety of factors, including increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment, as well as speculation by investors and traders. Today, Bitcoin is trading at +56654654.6% above its all-time low in July 2010. While the future of Bitcoin\u2019s price remains uncertain, many experts predict that the trend towards increased adoption and acceptance of digital currencies will continue to drive demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC Price history Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price again reached an all-time high in 2021, as values exceeded over 65,000 USD in November 2021. That particular price hike was connected to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States, whilst others in 2021 were due to events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively. Tesla\u2019s announcement in March 2021 that it had acquired 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of the digital coin fueled mass interest. The market was noticeably different by the end of 2022, however, with Bitcoin prices reaching roughly $17194.91 as of January 10, 2023, after another crypto exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy. Large BTC holders \u2013 \u2018whales\u2019 \u2013 are said to make up two percent of anonymous ownership accounts, and own approx 92 percent of BTC. As most people who use cryptocurrency-related services worldwide are retail clients rather than institutional investors, Bitcoin prices are difficult to measure, as movements from one large whale already have a significant impact on this market. More on Bitcoin What is Bitcoin? Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency powered by blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto created the coin to overcome the shortcomings of government-issued currencies without requiring a controlling authority. Bitcoin (BTC) was created out of the need for a cryptography-based e-payment system rather than the conventional trust-based system. Cryptocurrency acts as a store of value and a payment method for any transaction process in the crypto space. It is often dubbed \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s current cryptography is based on an impenetrable algorithm (SHA-256) designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, after the collapse of the SHA-1 algorithm. This algorithm makes it impossible to crack the Bitcoin network. Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, its value has risen dramatically, from less than 0.01 USD in May 2010 to over 67,000 USD in November 2021. Bitcoin is expected to attain newer feats in the coming years as more institutional investors and traders continue to turn to cryptocurrency. What Influences Bitcoin\u2019s Price? The world\u2019s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently taken a substantial hit, dipping below the $25.5K threshold and reaching its lowest value in three months. This downward trend follows a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The news of this legal dispute sparked a swift wave of Bitcoin selling, causing a ripple effect across the majority of other cryptocurrencies. The market strain has escalated as the SEC has expanded its legal pursuits to encompass Coinbase, another key contender in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Crypto experts posit that if Bitcoin can hold its resistance level at $26,000, we might see a bounce back in the coming months. However, if this level is breached, Bitcoin could potentially tumble to its lowest ever value of $20,000. Yet, the experts also caution that the current rise in interest rates and a more stringent monetary policy might hinder Bitcoin from making a significant recovery in the near term. Despite these hurdles, the year 2023 holds promise for Bitcoin advocates who see it as a \u201cdigital safe-haven\u201d or \u201cvirtual gold\u201d. These enthusiasts are confident that Bitcoin can offer investors a substantial hedge or attractive yields during periods of market instability. Bitcoin Challenges Despite its success, Bitcoin has faced several criticisms, especially its energy-hungry mining system. According to an energy consumption tracker developed by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 100 TWh per year, about one-third of the UK\u2019s total energy consumption in 2016. In addition, BTC\u2019s criminality potential has positioned it for more scrutiny, as it has facilitated numerous dark web dealings, such as acquiring illegal weapons, money laundering, etc. The most significant and long-standing challenge of Bitcoin is scalability. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology limits its performance in terms of transaction completion timeframe, with an insufficient capacity of 3-7 TPS. As more transactions are initiated on the network, processing delays will surface. Several proposals have been put forward to nip this concern in the bud, but a favorable long-term fix remains unclear. How do you buy and sell Bitcoin? You can buy and sell Bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms. To purchase Bitcoin, you typically need to create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, fund your account, and place an order to buy Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin\u2019s role in the broader financial system? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen by some as a disruptive force that could challenge traditional financial systems and provide greater financial freedom and autonomy for users. Where to store Bitcoin? The best ways to store Bitcoin include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and software wallets. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure, as they store private keys offline and require physical confirmation of transactions. Paper wallets, which involve printing out private keys and keeping them in a secure location, are also considered secure but require careful handling. Software wallets, which run on computers or mobile devices, are a great option, but more vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks. What drives the value of BTC? Bitcoin\u2019s value is determined by supply and demand factors, such as market sentiment, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor speculation. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, scarcity, and high-security features also contribute to its value in the market. Conclusion Bitcoin has gained the mainstream adoption following massive interest from institutional giants. Some companies, like the Spanish firm Telefonica, now accept Bitcoin. Telefonica even works with a cryptocurrency exchange called Bit2Me to let people pay with Bitcoin. Looking ahead, Bitcoin seems to have a bright future with potential for its price to go up. This prediction is based on Bitcoin\u2019s past prices and current market sentiment. Adding Bitcoin to your investment portfolio could be a good move, but it\u2019s important to do your research and understand the risks before buying Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency","article_summary":"BTC Price Predictions 2024-2033 How much is Bitcoin (BTC) worth?

At the moment of fuss and angst over European immigrants, Mr. Hall will suggest the application of AI facial recognition technology at Kent migrant facilities. This statement forms part of the biannual initiative to improve the process of migrants boarding small boats, with the main goal of assessing individuals for any reported threats. Using facial recognition technology will provide the border officers with a platform through which they will promptly have the terror suspects identified as soon as they disembark in the database, streamlining the process. The technology will help prevent individuals who have been found to present security threats. Challenges at migrant processing centers The suggestion comes from some inefficiency evident at the processing centers, which results in overcrowding at camps like the Manston, where Hall said that the volumes of migrants were released before the thorough check could be conducted. The center, besides, puts Western Jet Foil in Dover to be on the receiving end, especially when there is a surge, and the number of migrants is more than anticipated, which would fragment the screening process and compromise its efficiency. As he did, Hall pointed out that the confinement of prisoners in these places is geographically limited and that there are ethical standards of behavior they should maintain. Closing my tent doesn\u2019t help, whereas if I\u2019m jamming everyone into the same tent, they can stay there only for a day. Additionally, speedy screening methods that do not infringe on people\u2019s basic rights are a dire issue that needs to be addressed now. Implementation of facial recognition technology Implementation of facial recognition technology will soon be part of a trial carried out at Border Force, which is at the Western Jet Foil, a primary vitality intake in Dover. It sets up a process that immediately checks the face of the person in real-time against the integrated database containing the images recorded as suspected to be of terrorists. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, it\u2019ll be in print. However, in my report, I\u2019ll posit that WJF should use facial recognition at the time of boarding so they can screen them off as soon as passengers disembark.\u201d Hall declared it in the LBC interview. These tests will thus be conducted immediately following arrival. They will address a present gap caused by income processing delays and the large numbers of immigrants continuously arriving in Europe. Hall\u2019s plan offers to impart skills to border officials, thereby enabling them to make conscious decisions and do so rapidly, which consequently leads to apprehending suspects on watch lists before they gain access to the country. Balancing security with Humanitarian Concerns Technology being used in this process raises the important issue of wanting to secure the migrants while keeping them humane. Hence, the UK government needs to walk the fine line between taking robust security measures while respecting international human rights standards to come up with the middle option, which appeared to be the core of Hall\u2019s advice. This year, the Home Office has revealed plans to use facial recognition technology while continuing to implement a wider legislative package designed to guide and limit cross-Channel migration. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak frequently emphasizes his intention to put a stop to the boats, and his government closely follows these declarations by introducing appropriate laws. Some of them, like the plan for deportation to Rwanda, prove to be very controversial. Yet despite these movements\u2019 aims and achieving to some extent, they have remained stalled in the final stages of the legislative issues, thus showing the complicated and sometimes conflict-prone policy nature of immigration. More than 6,200 of those crossings were recorded from the start of the year, which was already more than what we had in previous years. The reality of the need for proper border management systems is now more evident than ever. The suggested use of AI-based facial recognition as a surveillance measure at the most critically guarded access points in Kent could become a decisive trend in how the border area of the UK is managed against impending and possibly dangerous intruders. The government\u2019s responses to this system, when it analyzes Hall\u2019s rapport, are doubtful in the context of the use of these technologies, and the smooth fitting of the processes of security deterrence with the ethical and legal concerns is unbeautiful. This acts as a precursor for other nations huddled up with the same security dilemma in the middle of the extreme migration tendencies across the globe.

The plan includes expanding into many international locations and releasing a newly designed stablecoin US dollar-backed product to further extend its role in the global cryptocurrency market while attending to an intriguing challenge of the regulatory framework, especially in the States. Ripple eyes expansion with US dollar-backed stablecoin launch Ripple is setting its aim beyond the United States, but this doesn\u2019t mean it will supersede the markets (95% of its customers are currently international) where it does the bulk of its business around the globe. This strategic shift addresses the slower U.S. market adoption issue, which is primarily caused by the tighter and more extensive regulatory framework. Garlinghouse highlights the dramatic growth in these markets overseas and its importance in driving the company\u2019s globally focused expansion. Expansion becomes the next plan for the company as it may launch the US dollar-backed stablecoin. By adopting a new foreign currency, the bank reacts to the emerging trend of the stablecoin market, which is currently worth $150 billion and is expected to enjoy immense growth. The underlying focus of Garlinghouse\u2019s claim is to integrate traditional banking with cutting-edge crypto technology by creating an instrument of security, regulation, and worldwide access. Boosting XRP\u2019s utility Ripple\u2019s operation lies successively on XRP, the digital asset that acts as a startup\u2019s payment protocol. Garlinghouse was convinced about the prospects of XRP, and he stressed at the same time that the star of Ripple as a brand depended on the widespreadness of its broader solution set. The XRP utilization in global payments and transfers to the advantage of Ripple results in the company\u2019s staying power and relevance in digital currencies. All this constitutes solely a part of Ripple\u2019s plan to have its infrastructure become a formidable system across the world\u2019s financial industry, and that is why efficiently working XRP is being looked after. Navigating regulatory hurdles However, Ripple is grappling with constant regulatory issues, an environmental problem from the United States Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) that forces them to make operational and strategic decisions differently. The still ongoing legal battles show that breaking blockchain and current financial regulation frameworks is not a simple matter to do. Despite this, Garlinghouse remained dedicated to compliance and regulatory engagement. He is convinced that such measures provide much-needed support for XRP\u2019s high growth and would make the cryptocurrency appealing to investors searching for compliant virtual assets. This approach is primarily targeted at maintaining Ripple\u2019s existence and producing power within the financial ecosystem, which is increasing with scrutiny and calls for more regulations. After three years of Garlinghouse\u2019s leadership, Ripple will emphasize harnessing the opportunity the growing global market provides, the forthcoming strategic stablecoin, and the development and implementation of XRP\u2019s utility. Despite the roadblocks created by regulator prostrations, Ripple is prepared to pave the way to deal with these loopholes and set the standard example of compliance and innovations in the cryptocurrency industry. This adaptive strategy is a testament to Ripple\u2019s determination to serve as a pioneer for years to come in the constantly changing financial sector by offering cryptocurrency solutions that are technologically ahead and link traditional financial networks with modernly developed financial structures.","article_summary":"A detailed interview with the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, explained the future-looking growth strategy of the cryptocurrency company within the next three years on FOX Business.

With Rick Osterloh, who was previously an executive at Google, playing the leadership part and the consolidation of the hardware group, the aim of this integration will be to clip the wings of any operational overshadow and fill every shade of innovation. Pichai, the company\u2019s CEO, confidently stated that this integration dwarfs the Android and Chrome bases and will thus boost the aims of making artificial intelligence more broad in the organization. The move not only reflects a change from Google\u2019s previous opinion of separating androids from hardware but also shows a shift in its perspective. This strategic move started at the level of ensuring fair competition for all producers of Android-based phones. Nevertheless, over the present years, Google has decided to employ its Pixel devices as showcases for AI capabilities with the intention of using hardware and software functions together in order to discover new horizons of possibilities. Leading the way in consumer technology innovation In an interview with The Verge, Osterloh noted that the AI technology will be leading all major integration for the phones, and will be shaping the future of mobile technology. The Pixel camera, however, acts as a key example for this purpose, drawing on AI algorithms to improve photos, particularly in low-light conditions and when selecting images. According to Osterloh, deep AI integration is critical, with evidence of how it has completely changed interactions and has influenced the way we perceive services. Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner, also indicated the fact that Google\u2019s aim is not just to rule the AI world as a consumer as well as in a big enterprise sector. AI incorporation to all aspects of its products and services by Google is the crucial step towards its aim to be the top player in AI economy where things are beginning to move. Leadership Restructuring and Prospects for Future One of such changes is the participation of Hiroshi Lockheimer, the head of Google software division having taken up no other title (so far) and is working on the project, which still unrevealed. Nevertheless, while Lockheimer and Osterloh still affirmed that their departures were made on strategic rather than working rival grounds, the rumors of a power struggle had still greatly spread. In addition to merging the AI research and responsibility teams with the consumer-facing divisions, Google is also indicating deeper AI-driven innovation to be a part of their strategy. Although the effect of these organizational changes on consumer products in the present moment is hardly noticeable, its future implication for emerging AI-enabled technologies is evident. This demonstrates that Google\u2019s strategy to unify its software and hardware operations is evidence of the motion of AI towards its own entrant point. This will lead to the creation of a highly interdisciplinary team at Google, and in effect, it will help to accelerate innovations and make the company a market leader in the growing era of technology.

The new model is named VASA-1, and it requires only one portrait style picture and an audio file of voice and fuses them together to make a short video of a talking head with facial expressions, lip syncing, and head movements. The produced head can even sing songs, and that in the voice uploaded at the time of creation. Microsoft VASA-1 is a breakthrough for animation According to Microsoft, the new AI model is still in the research phase, and there are still no plans to release it to the general public, and only Microsoft researchers have access to it. However, the company shared quite a few samples of the demonstrations, which show stunning realism and lip movements that seem to be too lifelike. Source: Microsoft. The demo shows people who look real, as if they were sitting in front of a camera and getting filmed. The movements of the heads are realistic and look quite natural, and the lip movement to match the audio is quite outstanding, provided that there seems very little to be noted anything for not being natural. The overall mouth synchronization is phenomenal. Microsoft said the model was developed to animate virtual characters, and it claimed that all the people shown in the demo are synthetic, as they said, the models were generated from DALL-E, which is the image generator of OpenAI. So we think if it can animate an AI generated model, then obviously there is much more potential in it to animate photos of any real person, which should be more realistic and much easier for it to handle. Use cases of Vasa-1 and its potential misuse Source: Microsoft. If we look at the potential of VASA-1 for practical usage, then on the baseline, it can be used to animate characters in animated movies, which will give characters a more realistic feel with natural facial expressions and head movements. Another use could be in video games, for the very same reason, think of Grand Theft Auto and the like. In the future it may be used for hyper realistic AI generated movies or series where characters can be generated from image generators and could be animated by VASA-1, and the audience may not even feel that the characters are not humans. Along with creative use of the tool, it can also be leveraged to create content for malicious purposes. The potential misuse of VASA-1 could be its utilization for deepfakes, as it will make it easy for anyone involved in deepfake creations to scale up their bad tactics and generate more realistic misguiding content. Remember the robocall scandal involving Biden\u2019s voice to refrain people from voting before a primary election? Now it could be a robovideo after the robocall, and that with very realistic human expressions. The potential risk of misuse is may be the reason that Microsoft has limited its testing to its researchers only. According to Microsoft researchers, the tool can be used for creating misleading and deceivable content for impersonating humans, like some other tools, but they are aiming for positive use applications. Nvidia and Runway AI have also released their models for the same function, but VASA-1 seems far more realistic and a promising candidate. The research paper can be seen here, and Microsoft\u2019s note here.","article_summary":"In a recent white paper, Microsoft introduced a new AI model that produces a talking head that looks and sounds realistic and is generated by only uploading a still photograph and a voice sample.

Similarly, the Polkadot price has faced pressures, unable to breach crucial technical barriers. Contrastingly, BlockDAG emerges prominently, leveraging its innovative mining solutions to redefine cryptocurrency mining. With a whopping $18.1 Million raised in its presale and an additional $2.2 million from miner sales, BlockDAG positions itself as a top crypto for 2024. These advancements, coupled with a recent keynote teaser from the moon, underscore BlockDAG\u2019s potential for a transformative 20,000x ROI, sparking substantial investor interest in this burgeoning sector. Cardano\u2019s Market Dynamics: Observing Whale Movements Recent trends have seen a notable decline in Cardano\u2019s market value, with a 19.8% drop stirring concerns among investors. This downturn prompts a deeper analysis of the activities of Cardano Whales, whose recent behaviours suggest a strategic accumulation of ADA. Observations indicate that these large holders are purchasing substantial amounts of ADA. Despite these purchases potentially marking a price bottom for ADA, the intentions behind these movements remain crucial to understand. The surge in Cardano Whales\u2019 activity, particularly their timing, could signify a strong vote of confidence in Cardano\u2019s future or a temporary strategic play. As Cardano fights to maintain its top-ten status by market cap, the actions of Cardano Whales will be instrumental in shaping its path forward in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. Polkadot\u2019s Struggle Amid Market Uncertainty Polkadot continues to face downward pressure, mirroring the broader crypto market\u2019s reaction to geopolitical tensions. Despite starting the day at $9.05, the Polkadot price couldn\u2019t surpass the 20-day SMA barrier and closed at $8.66 after a 4.31% drop. The subsequent days saw further declines, with Polkadot price breaching crucial support levels and dipping below $7 amid intensified bearish sentiment. As the market fluctuates, Polkadot tests crucial support and resistance levels. If buyers regain strength, the next target could be the $7 resistance marked by the 200-day SMA, with the current price hovering around $6.70. However, failure to surpass this could lead to a fallback to $6.50, highlighting the ongoing tug-of-war between buyers and sellers in determining the future trajectory of the Polkadot price. BlockDAG\u2019s 20,000 ROI Leads the Charge in Crypto Innovation BlockDAG is transforming the cryptocurrency mining landscape through significant advancements in mining technology.

The SNX token is an ERC20 token, and therefore it is compatible with ETH wallets. Besides facilitating activities (specifically to offer collateral) within the Synthetix network, SNX holders can become SNX stakers by staking their SNX coins to earn staking rewards. Who is the Synthetix founder? Synthetix network was launched in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). Its founder is Kain Warwick. Havven (HAV) rebranded to the current Synthetix name a year later, a name it has maintained to date. Warwick is also the founder of Pouncer, a live auction Australian site, and a non-executive director at Blueshyft retail network. What is the Synthetix network? Synthetix Network is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to trade synthetic assets (synths). The protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it provides liquidity for synth tokens so that traders can seamlessly trade them. The platform enables users to issue and trade synthetic assets \u2014 digital assets that represent other real assets like stocks, fiat currencies, commodities, or cryptocurrencies. It also has a staking mechanism that incentivizes users to provide liquidity and maintain the platform. The Synthetix Protocol was originally conceived as Havven back in 2017 by Kain Warwick. Warwick is currently also a Non-Executive Director of blueshyft- a network of over 1200 retail locations around Australia. SNX is a derivative product In a nutshell, synthetic assets are derivative products issued and traded on DeFi protocols. They are similar to traditional derivative products that derive their value from underlying assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currency, commodities, precious metals, bonds, and stocks. The underlying assets are cataloged onto a DeFi protocol like the Synthetix network through tokenization by using smart contracts. Then the tokens, which represent a certificate of ownership of the real-world assets, are issued to investors and traders who can then go ahead and trade the derived assets without holding the real-world assets. Synthetix\u2019s unique features Synthetix network was among the first blockchain protocols to introduce synthetic crypto assets. The synthetic cryptocurrency assets minted via the Synthetix protocol are synths and have an \u2018s\u2019 at the beginning of their names. If the underlying asset is the USD, for example, the synthetic help on Synthetix would appear as sUSD, BTC would appear as sBTC, ETH would appear as sETH, and so on. The community voted the synths for to exist on the Synthetix protocol. The prices of the underlying assets of the synths are tracked using smart contract price delivery protocols known as oracles. This system ensures no slippage or liquidity issues when trading the synths. To mint a synth on the Synthetix network, a user will have to lock up some SNX tokens in a smart contract. How to Stake SNX If you truly want to make money staking SNX, there are a few easy steps involved. First, you need to buy Synthetix and connect to a web3 wallet. Visit Mintr, the portal interface for minting and managing Synths. Connect your web3 wallet to Mintr. Click \u2018Mint\u2019 and choose what type of Synth you want to mint. Remember to maintain the collateralization ratio. Input the number of Synths you want to mint. Click \u2018Mint Now\u2019. Confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. Afterward, your SNX token will automatically be staked. You will now be able to enjoy rewards generated from trading fees. Furthermore, you are also subject to inflation rewards. Conclusion In evaluating SNX\u2019s worth, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader market sentiment and recent trends. Despite intermittent bullish movements, the overall trajectory appears bearish, with indications of downward pressure. Factors such as oversold RSI values and increasing volatility suggest potential further declines. However, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick\u2019s initiative with Infinex highlights ongoing efforts to innovate and simplify DeFi trading, which could impact SNX\u2019s long-term value. Therefore, while current market conditions may advise caution, broader ecosystem developments could play a significant role in shaping SNX\u2019s future trajectory.","article_summary":"SNX Price Prediction 2024-2033 Synthetix is developing a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that is accessible to various platforms.

Discussing the blue collar works, he said, \u201cWe tend to think of the work that blue collar workers do as being relatively routine, relatively straightforward, relatively process-based, relatively easy.\u201d While talking about white collar work or executive work, he added, \u201cConversely, we think of what white collar workers do as requiring subtler faculties \u2014 things like creativity, judgment, empathy.\u201d Source: Highereddive. About the latter one he said, we presume that AI yet has to advance to recreate these functionalities that only the human brain is capable of. He pointed out that in architecture, medicine, law, and accounting, AI does not need to have this quality, at least for solving some of the issues. Susskind pointed out that our ignorance of this very state of things adds up to the AI fallacy, as he calls it. According to him, our misconception of assuming that copying or replicating is the only way how tasks are performed at the human level, and then we try to develop systems using that approach. AI is encroaching on tasks previously assumed out of its reach Some of the tasks that were traditionally considered to be performed by individuals trained by higher education only, are now possible to be completed with AI due to its strong computing power for processing and analysis. So now there are many activities that we considered to be beyond the capabilities of these technologies that are now possible to be overtaken by them. According to Susskind, it is the domain of white collar work. Susskind advises education and training as the only solution to these emerging changes by preparing people for duties that AI models are still not able to perform. Susskind said, \u201cThere are large areas of human activity that lie beyond the reach of even the most capable technologies.\u201d Susskind highlighted that judgment, empathy, and interpersonal communication are some of the sectors still not taken over by AI, and colleges can train people to build such AI systems that can usurp more activities of humans. Higher education professionals are counting on AI\u2019s capability for the transition of the sector. Many panels at the conference were dedicated to this very topic, and the opportunities, threats, and promises that AI offers were at the top of the trends list of higher ed. Grand Canyon College of Education\u2019s dean, Meredith Critchfield, expressed his views that it does not matter how we perceive AI or how our perspective around it changes over time, what will not change will be the foundation of who we are as institutions.

According to a report from Reuters, the company is laying off some members and restructuring some of its team. The major layoffs will affect staff in the company\u2019s real estate and finance departments. The company is axing employees who work in the treasury, business services, and revenue cash operations of the finance department. Google set to cut more jobs amid restructuring moves In an email to staff, the finance chief at Google Ruth Porath wrote that the company is looking to set up growth hubs in locations like Bangalore, Dublin, and Mexico City. This new development is in line with the company\u2019s plans for restructuring. A spokesperson for Google confirmed that the layoffs are not across its global workers and employees affected could apply for internal roles. However, Google failed to disclose the total number of employees that were affected or the teams it is restructuring. In the report, the spokesperson noted that some of the members would be relocated to these key hubs across the globe. The company is set to increase investments in specific areas worldwide, setting up shop in India, Chicago, Atlanta, and some other strategic locations. The report noted that teams across the company had changed since 2023 up till now to increase their efficiency and assign resources to the biggest priorities. Other tech giants announce layoffs This recent development is coming after a few layoffs at the firm earlier this year. Google announced the sack of specific employees including engineering hardware and assistant teams as it looked to focus on building the capacity of its artificial intelligence (AI). Its sister company Alphabet, through its CEO Sundar Pichai, noted that more jobs within Google will be affected. He noted that the firm was looking to create investment capacity, hence the need to make tough choices. Apple announced the layoffs of about 600 employees at the beginning of this month in its self-driving cars and smartwatch screen teams. The layoffs became necessary after the company axed both programs. Amazon Web Services also cut some jobs as a part of its broader efforts to help its parent company. The company laid off more than hundreds of employees across several departments last month.","article_summary":"Industry giant Google has announced a fresh round of layoffs in a bid to cut costs.

Calculated probabilities were calculated by Greg @ learnmeabitcoin.com Block 840,000 is not just another block in the blockchain; it triggers the Bitcoin halving where the block reward is reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, cutting the amount of BTC mined each day in half. You don\u2019t have to be a Princeton economist to understand the impact this will have on the supply and demand dynamics for bitcoin. Beyond the obvious halving of the block reward, a new market has developed around Ordinals which could have a significant impact on what happens to the first block of the halving. Contained within the first block of the halving is an extremely rare \u201cepic sat\u201d. While Ordinals have divided some Bitcoiners on their merit, there is no arguing the impact they have had on Bitcoin.and it raises an important question, could Ordinals cause a blockchain reorg? Through this article we will dig into the basics of a reorg, Ordinals demand, how mining probabilities work, and finally who could pull off a successful reorg. Before we dig into this \u201cepic sat\u201d, let\u2019s build an understanding of what a reorg is. The Bitcoin blockchain is a slow and dumb database that creates blocks of data every 10 minutes or so. It continues working as intended, but occasionally, things get tense. When two miners find blocks nearly simultaneously, it creates a temporary fork in the blockchain. This moment of overlap leads to a brief period of uncertainty. These forks are resolved by the network through the longest chain rule, which is when the fork tip of the blockchain with more proof-of-work (the longest chain or aka more blocks) will be adopted as the valid chain. Orphaned blocks from the shorter chain are not included in the longer one, and the transactions they contain are returned to the mempool to be included in future blocks. This process of one chain becoming longer than the other and becoming the accepted version is known as a reorganization, or reorg. Click the image above to subscribe! Due to the incentive structures built into Bitcoin mining, reorgs are usually resolved as soon as the next block is found and added to the tip of one of the forked chains. This is because finding a block is extremely difficult, and miners are incentivized to work on the longest chain in order to build the next block, and get paid. If they are mining on the short fork, the rest of the network will leave them behind and they will have invalid blocks. The last thing you would want is to build a block that is rejected by the network because you\u2019ve built a block on a chain and are rejected by the network due to the longest chain rule. During the reorg period of a fork, miners build on whichever chain fork hits their node first and try to build a block to get the longest chain. Now don\u2019t get worried about reorgs. They happen every couple of months (on average) and typically involve one or two blocks. These short reorgs are part of the network\u2019s regular operation and quickly resolve without any significant impact on the network and its users. It\u2019s worth noting that deep reorgs that consist of many blocks are rare and, correspondingly, more disruptive. They can be triggered by a network split such as what happened in the Blocksize wars, or a new large miner coming to the network, or an attempt to double-spend transactions (this is very rare). Most Recent Reorgs Source: Learn Me A Bitcoin The Bitcoin protocol and its incentives are designed so that there\u2019s a low likelihood of deep reorgs occurring. Consensus rules and incentives are meant to keep the network stable and secure. For example, most exchanges and payment processors require that a transaction be confirmed by a set number of times\u2014usually six or more\u2014before a transaction can be considered final, thus greatly reducing the chances of it being unwound by a reorg. Small reorgs happen and are mundane and frequent operations within the Bitcoin blockchain, but large reorgs are notable and very irregular. About That Epic Sat You\u2019ve probably heard the buzz about Ordinals, that is \u201ca numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and transferring individual sats\u201d. Some argue that Ordinals are a scam and they have no place in Bitcoin, but here\u2019s the thing, an emerging market is rapidly growing around Ordinals. For now, they are here, and they are getting attention from miners, devs, VC, collectors, scammers, and haters alike. When it comes to Ordinals, they are classified by their \u201crarity\u201d and markets determine value. Ordinals rarity levels: + common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block + uncommon: The first sat of each block + rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period + epic: The first sat of each halving epoch + legendary: The first sat of each cycle + mythic: The first sat of the genesis block If we consider the scenario where all Bitcoin has been mined, which implies that all 21 million bitcoins (or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis) are in circulation, we can calculate the total quantity of each level of Ordinals: Uncommon: There would be a total of 6,929,999 uncommon satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each block. Rare: There would be a total of approximately 3,437 rare satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each difficulty adjustment period. Epic: There would be a total of 32 epic satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each halving epoch. Legendary: There would be approximately 5 legendary satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each cycle (noting a slight approximation due to division). Mythic: There is 1 mythic satoshi, which is the first sat of the genesis block. These figures give an overview of how the rarity classifications would distribute across the total supply of satoshis once all Bitcoin is mined, showcasing the unique and scarce nature of certain satoshis within the Bitcoin network. The Ordinals Market and Beyond Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve seen rapid development in Ordinals technology and markets. Ordinals markets first emerged in Discord back channels where OTC deals were being made, but as demand has grown, digital marketplaces have developed for buying and selling Ordinals. US Based Magisat.io lists various types of Ordinals and has Rare sats listed for a staggering 3.49 BTC. This valuation has led to the creation of additional inventory of Ordinals beyond the category that was first described in the Ordinals documentation. Current Market on Magisat.io for standard Ordinals Stats as of 2-15-2024 This data shows that there is a small but growing demand for Ordinals. You can see the volume for Rare amd Uncommon Ordinals are greater than 26 BTC at the time of writing this. Keep in mind that this is only one marketplace and there are a growing number of OTC deals that are happening between buyers and sellers not to mention demand and business happening in other parts of the world. Looking beyond Ordinals marketplaces we are now seeing Ordinals make their way to legendary auction house Sotheby\u2019s further propelling the phenomenon towards the mainstream. If you look across the Pacific Ocean there is also significant demand for Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which would not be possible without Ordinals. So the demand for Ordinals is real and it is growing, not waning. The last significant item of note that could impact demand for this first block of the halving is the activation of Runes. Runes is another protocol released by the same creator of Ordinals, but the aim of Runes is to make a more efficient token protocol. The kicker on this is that with it going live in the first block of the halving, this alone will cause a significant demand to issue these new tokens as quickly as possible, presumably the first Runes issued will be more valuable than later issued Runes. \u201cYes there will be reorg incentive for block 840,000, but it's not for epic sat -- it's for the 20btc in fees from Casey's Runes.\u201d said Charlie Spears on X. This fee revenue call is speculation but it comes from observation from previous Ordinals and BRC20 activity. Sifting For Sats In Bitcoin, \"dust\" refers to an amount of bitcoin so small that it cannot be spent because the cost of a transaction fee would be higher than the amount itself. The concept of a \"dust limit\" therefore varies depending on the transaction fee and the type of transaction being made. However, there are general guidelines for what is considered dust, based on the type of Bitcoin script or address being used. The dust limit is calculated based on the size of the inputs and outputs that make up a transaction. For a transaction to be relayed by most nodes and mined, its outputs must be above the dust limit. The dust limit for a standard P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) transaction output is commonly considered to be 546 satoshis when using the default minimum relay fee of 1 satoshi per byte, but this can vary depending on the network conditions and the policies of individual nodes. For different script types, the dust limit calculation takes into account the size of the script and therefore can vary: P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash): This is the most common type, and its dust limit is usually around 546 satoshis. P2SH (Pay-to-Script Hash): Outputs for P2SH transactions can have a slightly higher dust limit because the script itself is more complex, requiring more data to be included in a transaction. P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key Hash) and P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script Hash): These SegWit (Segregated Witness) transactions have different weight calculations, leading to lower fees for the same amount of data. Consequently, the dust limit for SegWit transactions can be lower than for traditional P2PKH transactions. For P2WPKH, the dust limit might be closer to 294 satoshis. MultiSig: Transactions involving multiple signatures (MultiSig) have higher dust limits due to the increased data size required to accommodate multiple signatures. The exact dust limit can vary because it depends on the transaction's size and the current fee market. Additionally, changes in Bitcoin's protocol or node policies can affect these thresholds. It's also worth noting that some wallets and services might set their own dust limits based on their operational requirements. Pools Sifting Based on the information above we can examine blocks found by pools to see if pools are actively sifting blocks. What we see is 44% of the network is or has sifted for sats in the past year. We have reason to believe that additional pools are in discussions with sifting technology developers in deploying the tech on their pools, but nothing has been made public at this time. Our findings reveal that a very significant percentage of the mining network sees value in sifting for these sats, otherwise this would be a hobbyist endeavor. When this many big players are participating, you know there is some market dynamics happening. Source: Mempool.space as of 2-12-2024, ranking as of past 6 months Beyond blockchain investigation outlined above, miners are developing new markets of their own in mining irregular transactions for various projects. Most notably is publicluy traded mining pool Marathon who launched a new service called Slipstream which will mine complex transactions such as 1 sat UTXO which is far below the SEGWIT dust threshold of 546 sats. I bring this up because as they are offering this service, you can\u2019t help but assume that Marathon sees or will soon see value in Ordinals of they are willing to invest resources in serving Ordinal or Ordinal adjacent projects with this service. Afterall, the obligation of publicly traded companies is to maximize value for shareholders. We know more than 40% of hashrate is sifting for sats, but what does that really mean in the grand scheme of things. Afterall, we are talking about one specific sat, the epic sat in block 840,000. We know that Ordinals have value according to the very small market, we also know that this sat will likely be sold for more than a single blocks reward, but the big question is who could forcibly win this block? Proof of Work is all about the longest chain and ethics don\u2019t matter when it comes to Bitcoin and the blockchain. The chain is truth, even if you were to reorg. If you are hashing and following consensus and you build a longer chain then you are the victor. Based on the table from the previous section, we can see who the top pools are from the past six months. With that information we can model the probability of these pools forking and causing a reorg of the blockchain in order to win the epic sat but we need to run the numbers. For this we will explore the mining section of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Mining Explained in the Whitepaper Bitcoin mining is a race to find a valid block by solving a cryptographic puzzle, known as proof of work. The difficulty of this puzzle is adjusted by the network so that, on average, a new block is found every 10 minutes, regardless of the total computing power of the network. Now the security of this is where things get interesting. Section 11 of the Bitcoin whitepaper discusses the mathematics behind the security of the blockchain against attackers who try to alter the transaction history. The paper uses a comparison to a gambler's \"ruin problem\" to explain how difficult it is for an attacker to catch up with the rest of the network once they fall behind in the race to add new blocks to the chain. Essentially, if honest nodes control more computational power, the probability that an attacker can catch up decreases rapidly as they fall further behind in the blockchain. The probability that an attacker can catch up becomes almost zero if they do not have a majority of the computational power. The section outlines the process where transactions become more secure as new blocks are added to the blockchain, using a Poisson distribution to model the likelihood of an attacker catching up from being behind the chain tip. This framework provides the basis for understanding how blockchain achieves security through probabilistic means not absolute guarantees. In the Bitcoin whitepaper, the Poisson distribution is used to model the security of mining. It's used to quantify the probability that an attacker can catch up with the honest nodes after being z blocks behind, which is vital when considering the risk of a blockchain reorganization. It offers a statistical view of how likely it is for an attacker, with a certain percentage of the total network hash rate, to rewrite the blockchain history. Converting to C code... #include double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z) { double p = 1.0 - q; double lambda = z * (q / p); double sum = 1.0; int i, k; for (k = 0; k <= z; k++) { double poisson = exp(-lambda); for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) poisson *= lambda / i; sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k)); } return sum; } Who Could Pull This Off? Ordinals introduces a new incentive to reorg. Before Ordinals, the threat of a reorg was focused around a double spend attack, but Ordinals introduced the demand for individual sats, in this case the demand to win a specific block. The question is this, does the value of a single Epic sat or block warrant abandoning the longest chain in hopes of finding a couple quick blocks and winning that epic sat? Pubco mining pools will have a hard time justifying such action to shareholders, it seems negligent. But for private mining pools, they have different incentives and have a bit more freedom in how they pursue revenue. Looking at the top 10 mining pools by their percent of the network, we can model out who could pull off a reorg. One thing of note, the formulas described in the whitepaper only model catching up with the chain tip, however a reorg would require catching up to the tip +1 block, so our values below show that probability. The first thing I noticed was Foundry and Antpool have a higher % probability of pulling off a reorg from 1 block behind than their own % hashrate of the network. How could this be possible? This is because A miner with 30% of the hashrate being 1 block behind and attempting a reorg is at a disadvantage because the rest of the network (70% hashrate) collectively has a higher probability of extending the current longest chain before the miner can catch up and surpass it. However, due to the randomness captured by the Poisson distribution, there's always a non-zero probability that this miner could, through a streak of good luck, mine enough blocks in a row to take over the longest chain, even from one block behind. This is statistically unlikely but becomes possible with higher hashrate percentages and short reorg depths. The next key takeaway is how successful reorgs become less likely for each block they are behind. It is remarkable how Foundry could still reorg from 5 blocks behind. Conclusion The Bitcoin space is weird (always has been) and bitcoin miners are the longest of long when it comes to outlook on Bitcoin. Based on the reorg probability and the potential value from the additional value on the first block of the halving, the probability of a reorg feels likely. If you take the BTC mined from this block, the epic sat, plus the projected amount of fees that will be earned from the release of Runes, bigger pools would be foolish to not try and make a move to win this block. The only real downside of a reorg would be by working on the old chain and NOT winning the reorg, so you would miss out on possibly winning 1-2 blocks by mining on the original longest chain. I do hope for fireworks. It will be legendary to hear the talk tracks from the new Wall Street financial bros trying to explain this. At the end of the day, miners will have to make a decision, that is to simply build on the longest chain or to try and build the longest chain with heavy amounts of luck. They must consider the tradeoffs and pick their poisson.

For more information on services offered, custody products, and the relationship between Unchained and Bitcoin Magazine, please visit our website. There are many different ways to custody bitcoin, and there isn\u2019t one perfect method that suits everyone in all situations. The amount of bitcoin, the frequency it needs to be accessed, and other factors can determine which approach makes the most sense. The resources and security requirements of individual bitcoin holders will differ from those of institutions. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at how the custody strategies for these two groups compare, and then uncover an important truth about the application of multisig. Custody for individuals For typical individuals looking to hold bitcoin in self-custody, there are a number of tools to choose from. Depending on the situation, a simple singlesig wallet could be sufficient, with the option to add modifications such as seed phrase copying or BIP 39 passphrases. We created an article going into detail on various configurations, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Individuals less concerned with making frequent withdrawals, and looking to secure larger amounts for long-term savings, should consider a multisig wallet. Multisig offers threshold security, which can protect users from single points of failure, ensuring that no funds are lost if any one component of the setup is destroyed, misplaced, or stolen. Achieving threshold security is crucial for anyone who wishes to protect a substantial amount of funds.

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. There are a couple of other methods of threshold security besides multisig, but they are less appropriate for the average person. Shamir\u2019s secret share (SSS) is one method that still leads to temporary single points of failure during the initial setup, and during a withdrawal procedure. Multiparty computation (MPC) is another method which is extremely complicated to safely use. You can learn more about these in our article about threshold security models. Multisig can be combined with SSS or MPC to create multi-level thresholds. Multi-level thresholds refers to a threshold on the blockchain level (multisig) as well as a threshold on the key level (SSS or MPC). By combining these concepts, a fundamental threshold of keys serves as the primary security for bitcoin holdings, and each key can have protection from becoming compromised by using a threshold of its own. Despite a more complicated structure, two levels of thresholds offers clear advantages for keeping bitcoin maximally secure. For a sole individual trying to protect their bitcoin, this approach is widely considered unnecessarily complex. However, if the individual enters a collaborative custody partnership with one or more institutional key agents capable of deploying SSS or MPC, this increased layer of security becomes more easily accessible. Lone individuals holding bitcoin have several reasonable options, including single-level threshold security. Multi-level thresholds are unnecessarily complex unless a collaborative partnership is involved. Custody for institutions For companies, governments and other institutions who want to secure a bitcoin treasury, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to employ some of the custody strategies used by typical individuals. If multiple people are responsible for large sums of money, more rigorous controls are necessary. Institutional-grade bitcoin custody requires threshold security as a bare minimum. Multisig, SSS, and MPC are the available choices to meet that requirement. While MPC is by far the most complicated to safely use, and wouldn\u2019t be recommended for individuals, an institution with a team of experts might consider it. However, the extra effort to set up MPC doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a superior option to basic multisig. All three models have trade offs, as discussed in our earlier article comparing them. If an institution wants the highest level of security possible, they should consider using multi-level thresholds. In this arrangement, the foundation is multisig, which allows for a threshold of multiple separate private keys in order to access funds. Several different enterprise key agents can be responsible for each key, minimizing counterparty risk from any single custodian. Additionally, each key agent can apply their own threshold security for the key they are responsible for, by using SSS or MPC. This protects the key from any single officer within the key agent firm. Institutions would be unwise to use a custody model lacking threshold security for their bitcoin treasury. There are several threshold options to choose from, and for the utmost security, they can be combined to form multi-level thresholds. Multisig has a higher security ceiling As you may have noticed from the charts above, there is a distinct difference between the upper security limits of singlesig and multisig. With singlesig, there is only a single key which can have a threshold applied to it, creating a single-level threshold. Multisig can act as a single-level threshold as well, but also travel a step further: it can be the foundation of multi-level thresholds. Therefore, sizable bitcoin holdings that utilize a singlesig foundation rather than a multisig foundation\u2014which can often be observed by examining the address type\u2014have an opportunity for a security upgrade. Multi-level thresholds can unlock a robust multi-institution custody structure that distributes risk across key agents.

Then, 25. Eventually, 12.5. After that, 6.25. And now, 3.125. Four halvings later, we enter the fifth of 33 epochs of Bitcoin. The first 32 epochs, in Bitcoin-terms, last 210,000 blocks, with the 33rd lasting until the heat death of the universe. At 10 minutes per block, on average, that means just about every four years, Bitcoin cuts its supply issuance in half. The specific numerical finite-ness that comes downstream of this mechanism \u2013\u2013 that defines bitcoin\u2019s scarcity in a nearly infinite universe \u2013\u2013 is ultimately irrelevant. Satoshi could have started at a 100 bitcoin block reward and we would have arrived at just about the same place today. But there are some statistical conveniences of starting at 50, such as that 50% of all bitcoin to ever be issued are during the first epoch. And thus, 25% of all bitcoin to ever be issued were issued in the second, and so on, and so forth. Speaking of fourth, the fourth epoch terminates in the fourth month of 2024 at the completion of the fourth halving at block 840,000. A lot happened the fourth time around: El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender, Wall Street\u2019s ETF play, the Taproot-enabling softfork, and even Ordinals. Every new halving brings up the legitimacy of cycle theory, of whether or not supply issuance can be \u201cpriced in\u201d. Each halving is a time of self-reflection for bitcoiners and the culture they curate. Not only is Bitcoin arguably no longer a counter-culture with nation-state and Wall-street adoption (co-option?), but it is no longer a mono-culture. While many things were born during this epoch, it is perhaps the death of the homogenous bitcoiner that is the most apparent. Bitcoin is for anyone; Salvadorans, Larry Fink, Bored Apes, and ESG\u2019ers. Welcome to the Fifth Epoch.

Spending countless hours in solitude, meticulously writing the code that would bring the world its first-ever successful attempt at creating a truly decentralized monetary network, the first of which our species has ever had the privilege of experiencing. The pseudonymous creator\u2019s thought process is one we can\u2019t picture - laying out Bitcoin\u2019s framework and ironing out the innovation that is the network\u2019s distributed ledger, the complex mining process that secures it. And then, one of the most fundamental, yet underappreciated, pieces of Satoshi's design was the pre-coded, fixed supply schedule with a 50% reduction in new issuance that happens quadrennially - the Bitcoin halving. Hard-coded into Bitcoin\u2019s core, this deflationary event called \u201cthe halving\u201d, which enforces the reduction in the supply of the bitcoins being introduced into circulation, is undoubtedly a crucial technical element of the protocol and was a foundational design choice. The creation of a digital currency that would maintain its scarcity and by extension its value, over the long term. A digital currency that would exist beyond the reach of central banking policies and the whims of the hands that control them. That was Satoshi\u2019s idea. And to properly execute this, it had to have a pre-programmed finite supply of 21 million units, with an engineered supply compression mechanism that gradually slows down the rate of issuance of new coins in a four-year cycle. I\u2019m not going to get into too much detail about the Bitcoin halving and its technical aspects, because a lot of brilliant minds have already talked extensively about it, so why reinvent the wheel? Rather, let\u2019s take a few steps back in time. 15 YEARS AGO Let's go back a decade and a half, back to those grueling hours Satoshi Nakamoto must have spent working on Bitcoin. Hunched over, working tirelessly on the code, integrating the halving and all it was meant to represent for the network as a mechanism that ensures the long-term scarcity of this new digital currency. Theoretically, he must have known the profound impact the halving would have on the fiat value of Bitcoin. I mean, considering basic economics and how scarcity inversely correlates with value, it couldn\u2019t have been hard to derive that conclusion. However, is it possible that he could have anticipated the significant cultural influence this pre-programmed technical process would take on? In those early days, the Bitcoin community was a tiny one, comprising merely thousands globally - a few cypherpunks here and there, coders, and a handful of libertarian idealists tinkering in home offices, basements, and dorm rooms, securing the network while earning those block rewards. Unaware, of course, of the frenzy and excitement that would one day surround each approaching halving. And yet, that obscure, humble beginning, was about to birth a cultural phenomenon unlike anything those first few miners nor even Satoshi could have envisioned. With the gradual emergence of Bitcoin into mainstream consciousness over its 15 years of existence, the 4-year hard-coded algorithmic ritual morphed from mere technicalities of a program, into a global celebration - an event that unifies Bitcoiners worldwide, no matter their creed, race, and political ideology and all other superficial ethnocultural and socio-economic classifications we have created - eagerly anticipating, planning parties, that have now come to mark the progression of this monetary revolution. FROM MACRO EVENT TO QUASI-HOLIDAY The once arcane, behind-the-scenes process of miners receiving fewer freshly minted bitcoin, blossomed into a veritable quasi-holiday for Bitcoiners and Cryptography enthusiasts. With its gradual emergence from the fringes, from the darker corners of the internet back in the days when it used to be seen as a tool for hackers, unscrupulous individuals, and bad actors, Bitcoin gained mainstream awareness, enabling the halving to take up a seemingly mystical significance. It became not just a routine supply shock in BTC issuance, but a chance for Bitcoiners around the world to unite in their shared commitment to a monetary protocol that at its foundation, possesses the core principles of decentralization, limited supply, and independence from government manipulation. As we approach the 2024 halving - depending on when you\u2019ll be reading this - it has become curiously impossible to ignore the growing cultural significance of this event. Halving countdowns have now become a recurrent element on social media. Bitcoin and Crypto news platforms, as well as mainstream media outlets and other financial news platforms, have published reports about the halving over the past few months. And then there are events and parties scheduled throughout April 2024. At these events, Bitcoiners will gather for halving-themed parties and events across the globe - from a \"Bit-Rave\" festival in San Salvador to themed happy hours in the pubs of Bedford, UK, and even a lakeside gathering in the California desert. There\u2019s even talks of a bitcoin halving festival being held in Calabar, Nigeria. It's a fair bet that there must be a bunch of other such events either already past, or scheduled to hold within the month somewhere in the world. Though admittedly not all of them are exactly \u201chalving parties\u201d, but, the fact that they are all scheduled for April when we expect the confirmation of the 840,000th block, tells all. CEMENTING SATOSHI\u2019S VISION FOR SCARCITY AND DECENTRALIZATION As we look ahead towards the 2024 halving considering what it has grown to be these past decade-plus, one question comes to mind; will this quadrennial event continue to hold such profound significance? Bitcoin\u2019s identity seems to have formed its base around the halving. It seems to have been ingrained in such a way that Bitcoin, as we know it today, will not be what it is without the event. That much is clear. It creates a reliable, as well as a predictable cadence for Bitcoiners to gather in a shared celebration of the protocol's core ethos. Each iteration reinforces the network's commitment to true digital scarcity, decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance - the very principles that drew early adopters to this monetary revolution in the first place. The very same principles on which Satoshi\u2019s vision - not the flawed BSV fork though - is based. The halving can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy - each supply squeeze is expected to drive up bitcoin\u2019s price, thereby further cementing its place as a store-of-value asset that transcends time. This \u201cprophecy\u201d has enabled analysts, traders, and institutions to develop entire frameworks around the halving\u2019s anticipated impact. Which further emphasizes the point earlier alluded to; that it is ingrained in Bitcoin\u2019s identity. This weaves it into the cultural fabric of the digital currency in a way that transcends its origins as merely a technicality. CONCLUSION As the 2024 Bitcoin halving approaches, its ever enduring significance may lie in its ability to consistently remind Bitcoiners of the network's unwavering principles. In an era marked by rapid technological shifts and widespread social upheaval, the halving's reliability and unchanging nature provides a sense of stability - a guidepost - so to speak - for this movement. The halving serves as a totem, a rallying cry that unites Bitcoiners in their commitment to this monetary revolution, regardless of the fluctuations and disruptions that are unavoidable in the world we live in today. It will remain a quadrennial occurrence that will continue to hold an honored place in Bitcoin culture, reminding us of each passing cycle of the network's unshakable principles and the unstoppable force of Satoshi's infallible creation. This event, this beacon of hope in unsettling times, represents an enduring constant, a touchstone that reinforces the immutable foundations upon which the Bitcoin network is built. As the celebrations surrounding the 2024 halving reach a fever pitch once more, we can be certain that this tradition will remain a vital part of the Bitcoin movement, serving as a guidepost for adherents weathering the storms of a rapidly changing technological, social landscape, geopolitical uncertainties, and global economic maelstrom.

As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same. With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on April 19, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn\u2019t appear to be breaking a sweat. Why\u2019s that? One of the reasons is that Marathon plans to generate alternative streams of revenue utilizing the heat emitted from its bitcoin mining rigs. \u201cBitcoin mining in and of itself does something very efficiently, which is produce heat,\u201d Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201c50% of industrial energy spend is spent to heat things, so imagine if you could capture the heat from Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin miners could get paid for that. That would subsidize their cost of electricity.\u201d During a fireside chat with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, held on April 9, 2024 in Washington, DC, Thiel shared an example of how Marathon plans to utilize the heat its miners produce. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re doing in Nebraska actually is we\u2019re starting to heat greenhouses and do shrimp farming using the heat from Bitcoin mining as a byproduct,\u201d Thiel explained to Senator Lummis. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to start seeing this as a way for people to grow proteins in areas of the disadvantaged world,\u201d he added. Utilizing the heat Marathon\u2019s miners produce is one of the ways in which Thiel is looking to change the perception of Bitcoin mining from something that\u2019s parasitic to something that\u2019s productive. This dovetails well with the fact that Marathon continues to improve its ability to use waste gas as fuel for its miners. Toward the end of 2023, Marathon launched a pilot project in which it mined bitcoin with energy derived solely with landfill methane, a gas that\u2019s 80x more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. The project was a success, according to Thiel. \u201cIt was a proof of concept that showed that you could successfully mine bitcoin using landfill methane gas,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cMining on landfills is very hard, but we were able to prove that you could do it quite successfully.\u201d Thiel expanded on these efforts in his conversation with Senator Lummis, tying together the ideas that Marathon could produce this heat it plans to use while having a positive impact on the environment. \u201cYou generate energy with that by turning it into methane and then converting that into electricity and you create heat with the electricity,\u201d he told Senator Lummis. \u201cIf you can take a waste product, turn it into energy and feed heat back into an industrial process, you do more for the environment than a lot of environmentalists want. And at the same time, your cost to mine bitcoin becomes very small because your energy cost is low.\u201d","article_summary":"In a sit down with Bitcoin Magazine just days before the Halving, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings Fred Thiel articulates his plan to capitalize on the main byproduct of mining bitcoin: heat.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-18T20:17:14Z","category":["business","marathon digital holdings","bitcoin miner","news","bitcoin mining"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"},{"article_title":"BlackRock Releases Bitcoin Education Series","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a series of educational content aimed at explaining Bitcoin, the Bitcoin halving, and its implications, along with insights into its approved spot Bitcoin ETF. \"April is packed with rare events this year, with eyes set on the upcoming bitcoin halving - a unique process that only happens every 4 years,\" said U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, Jay Jacobs. \"Tune in below to learn how this impacts bitcoin's value, and for more about investing in bitcoin ETFs.\" JUST IN: BlackRock releases educational #Bitcoin video. pic.twitter.com/CLaMtQtzDS \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 In a series of four videos, available on BlackRock's official website, the asset manager discusses the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as an investment, addressing common questions and concerns for investors looking to understand and navigate the Bitcoin landscape.

I will not refer to it as a whitepaper, those are real academic documents for adults. In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we\u2019ll have to break down the two pieces involved. The Building Blocks Rijndael\u2019s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate \u201cstaging\u201d transaction to withdraw their funds from the vault. This kicks off a timelock, during which they can at any time send their funds back to the vault or a secure cold storage wallet, and after the timelock the user can freely withdraw the funds to the destination they chose when beginning the withdrawal process. These are the only two ways bitcoin sent to the vault script can be spent. Explaining the full mechanics of how this is accomplished is essentially an article in itself, so I\u2019m going to do something I usually don\u2019t and hand waive this away as \u201cmagic.\u201d (Explained here by Andrew Poelstra) What this \u201cmagic\u201d allows you to do, by creating non-standard Schnorr signatures and with the help of OP_CAT, is to build the transaction the signature check is against on the script stack. This lets you enforce that certain parts of the transaction are exactly as defined ahead of time. It also allows you to put the output from a previous transaction on the stack in the process of building the transaction spending it, meaning you can compare outputs from the spending transaction against outputs from the previous transaction. This allows you to guarantee by comparing them that certain parts of the previous transaction\u2019s outputs match certain parts of the new outputs. I.e. the script, or an amount. So you can \u201ccarry forward\u201d parts of the old outputs into the new ones, and enforce that. Something else you can do with OP_CAT, which did not need Rijndael tinkering and experimenting with to prove, is verify merkle tree branches. Because you can CAT stack items together, and Bitcoin already supports hashing data on the stack, you can slowly build up a merkle tree root from a leaf node with the interior nodes. Hash two pieces together to get one hash, hash that with the pair hash, and so on. Eventually you get the root hash on the stack. You can then compare it with OP_EQUAL against a predefined root hash in the locking script. Unilateral Withdrawal These two building blocks are enough to facilitate a unilateral withdrawal mechanism from a group shared UTXO. A merkle root can be embedded in a transaction using OP_RETURN or another mechanism that commits to a leaf node for each user. The UTXO script can be structured so that any user with a balance can attempt to withdraw it. To do so they would provide the merkle branch committing to the amount they are entitled to, the authorization proof such as a public key to check a signature against, and construct the transaction on the stack to verify the appropriate conditions are met. Similar to Rijndael\u2019s OP_CAT vault, this withdrawal transaction would function as a staging point. User funds would be restricted by a timelock, and they would not be capable of completing the withdrawal until it expires. At any time before the timelock expires, any other user can create a fraud proof to stop the withdrawal and shove funds back into the group UTXO script. They can do this because of OP_CAT\u2019s ability to verify merkle trees. If someone has used a specific merkle branch to withdraw funds from the UTXO before, then that was included in a block somewhere. By constructing a transaction containing the SPV proof of that transaction inside an actual block, which can use OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL to verify the blockheader meets some minimum difficulty, they can prove on the stack that the merkle branch was used before. This allows duplicate withdrawals to be prevented. In addition to this, because you can use the \u201cCAT on the stack\u201d trick to ensure specific pieces of a previous transaction must be included in the next, you can guarantee that the current merkle root is carried forward into the next transaction after a successful withdrawal. You can also guarantee that change from the withdrawal goes back into the group sharing script. This guarantees that after one user withdraws their funds, the change UTXO is locked with a script that allows any remaining user to withdraw, and so on. Any user can unilaterally withdraw their funds at any time in any order, with the guarantee that the remainder of funds are still accessible to the rest of the users. The VM Part Readers should be familiar with the basic idea of BitVM. You can take an arbitrary computation and break it up into each of its constituent pieces and embed them in a large taproot tree, turning that computation into a back and forth challenge/response game. This allows you to lock bitcoin with more complicated conditions than is directly supported by bitcoin script itself. The only real shortcoming is the need to craft a massive amount of pre-signed transactions to facilitate this. The requirement to use pre-signed transactions is so that in the challenge/response dynamic, you can guarantee that coins are spent back into the large taproot tree encoding it unless an exit condition one way or the other is reached. OP_CAT and the ability to \u201ccarry forward\u201d data from previous transactions allows you to guarantee that without needing pre-signed transactions. So not only does this scheme allow any user to unilaterally exit on their own, it also allows locking conditions supported by a second layer that are not supported by Bitcoin script to actually be enforced in the withdrawal process. I.e. if some coins were encumbered by a smart contract the base layer doesn\u2019t understand, and then withdrawn from the second layer, those more complicated conditions could still be settled correctly on the base layer as the coins are withdrawn. The Missing Piece One thing that OP_CAT does not enable is updating a merkle tree root representing user balances off-chain verifiably. It can enable an already committed state to facilitate unilateral withdrawals, but that is because a whole section of the tree is actually put on-chain and verified. To update that root off-chain by definition means you are not putting the data on-chain. This represents a problem. There is no way with just CAT to efficiently verify that all changes to the merkle tree were authorized properly by the relevant users. Someone(s) has to be trusted, and by the nature of things capable of spending the UTXO however and wherever they want, to efficiently replace an old state root with a new one to represent all off-chain balance changes. A new opcode in addition to OP_CAT, such as OP_ZKVERIFY, would be needed to do this in a trustless manner. This wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world without OP_ZKVERIFY though. The entity updating the merkle root for off-chain transfers could be an n-of-n multisig, with 100% of the participants required to sign off on any root changes. This boils down to the same trust model as BitVM based pegs, where as long as a single honest participant exists, no one's funds can be stolen. It is a stark improvement over existing BitVM designs however when it comes to the withdrawal process. In BitVM pegs, users do not have a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. Peg operators must be trusted to fulfill user withdrawals, knowing that they can claim back funds they have spent doing so relatively trustlessly from the BitVM peg. While the incentives of this are very solid, it still does require users essentially getting permission from someone else to exit the system, they cannot do it on their own. With CatVM, users can claim back their funds unilaterally, and an operator is not required to front their own liquidity to process withdrawals. Wrapping Up Overall, the design is incomplete in terms of construction. This is not something I would call a Layer 2 in and of itself. It is the core of one, the mechanism and structure for how funds are locked into a Layer 2, and the process for how users can withdraw their funds. It definitely has a lot of flexibility and usefulness to it. In the worst case scenario, users do not need anyone\u2019s permission to safely claim their funds back on-chain. It also allows more flexible programmability of funds, while still carrying the enforcement of those conditions to the base layer in the event of worst case unilateral exits. If one day we do eventually get something like OP_ZKVERIFY, the off-chain state progression can become an actually trustless process. I don\u2019t expect any concrete demos in the near future, but it definitely is a sound idea in my opinion, and something worth considering. It also shows that the wizards are doing a little more than just pumping stupid jpegs.","article_summary":"A breakdown of Taproot Wizard's recent CatVM proposal, what it actually is, and what it could be useful for.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-the-heck-is-catvm","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T22:30:00Z","category":["op_cat","opinion","catvm","technical"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-the-heck-is-catvm","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Breaking Down The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Implications and Predictions for Bitcoin Miners","author":"El Sultan Bitcoin","article_detailed_content":"The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal occurrence, is scheduled for April, 19 2024. This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining. Economic Outlook and Market Predictions After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network. Luxor\u2019s Hashrate Index Research Team projects about 3-7% of Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate could go offline if Bitcoin\u2019s price maintains its current level. However, if prices fall, up to 16% of the hashrate could become economically unviable, depending on the trajectory of Bitcoin prices and transaction fees post-halving. The hashrate, a critical security measure for Bitcoin, might adjust along with difficulty levels to align with the new economic realities. Luxor\u2019s analysis suggests different scenarios where the network's hashrate could end up ranging from 639 EH/s to 674 EH/s by year's end, reflecting adjustments to the new earning potential post-halving. ASIC Pricing and Breakeven Points Post-halving, the profitability of different ASIC models will become crucial as the mining reward drops. Lower rewards mean that only the most efficient machines will be able to operate profitably if the price of Bitcoin does not see a significant increase. For instance, according to Luxor\u2019s projections, next-generation ASICs like the S19 XP and M30S++ might have breakeven power costs ranging from $0.07/kWh to $0.15/kWh, depending on post-Halving hashprice. This shift in profitability will likely lead to a repricing of ASIC machines. Historical data suggests that ASIC prices are highly correlated with hashprice; therefore, the anticipated reduction in hashprice will prompt a downward adjustment in ASIC values. This will particularly impact older and less efficient models, potentially accelerating their phase-out from the market. The Role of Custom ASIC Firmware Post-Halving To combat reduced profitability, miners are increasingly turning to custom ASIC firmware to improve the efficiency of their hardware. Firmware like LuxOS and BraiinsOS can enhance the performance of machines by optimizing their power usage and hashrate output, thus lowering the breakeven point for electricity costs. For example, underclocking an S19 with custom firmware could extend its operational viability by reducing its power draw, thereby maintaining profitability even at lower hashprices. Public miners, in particular, are adopting custom firmware to boost the efficiency of their fleets. Companies like CleanSpark and Marathon have reported using custom solutions to enhance their operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to grow as more miners seek to maximize their output and minimize costs in the face of decreasing block rewards. 2024 Bitcoin Halving and Beyond The 2024 Bitcoin Halving is set to reshape the mining landscape significantly, just as previous halvings have. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, the event will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities. Miners who plan strategically, taking into account both economic forecasts and operational efficiencies, will be better positioned to navigate the post-halving environment. For those in the Bitcoin mining industry, staying informed and adaptable will be key to leveraging the halving event as an opportunity rather than a setback. With the right preparations, particularly in ASIC management and firmware optimization, miners can continue to thrive even under tightened economic conditions.

NEW: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs to start trading by 30th April and could bring in $25 billion: Reports Just a matter of time 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Y1Xo4JVrO7 \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently approved several fund managers to offer spot bitcoin ETFs. Following this, OSL, a crypto infrastructure provider for some approved fund managers, stated that the bitcoin ETFs are aiming to go live as early as late April. Markus Thielen, founder of research firm 10x, also stated that the Bitcoin ETFs could start trading by April 30th. The launch timeline will depend on finalizing details with regulators. Once listed, analysts predict the accessible funds could attract significant capital inflows. Singapore-based Matrixport expects mainland Chinese investors to pour up to $25 billion into Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETFs via the Southbound Stock Connect program. Thielen echoed this sentiment, stating the ETFs could yield $25 billion if fully accessible to Chinese investors. However, he noted that Chinese participation may take at least six months due to evolving regulations. Nonetheless, the ETFs mark a milestone for Bitcoin adoption in Asia. They provide regulated exposure to bitcoin, opening the assets to a broader range of investors. The funds' unique in-kind redemption feature also makes them competitive globally. This allows swapping bitcoin directly for ETF shares, increasing efficiency. Click the image to learn more. By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub. The city is moving swiftly to license Bitcoin companies and products amid growing demand. With bitcoin's next halving just days away, the ETF launch timing is opportune. Many predict the supply shock event will propel Bitcoin to new highs, benefiting linked investment vehicles. If successful, Hong Kong's spot ETFs could prompt other Asian jurisdictions to follow suit. The domino effect would boost regional participation and maturity for the Bitcoin market.","article_summary":"Hong Kong's hotly anticipated spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to launch by end of April, potentially yielding up to $25 billion in capital inflows according to industry analysts.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-to-trade-by-april-30th-reports","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T21:48:34Z","category":["china","business","news","spot bitcoin etf","hong kong"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-to-trade-by-april-30th-reports","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU1NjA5NTEzNjY3/hong-kong-securities-regulator-promises-to-regulate-crypto-investment-funds.jpg"},{"article_title":"Rights, Reason, Revolution: In DC at the Bitcoin Policy Summit","author":"Stephen Pollock","article_detailed_content":"In the whirlwind of April 2024, with Bitcoin ETFs dominating headlines and halving celebration planning in full swing, the Bitcoin Policy Summit emerged as a pivotal moment for policymakers, industry leaders, and human rights champions. Against the backdrop of global discussions on Bitcoin regulation\u2014and coinciding with a solar eclipse\u2014the summit aimed to be a beacon of reason and a catalyst for action in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. The Bitcoin Policy Summit boasted a remarkable turnout, with more than 45,000 individuals tuning into the livestream. Among the 500+ in-person attendees were representatives from 26 universities, 75 government officials, and 250 public policy professionals. The summit also garnered attention from over a dozen media outlets. Notably, elected leaders from both major political parties were present, alongside representatives from prominent organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Department, Department of Commerce, Treasury Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The summit, with its diverse mix of voices and perspectives, shed light on the pressing need for smart and informed decision-making in the realm of digital asset policy. While Bitcoin symbolizes financial freedom and empowerment, it also brings its fair share of challenges, from concerns about money laundering to energy usage. The summit tackled these complex issues head-on, offering insights into the multifaceted world of Bitcoin as it relates to mining, geopolitics, the future of money, and human rights. The Bitcoin Policy Summit witnessed a significant turnout of policymakers committed to safeguarding the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and addressing its associated challenges. Figures such as Senators Marsha Blackburn, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cynthia Lummis, alongside House members Wiley Nickel, Tom Emmer, and Patrick McHenry, lent their expertise and bipartisan support to the discussions. Their active involvement not only enriched the conversation but also signaled a united effort to ensure that digital asset policies foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold transparency and accountability. One of the most striking features of the summit was its focus on the intersection of Bitcoin and human rights, with speakers like Felix Maradiaga, 2024 Nobel Prize Nominee and prominent human rights advocate from Nicaragua; Anna Chekhovich, financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) founded by Alexei Navalny; Roya Mahboob, Afghan entrepreneur and women's rights advocate; and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian human rights activist. Their combined emphasis on Bitcoin\u2019s critical role in defending human rights and freedom of expression in the face of dictators and oppressive regimes shed light on broader roles for digital assets that many in the United States may not have previously considered. Furthermore, the summit stressed the importance of taking a global perspective on digital asset regulation to protect human rights. In a world where digital assets know no borders, fragmented regulatory approaches risk creating loopholes and undermining financial integrity. Human rights activists stressed the need to protect privacy, free speech, and equal access to financial services for all, regardless of where they are. The conference hall buzzed with anticipation as attendees dispersed into three specialized rooms for afternoon deep dive tracks: Mining & Energy, Geopolitics, and Future of Money. Concurrent programming featured keynotes such as \u201cA Climate Scientist\u2019s Perspective on Bitcoin\u201d by Margot Paez, BPI fellow and PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. Fireside chats and panels included \"Bitcoin & Financial Inclusion\" with Chastity Murphy from the U.S. Treasury, and \"Countering Digital Authoritarianism\" featuring renowned writer Roger Huang, author of \u2018Bitcoin and China\u2019, and Jorge Jrsaissati, President of the Organization for Economic Inclusion. One of my personal highlights from the Bitcoin Policy Summit was engaging in a fireside chat with Senator Marsha Blackburn from my home state of Tennessee. We explored the connection between Bitcoin and her advocacy for consumer rights and privacy. Additionally, we discussed Tennessee's growing prominence as a Bitcoin hub and her stance on CBDCs (spoiler: she\u2019s not a fan). It's truly inspiring to witness elected leaders championing both monetary and digital freedoms, reinforcing their commitment to safeguarding these fundamental rights. Another standout moment occurred during a post-summit dinner with Felix Maradiaga and his wife, Berta Valle. Felix, who endured four years of imprisonment under a Nicaraguan dictator, shared firsthand accounts of political dissent and activism. These experiences underscore the importance of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network, providing resilience against oppression. The 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington D.C. served as a crucial platform for educating policymakers and advocating for Bitcoin's role in shaping a freer and more sustainable financial future. Through candid dialogue, diverse perspectives, and collaborative efforts across sectors, participants witnessed the transformative potential of Bitcoin to advance global human rights, bolster national security, and accelerate renewable energy adoption. As we reflect on the insights garnered from the summit, let's seize this pivotal moment to shape a regulatory landscape that not only fosters innovation and economic growth but also champions human dignity, justice, and liberty.

Bitcoin tumbled below $60,000 over the weekend, fueled by conflict between Iran and Israel, sparking fears that escalation could lead to Western involvement in a war in the Middle East\u2014an all too common occurrence in the 21st century that would lead to increased inflationary pressures and disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets. While skeptics were quick to mock bitcoin\u2019s near instantaneous selloff in reaction to the news of conflict, ironically bitcoin was one of the only global asset open for trading on the weekend, with equities, commodities, and bond strategists alike turning their eyes to the bitcoin chart in an attempt to assess what the damage might be to global markets upon the Sunday night trading open. Turning away from geopolitics, this brief article will take a look at the latest in on-chain spending behavior and Bitcoin derivative markets, to analyze whether the current dip from the highs of $73,000 is typical of a standard bull market correction or more so a cyclical peak. Many preconceived notions of a typical Bitcoin cycle have already been shattered with new highs being broken before the upcoming halving taking place on block 840,000. So let's evaluate and take a look at where we are, and how these conditions and investor behavior also inform what might come next. We\u2019ll be looking at both on-chain data, to analyze the actions of incumbent Bitcoin hodlers and new market entrants alike, before taking a look at the derivatives market to gauge whether there is anything worrisome in regards to the leverage currently present in the market. Unchained is the Official Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine. Click here to learn more about Unchained's bitcoin financial services and receive exclusive discounts on Unchained vault, Signature and IRA. First, we\u2019ll take a look at a metric called the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, coined and created by TXMC, which compares near-term spending behavior to the yearly average, as a means of detecting overheated and undervalued markets. A brief look at this signals that the bull market is well underway, and may have even peaked. The exact calculation of the metric, for those curious, is the ratio of two daily moving averages (30, 365) of Value Days Destroyed (Coin Days Destroyed * Price), then adjusted for supply inflation to account for changes in spender behavior over time. We can attribute approximately one third of the spending as a simple transfer of coins from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to new ETF participants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. However, the raw data is just that\u2014the raw data, and we can see there has been a significant amount of spending that\u2019s occurred with the push to new highs. A closer look at the metric, however, shows that this spending activity is cooling off, and there is historical precedent for new highs in the market in both the 2017 and 2021 cycle - this is merely a data point to keep in mind. Next, taking a look at the interplay between HODLers and new entrants, viewed through the lens of short-term and long-term holders, we can see that during a typical bull market, revisits to the cost basis of short-term holders are not only typical but also quite healthy. Additionally, the ability for this approximate price level to serve as support is a characteristic of bull markets, with the inverse being true in a bear market, where this psychological level of average short-term holder price (cost basis) often serves as ironclad psychological and technical resistance. As for where that level is today, approximately $58,500, which means that by no means is a visit to this level a guarantee or certainty, but rather it is something that is perfectly in the norm of expected activity in a bull market. Turning our attention to the derivatives market, there has been a healthy flush of leverage and speculative froth across the market. Perpetual futures open in bitcoin terms are near the lowest levels seen since 2022, while futures have been trading at a slight discount to spot markets since the weekend flush lower. While there is no law or guarantee that this brings about higher prices immediately, similar positioning in the past has fostered the conditions for price appreciation, and when compared to the top-heavy speculative froth of a speculative premium in futures market pricing observed over the last month or so, it is a welcomed development. In terms of points of interest when eyeing the derivatives landscape, the buildup of liquidatable leverage above $70,000 continues to grow, with emboldened shorts looking to push price meaningfully below $60,000. While there is some leverage to be purged under the $60,000 level, the real prize for bears is under the $50,000 level. While certainly crazier things have happened in Bitcoin than a -33% pullback from all-time highs, spot demand is likely to be strong from $50,000, and a wipe of open interest and the start of a negative futures premium relative to spot markets hint at most of the pullback having already taken place. It would likely take a significant risk-off moment across the macro landscape for this to unfold, and any dip is likely to be fleeting given the perpetuating reality of the pace of fiscal deficit spending. Conclusion: This bull market has legs, and the current pullback from the highs, along with any future dips in the exchange rate, should be a welcomed development for investors with a sufficiently long time horizon who understand where this is all headed. Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals continue to improve, and pullbacks serve to purge leverage and weak handed speculators during secular bull markets. BTFD.

Private When Alexander \u201cAkin\u201d Fernandez first conceptualized Azteco over a decade ago, he simply wanted to make bitcoin easier to obtain. He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute. Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you don\u2019t have to disclose your identity to do so, not to mention the process of buying a voucher is quick and easy. Azteco offers both on-chain and Lightning capabilities, giving users the choice to redeem their BTC on either the Bitcoin base chain or the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payments network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. According to an estimate from Fernandez, over one million people have already purchased Azteco vouchers. But his aspirations are far beyond the already-impressive number of vouchers thus sold: he has his sights set on Azteco servicing a customer base of over 30 times that, as Azteco does its part in \u201cnormalizing\u201d Bitcoin. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: Where did the inspiration for Azteco come from? Akin Fernandez: It came from my own experience of finding out that getting bitcoin is very difficult. I realized it doesn't have to be like this. We could use a familiar system like a top-up voucher, which billions of people use to top up their mobile phones, and apply that process to getting bitcoin. All we have to do is build a software, put distribution in place, and then it should just work. And lo and behold, it does. Corva: Did you have a particular customer base in mind when you designed Azteco? Fernandez: Yes, I had myself in mind. I wanted to be able to get bitcoin without having to make any kind of fuss or effort to do it. I wanted to be able to go to the supermarket, buy $20 worth of bitcoin and put it straight onto my wallet. And I'm not unique. I could assume that there were other people who were like me who could understand the proposition and the ease of use and who would take to it like a duck to water. You find that with inventions, many times they come about because people are solving problems for themselves, not as a means to get rich or for any reason other than to solve their own problems. And because people are similar, they solve other people's problems, too. Corva: Speaking of your own experience. I\u2019ve read that you were unbanked for a period of time. Is this true and could you expand on it, if so? Fernandez: Well, I became unbanked for a reason that I, until this day, don't know. I went down to \u201cmy\u201d bank to cash a check, and they couldn't find my account in the system. I had received no communication from them in writing or in any way. All of a sudden, I had no bank account. So, for many years after that I didn't have access to credit cards or anything that other people in the West take for granted. This taught me a very, very big lesson about how difficult it is to do anything in the 21st century if you don't have access to banking facilities. You can forget shopping online. You can forget any kind of convenience of going into a store and paying with a card. All of that goes away. So, when I was working on Azteco, it was made clear to me how powerful a tool it was going to be, because, with Bitcoin, you cannot be unbanked by any third party. You have control over your synthetic money. Corva: I\u2019ve heard you use this term \u201csynthetic money\u201d before, and you\u2019ve discussed how we shouldn\u2019t refer to bitcoin as actual money. Why is it important that we do this? Fernandez: It's important because it's true. Bitcoin is not money \u2014 it's a database. Can it be used as money? Of course. It can be used as very, very good money. It's a good simulation of money. But it doesn't have to be money for it to be useful. Also, if you call bitcoin money, all the regulations that the state has imposed on actual money can be superimposed or brushed over Bitcoin inappropriately, making it hard to use and slower to spread. So, it's very important to tell the truth about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has taken so long to get into every nook and cranny because there's been this misconstruing of it as money. WhatsApp reached a billion people in four and a half years. That's the kind of spread into people's phones that we'd expect if the rails to get onto Bitcoin were frictionless, just like they are with WhatsApp. The fact that Bitcoin has not reached that number of people indicates that there's something wrong in the way people are thinking about it, and so it's important for us to think about it correctly. Corva: How many people is Azteco reaching? Put another way, how many vouchers did Azteco sell in Q3 or Q4 of 2023? Fernandez: The actual numbers I don't have at hand being the CEO and not the CFO. But we had our biggest ever month last month. I was told this yesterday. The number of vouchers we're selling is increasing, and this is a direct result of our increasing our distribution and also the sentiment towards Bitcoin changing on a global scale. We're the easiest way to get bitcoin. When people discover us, they say two things: \u201cFirst of all, why isn't everything as easy as this?\u201d and \u201cHow come I haven't heard of this before?\u201d Things are synergizing and coming together to bring us to a point where we're a global force for good and for getting Bitcoin to the people who need it the most \u2014 the unbanked and the people who don't have access to financial rails or people who just don't want to be the victims of the financial rails. The old school crop of Bitcoin businesses that have been serving people over the last 10 years all believe that Bitcoin is money and make it very difficult to get an account. Everybody's so inured to the idea of having a bank account or an account of any kind, whether it's through email or anything else. The assumption immediately is, \u201cWell, of course, I have to have an account in order to use this service.\u201d With Bitcoin, that's not true, though. No accounts are necessary. [Some] wallet companies are doing this correctly. One of them is Samourai Wallet and another is Wallet of Satoshi where you don\u2019t need to open an account to use your own money. They\u2019re saying you shouldn\u2019t be able to use bitcoin without having an account. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do in the EU. Corva: We\u2019re doing it here in the US with the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA), too, the bill that Elizabeth Warren drafted. Fernandez: These people are oath breakers. They\u2019ve sworn an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution, which guarantees the free speech of every single American. Bitcoin is speech. It's a database where speech is written down and stored and transmitted from one person to another. And lest anyone think that I'm picking on the Democrats and not the Republicans, Cynthia Lummis has written an absolutely appalling bill that I took great pleasure in tearing to pieces on my blog. They don\u2019t understand what their role is as a public servant. A servant is not in control of its masters. A servant is obedient to the electorate. It\u2019s not their business to tell people you have to KYC to use bitcoin. Corva: On the topic of America and KYC-free bitcoin, do you see people using Azteco because they want KYC-free bitcoin? Fernandez: In order for the American market to be cracked, the service has to be explained. People have to be deprogrammed. They don\u2019t understand that bitcoin is not a vehicle to make you earn more fiat. People need to be broken out of these bad habits to be shown that actually there are better ways to get things done. The perfect example of this is WhatsApp. Before WhatsApp, people used to pay for SMS messages, while the idea of this is now unthinkable. A similar process has to happen with Bitcoin where you can send money to family members without having to go through a third party or pay exorbitant fees or identify yourself or anything like that. With Bitcoin, you [also] get other subtle benefits. Hyperinflation is starting to kick in and people are starting to realize that there\u2019s something wrong with the money. People find it very difficult to go to the root cause of the prices going up at McDonalds. Let\u2019s say they did find out the cause, what could they do about it? They could go and get bitcoin, but it\u2019s several steps down before these people are going to see bitcoin as the answer. Corva: I agree. Fernandez: Also, the current crop of businesses \u2014 big businesses like Binance, Coinbase \u2014 are synonymous with bitcoin. Azteco needs to be synonymous with getting bitcoin. The vast majority of people on earth are not rich. They don't have $100,000 to spend on bitcoin. They live day to day. Since these people are not investors and they don't have spare money to keep in bitcoin in the hopes that it's going to go up \u2014 which of course it will \u2014 they need to have bitcoin as daily money for everyday spending. Once you start talking about these things, the business opportunities and models start to just fall out of the conversation. All of these Cynthia Lummises and Elizabeth Warrens prevent these business models from emerging because they're regulating something they have no business regulating. Corva: Speaking of other businesses, I\u2019ve heard you say good things about Machankura, a protocol that makes it easier for Africans to use bitcoin in a KYC manner, and that it serves as a compliment to Azteco. What other companies in the Bitcoin space are a compliment to Azteco? Fernandez: Ethical Bitcoin wallets are a good compliment. By ethical, I mean Samourai Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi. I know that some people don\u2019t like Wallet of Satoshi because the architecture on the backend is not to their liking, but these people don\u2019t run businesses \u2014 they don\u2019t know how difficult it is to do these things. The newest entrant to this is the Bitkey wallet. This Bitkey wallet is absolutely unbelievable. They've thought about this properly. The user interface and user experience \u2014 it's going to make everybody change their game. I've been saying for a long time that somebody like Apple, Microsoft or some other company is going to get into Bitcoin and bring all of that user experience thinking to the process of using Bitcoin. The current crop of companies have not thought about user experience. Jack Dorsey\u2019s Bitkey has been a kick in the backside to a lot of people who realize that we can't just carry on doing what we want to do and expecting people to just accept it \u2014 the idea that you have to write down your mnemonic before you receive your first transaction. It\u2019s completely crazy. If Apple developed its own Bitcoin wallet or clones one of the Bitcoin wallets out there, Bitcoin is going to be exposed to people in a way that's very easy to understand, very easy to consume. There will be the new generation of Bitcoin users for whom Bitcoin is totally normal \u2014 not threatening, intimidating or frightening. Corva: The same way that using WhatsApp or Uber is normal now\u2026 Fernandez: That's exactly right. Bitcoin has to become boring.","article_summary":"Alexander \u201cAkin\u201d Fernandez\u2019s Azteco provides Bitcoin users around the world a way to get their hands on \u201csynthetic money\u201d without revealing their identity, creating a world in which bitcoin is so ubiquitous and easy to use that it\u2019s boring.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/azteco-is-helping-millions-buy-bitcoin-without-sharing-their-identity","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T02:40:48Z","category":["bitcoin","lightning","azteco","founders","business"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/azteco-is-helping-millions-buy-bitcoin-without-sharing-their-identity","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"},{"article_title":"The Weekly Reorg: Bitcoin Fashion Week","author":"Alex Bergeron","article_detailed_content":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.

Similarly, this new crop of Bitcoin-adjacent protocol seems content launching with either no product or \u201cdecentralization on the roadmap.\u201d Under the layers of vapid marketing and technical mumbo jumbo, it\u2019s hard to find a trust model that is much better than the simple and often maligned Liquid federated sidechain. Forget unilateral exit, most of the \u201cLayer 2s\u201d on offer today can hardly qualify for the term under our admittedly loose policy here at Bitcoin Magazine. To make matters worse, variants of proof-of-stake have crept into the design space despite Ethereum\u2019s abysmal performance since its transition. Not surprisingly, the conversation has already devolved into ponzinomics to bootstrap the speculative flywheel. Colloquially styled \u201cpoints,\u201d a new token contraption has burst onto the scene and is all the rage amongst the designer crowd. This new liquidity farming fad requires users to deposit their bitcoins (and those of friends and family) somewhere in exchange for, you guessed it, yield. They\u2019re calling it gamification this time around. I think it\u2019s peak crypto nihilism. Fast fashion has officially made it into Bitcoin! The Emperor Has No Clothes? Speaking of catwalks and clownishly dressed individuals, the crew at Taproot Wizards recently unleashed pandemonium on the aspiring Layer 2 community by going at its most prized science project, BitVM. My esteemed colleague Shinobi put together a decent recap of the event. I wont bother you with the technical details but, of course, the claims remain hotly contested to this day. At least a dozen new companies\u2019 fate hangs in the balance here so you can imagine the smell when they were publicly outed to the fashion police. Although I\u2019m partial to the wizards\u2019 arguments, we should probably hold off on writing the obituary for BitVM. Jumping through liquidity hoops appears to be one of the pervasive tradeoffs one has to make when designing trust-minimized protocols on top of Bitcoin. Lightning has given us inbound liquidity headaches for years. Proposals like Ark have been dismissed because of the massive UTXOs operators have to fund. Maybe BitVM bridges can be designed to mitigate the upfront liquidity requirements of operators. At least, the issue is probably not enough for everyone to drop everything and go home. The unfortunate takeaway from this saga is that everyone involved comes away looking a bit amateurish. Despite claims to the contrary, some due diligence was clearly skipped. The issue could\u2019ve been run through a bit more collective brain cells before publishing and you can tell the targets all felt pretty blindsided by the announcement. To tie this all up, the wizards have just come out with their derivative proposal. It\u2019s hard not to get the impression that this was a bit of a setup motivated by marketing purposes. Then again, they\u2019re grown men wearing wizard hats, what do you expect? On the other hand, it is a valid issue and the response from \u201cteam\u201d BitVM hasn\u2019t been exactly gracious either. You\u2019d expect thicker skin from researchers who have been around the block. Banning people from a Telegram working group and hand-waving away the entire premise does not serve the interest of the community they are building for. They can disagree with the conclusions but the obvious outcome is that the audience and interest in BitVM have now grown beyond the small engineering circles where it was fomenting. Many have suggested it was probably the first time the mechanism was communicated in an accessible way. It was a missed opportunity for its advocates to leverage this attention and steer it their way if they thought the project was misrepresented. Hopefully, this is all just a failed dress rehearsal because I don\u2019t see how this is very inspiring for anyone seriously interested in contributing to this space. A grand finale Of course, a circus show isn\u2019t complete without the clown act. The hottest protocol designer in town is preparing to showcase his latest line just in time for the halving this Friday. Runes, a protocol for fungible tokens, is probably the most anticipated drop since the Jordan 1s. As we speak, hundreds of users are syncing up Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives in preparation for the festivities. The blockchain is expecting a record crowd for this event so be advised that tickets could get expensive. As for myself, I\u2019ll probably just watch from my balcony in the comfort of my safe and ever-reliable Bitcoin jeans. Tick tock, next block.","article_summary":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T02:13:55Z","category":["technical","culture","layer 2"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin DevCon To Take Place Alongside Bitcoin Asia  ","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","article_detailed_content":"In addition to showcasing the world\u2019s most important Bitcoin companies and leaders of today, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for the next generation of Bitcoin startups to meet, build, and get in front of the community.

However, while we\u2019re all keenly aware of BTC\u2019s impact on financial markets (a more or less permanent fixture of the news cycle), we often forget to take a step back and look at how this new frontier affects real change and real people. For those historically marginalized by traditional banking due to barriers like poor credit or lack of accessibility, BTC has emerged as a vital financial tool. Its impact is most profound in developing countries, where access to banking still poses a challenge for many. Here, Bitcoin serves as more than a currency or an investment; it's a means to engage in essential financial activities, such as sending and receiving money, that would otherwise be out of reach. Forget, at least for a minute, the speculative potential in terms of financial gain\u2014the true value of Bitcoin lies in its potential to level the financial playing field, offering access to financial tools that were previously exclusive to those with more established economic backgrounds. Amid its fluctuating value, the enduring promise of Bitcoin is its contribution to financial inclusivity, making it a beacon of hope for more equitable access to financial services worldwide. Historical context of Bitcoin and financial inclusivity Bitcoin was born out of the financial turmoil of the late 2000s, with its creator(s) aiming to forge a decentralized currency that could bypass traditional banking systems and help society at large traverse a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. This vision was not just technical but deeply ideological, seeking to empower individuals with financial autonomy. At its core, Bitcoin promised to make financial services accessible to anyone with internet access, regardless of their standing with conventional financial institutions. This promise has seen tangible realization in countries like Nigeria, where traditional banking services are out of reach for many. In Nigeria, Bitcoin has become more than a speculative asset\u2014for instance, with the country's significant diaspora, Bitcoin facilitates remittances, enabling Nigerians living abroad to send money home more efficiently and at lower costs compared to traditional banking services. In Argentina, Bitcoin has emerged as a crucial financial tool amidst the country's ongoing economic challenges, including high inflation rates and currency devaluation. For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers a more stable store of value compared to the national currency, the Argentine peso, which has suffered from significant depreciation over the years. A similar trend can be noticed in Ghana, where the annual inflation rate is predicted to land in the 13% to 17% range in 2024. In Venezuela, a country grappling with political instability and economic crises, Bitcoin has found a unique role beyond just a means of preserving wealth against hyperinflation. Here, Bitcoin is being utilized to support microfinance initiatives and charitable donations, directly impacting the lives of those in need. Organizations and platforms leveraging cryptocurrency can bypass traditional financial systems, which are often inaccessible or unreliable for the country's impoverished populations, to provide direct financial assistance. Moreover, for entrepreneurs and small business owners the world over, it offers a means to engage in international transactions without the need for bank accounts or the risk of currency devaluation. It\u2019s both a hedge against crisis and a vessel of freedom against authoritarian regimes, but the decentralization schtick isn\u2019t The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing the digital currency, BTC ETFs offer a familiar, regulated avenue for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin space. Previously, the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin deterred many institutional investors. However, with the advent of ETFs and other regulated investment products, these entities can now participate in the cryptocurrency market, bringing with them substantial capital inflows and increased legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, which will only increase with further adoption. This institutional foray into Bitcoin has a dual impact. On one hand, it introduces a level of stability and liquidity previously unseen, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. On the other, it represents a shift from Bitcoin's original ethos of decentralization and democratization of finance. Another point to consider is that institutional interest isn\u2019t limited to private, for-profit enterprises\u2014with countries like El Salvador, which recently took custody of its national Bitcoin treasury showcasing that, slowly but surely, the general attitude of governments towards cryptocurrencies is also changing with the times. Potential impacts of institutionalization on accessibility On the one hand, these developments can enhance Bitcoin's appeal by contributing to market stability and reducing volatility\u2014a key concern that has deterred a broader demographic from embracing cryptocurrencies. The entry of institutional investors can also increase liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially making it a more reliable asset for individuals and businesses worldwide. However, the flip side of institutionalization is the potential increase in barriers to entry for marginalized groups. The very essence of Bitcoin's appeal to these groups is its accessibility: the ability to participate in the financial system with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection. As regulatory frameworks become more stringent and the market more institutionalized, the processes for acquiring and using Bitcoin could become more complex. Requirements such as rigorous identity verification and compliance with financial regulations, while necessary for fraud prevention and financial security, could inadvertently sideline those without formal identification or those living in regions with less regulatory clarity. Moreover, the shift towards institutionalization might lead to a concentration of wealth and power within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reminiscent of traditional financial systems. This concentration could undermine the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, making it less about empowering the individual and more about serving institutional interests. The challenge lies in finding a balance: leveraging institutional interest to bring stability and legitimacy to Bitcoin while ensuring that its revolutionary promise of financial inclusivity remains intact. Financial inclusion and cryptocurrency adoption Sub-Saharan Africa, with its blend of limited banking infrastructure and high mobile penetration, has emerged as a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. The region, marked by its smaller overall market size in terms of traditional financial metrics, shows a significantly high level of grassroots cryptocurrency usage. Nigeria, for example, not only ranks second on the Global Crypto Adoption Index but also leads Sub-Saharan Africa in raw transaction volume, as well as the world in P2P exchange trade volume ranking. Other countries like Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa also feature prominently on the index, underlining the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial instruments The adoption is driven largely by practical necessities rather than speculative interests, with cryptocurrencies serving as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. In Ghana, where inflation surged to its highest level in two decades at the tail end of 2022, and in other nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa facing similar economic challenges, cryptocurrencies have become an attractive means of preserving wealth. The shift towards digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, and more recently, stablecoins, reflects a broader search for financial stability and freedom Peer-to-peer transactions, especially prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa, account for a significant portion of crypto transactions, underscoring the region's unique position in the global crypto landscape. This high rate of P2P transactions is attributed to the everyday use of crypto for retail payments, remittances, and commercial transactions. The preference for crypto over traditional banking and financial services is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity in regions where local currencies are losing value, as seen in countries like Nigeria and Kenya Through bypassing traditional financial barriers, cryptocurrencies offer expanded finance options to underserved markets, exemplified by initiatives like Empowa and Pezesha in Mozambique and Kenya that utilize blockchain to facilitate real estate development and connect MSMEs with global lenders. Balancing institutional interest and financial inclusivity As Bitcoin continues to navigate the waters between grassroots empowerment and institutional adoption, its future landscape presents a dichotomy. On one side, increased institutional interest brings stability and credibility, potentially making Bitcoin a more viable and trusted financial asset globally. On the other, this shift could challenge the very inclusivity that has been a cornerstone of Bitcoin's appeal, particularly among minority groups and in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. To ensure that Bitcoin remains a tool for empowerment, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential pathway is the development of regulatory frameworks that encourage inclusivity. Regulations could be designed to protect consumers without stifling innovation or access to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the continued support and promotion of peer-to-peer platforms can empower individuals by facilitating direct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Conclusion As Bitcoin evolves amidst rising institutional interest, its foundational role as an agent of financial inclusivity faces both challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that Bitcoin continues to serve marginalized communities requires a delicate balance, blending the stability brought by institutional involvement with its potential as a democratizing force. One thing is certain\u2014the future of Bitcoin hinges in large part on maintaining its essence as a lifeline for financial empowerment across the globe. This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

This event will bring together prominent voices in the Bitcoin space including Barstool CEO Dave Portnoy, Strike CEO Jack Mallers, Bitcoin Magazine Institutional Lead Dylan LeClair, and Ten31 Managing Partner Matt Odell. This halving event \u2013 projected to occur between April 19, 2024 \u2013 will occur as Bitcoin reaches block 840,000, marking the point at which its relative supply issuance will drop below that of gold for the first time. Previous halvings have historically acted as a turning point in the market as the reduction in newly issued coins has been met with surging demand for the currency throughout each prior halving cycle. This time around, the halving has been preceded by a new all-time high, an occurrence that has never happened since Bitcoin\u2019s inception in January 2009. Between the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (arguably the most successful ETF debut in history) by major financial institutions, and a potential resurgence in inflation, the Bitcoin bulls are on parade driving the market higher into uncharted territory. Other guests slated to appear on the livestream are Bitcoin Magazine Chief Content Officer Pete Rizzo, Human Rights Foundation Director of Financial Freedom Christian Keroles, Simply Bitcoin Founder Nico Moran, Bitcoin Magazine Correspondent Isabella Santos, and Pomp Investments Founder Anthony Pompliano. Click here for more information on the Bitcoin Halving Livestream powered by Kraken In the countdown to Bitcoin\u2019s fourth epoch, Livestream guests will review the Top 21 Moments of the past four years, as voted on by Bitcoin Magazine readers. Top moments include the rise of the Laser Eyes meme, MicroStrategy unveiling of its bitcoin-based treasury strategy, and the notorious rise and fall of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. In partnership with Nitrobetting, Bitcoin Magazine will be awarding a 1 BTC prize pool for the Bitcoin Halving Challenge to contestants who most closely predict the price of the currency at Block 840,000. Viewers will be able to count down to the halving with some of the biggest names in the space and commemorate the growth of Bitcoin with a New Year\u2019s Eve-style celebration with Bitcoiners from around the world.

For as long as humans have been organizing into social groups, we\u2019ve been hating on the group in the next valley. Even though we have much more in common with them than we would care to admit. It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. These differences aren\u2019t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can\u2019t even recall why they disliked one another in the first place. But it wasn\u2019t always that way: and it doesn\u2019t have to stay this way. There are signs that the rivalry that has polarized bitcoiners and ethereans is starting to thaw. If these frenemies can bury the hatchet and work together, it will make web3 a better place for everyone. From Divergence to Convergence It\u2019s easy to forget that Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin cut his teeth at Bitcoin Magazine and was a regular poster on the Bitcointalk forum. When the Ethereum ICO was held in 2014, funds were raised at a ratio of 2,000 ETH per BTC. It\u2019s also easy to forget that many of the use cases now synonymous with Ethereum have Bitcoin ancestors, such as NFT precursor Colored Coins. Even the concept of a Layer 2 has Bitcoin beginnings. But all that\u2019s ancient history now. BTC has assumed the mantle of store of value and global reserve currency, while ETH has become the fuel that launched 100 EVM chains and 10,000 tokens. Along the way, the continental drift pushing the two ecosystems apart has been expedited by Ethereum\u2019s move to Proof of Stake, leaving Bitcoin as the only top 20 coin aside from DOGE still wedded to Proof of Work. While the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are stark, they are not irreconcilable. One of the most fascinating aspects of the chains\u2019 evolving use cases is the way in which each has emulated the other. Ethereum is well on its way to becoming a somewhat stable store of value of its own, and looks poised to follow Bitcoin in receiving an ETF. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has belatedly spawned its own multi-chain and multi-token ecosystem thanks to Ordinals, BRC20, Runes, Stacks, and similar protocols. Bitcoin-native DeFi and NFTs are now a thing \u2013 even if most maximalists aren\u2019t on board. While it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin DeFi takes off, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s now more that unites the two chains than divides them. Bitcoin and Ethereum have moved in opposing directions over the years but their paths are finally starting to converge. Choose Tech, Not Tribalism Rather than arguing over whose tech trumps whose, or who implemented it first, there are clear benefits to the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities setting aside their differences. Just as globalism diminished petty tribalism (even if we simply swapped hating the guy in the next valley for hating internet strangers), the multi-chain era has rendered blockchain wars pointless. Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer isolated islands but interconnected hubs that routinely exchange value through bridges, portals, and wrappers. Isn\u2019t it time they started swapping developer talent too? The onus is on builders to find ways that both technology stacks can enhance one another. This is the key to scaling web3 and growing adoption. The rise of Ordinals has shown there is strong interest in utilizing the Bitcoin network as more than simply a means to store value. But building out further utility natively is complex since the network is not Turing complete by nature and its simplistic UTXO model and limited block space cannot handle complex data and calculations. While there have been many avenues explored for scaling Bitcoin, they all relied on a level of centralization until the Taproot upgrade which brought Schnorr Signature and MAST contracts. These upgrades have made it possible to design fully trustless bridges between the Bitcoin ecosystem and other networks, allowing for truly decentralized scaling solutions to be realized. The Ethereum ecosystem is already home to a robust suite of tools, smart contracts and applications that can be utilized to bring further compatibility and functionality to Bitcoin. It makes far more sense for Bitcoin to inherit the technology that already exists for certain functions rather than rebuild them from the ground up. Scale Bitcoin, Enhance Ethereum An obvious solution to scaling Bitcoin at the consumer level and building out new use cases is to utilize the functionality enabled by Taproot to create trustless bridges between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks. This can create a wave of new opportunities for both ecosystems by unlocking new ways for Bitcoin holders to engage while increasing the liquidity within Ethereum-based chains. While the possibility of utilizing EVM-compatible technology to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem is promising, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome will not be technological but cultural. While human ingenuity is boundless, our tendency to drag one another down like a bucket of crabs remains deeply ingrained. All crypto communities should strive to shun the cutthroat behaviors web2 was built on and find ways to collaborate. Only once this is done can web3 realize its full potential.

China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and other applicants posted on social media that they got clearance to list spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. However, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has yet to release an official list of approved issuers. According to the posts, the SFC greenlit China Asset Management to offer spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in partnership with OSL and BOCI International. Other approved issuers include Harvest Global Investments, HashKey Capital, and Bosera Asset Management. The news mirrors the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which launched in January and quickly attracted over $200 billion in trading volume. Hong Kong's approval marks a milestone as Asia's first jurisdiction to embrace spot Bitcoin ETFs. The ETFs provide exposure to actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, offering investors direct access to the assets. They also present a regulated investment vehicle that mitigates some of Bitcoin's risks. By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its Bitcoin-friendly stance amid ongoing efforts to become a finance hub. The accessibly traded funds could stimulate significant retail and institutional demand. However, an official SFC announcement remains pending. Some of the social media posts sharing the alleged approval have since been deleted. The opacity around permissions could contribute to market uncertainty in the near term. Nonetheless, the reported approvals signal a willingness by Hong Kong's regulators to meet surging investor appetite for Bitcoin.

Click here to download a PDF of this 7,000 word essay on the origins of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1] The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology. Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T\u2019s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks. The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity. But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation\u2014 it\u2019s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph. This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed\u2014and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future. Outline I. Decentralized systems are markets II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods III. How can decentralized systems price computations? IV. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin V. Conclusion A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai\u2019s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts \u201cfrom exactly that point.\u201d In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin.

Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented: Digital currencies should be P2P networks Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation Money is created through an auction Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins Transactions are batched into blocks Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work All blocks are stored by all participants Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn\u2019t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi\u2019s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list. Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place? This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi\u2019s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money. I. Decentralized systems are markets Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words \u201cdecentralized\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces. For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the topology of their network diagrams, but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets. Distributed systems rely upon central authorities In this work, we take \u201cdistributed\u201d to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as \u201cnodes\u201d) which must communicate, typically over a network. Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems. But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system. Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes. The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system. Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required. In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system. Decentralized systems have no central authorities We take \u201cdecentralized\u201d to have a stronger meaning than \u201cdistributed\u201d: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for \u201cdecentralized\u201d is \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d (P2P). Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems: Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry\u2014anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority. Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage. Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert. These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin: \"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of\u2026 centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" - Nakamoto, 2008 But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority. Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi\u2019s nod to Gnutella, anyone who\u2019s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online. Satoshi didn\u2019t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam. Decentralized systems are governed through incentives The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating. Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they\u2019re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly. The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market\u2019s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system. II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility. Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges. Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true\u2014traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane. This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems. Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems. Computation is the first decentralized good The first example of a \u201cdecentralized good\u201d is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3] Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources\u2014they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce. The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital \u201cproof\u201d that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given \u201cdifficulty\u201d which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority. The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called \u201cproof-of-work\u201d.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo\u2019s phrase, \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource: \"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource.\" - Dwoak & Naor, 1993 In Dwork & Naor\u2019s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email. Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a \u201cpricing function\u201d because, by adjusting the difficulty, a \u201cpricing authority\u201d could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a \u201cprice\u201d for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam. Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature \u201cpricing function\u201d and \u201cpricing authority\u201d supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource\u2019s controller. In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations. Currency is the second decentralized good But computations aren\u2019t a good currency. The proofs used to \u201ctrade\u201d computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can\u2019t be reused for a different input. Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider. This constraint is useful \u2013 it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender\u2019s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can\u2019t be respent for sending a different email. But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren\u2019t fungible, they can\u2019t be re-spent,[5] and they don\u2019t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash. Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems: \"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use.\" - Adam Back, 1997 We don\u2019t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market. Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere \u201caccess control mechanism\u201d. Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers\u2026in the units of the currency that\u2019s being created! Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives. Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure. The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints. Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it: Computations through proof-of-work Units of the currency we\u2019re trying to build The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy\u2014the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself! The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo\u2019s bit gold and Wei Dai\u2019s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded. III. How can decentralized systems price computations? A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency. We don\u2019t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called \u201cprogress\u201d. Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn\u2019t be progress\u2014it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value. When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable \u201cprices\u201d and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function. But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty\u2014 as measured by the number of corresponding computations\u2014may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price? Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold: \"The main problem\u2026is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract \"compute cycle.\" \u2026Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold.\" - Szabo, 2005 A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations. Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the \u201ccost of computing\u201d. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money: 'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.\" - Dai, 1998 Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a \u201cstandard basket\u201d, which computer solves a given problem \u201cmost economically\u201d, or the cost of computation on the \u201copen market\u201d. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems! To be fair to Dai, he realized this: \"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol.\" - Dai, 1998 Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let\u2019s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo\u2019s insights into the problem. Use external markets Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be \u201csecurely timestamped\u201d: \"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on.\" - Szabo, 2005 Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases \u201csecurely\u201d and \u201cdistributed fashion\u201d are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) \u201coutside the system\u201d services for timestamping.[6] The time a unit of digital currency was created is important because it links the computations performed to real-world production cost. Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right\u2014the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation: \"\u2026However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 \"Inferring\u201d the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible: \"\u2026Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency: \"\u2026[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.\" - Szabo, 2005 To paraphrase Szabo, \u201cto assay the value of\u2026 bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp\u201d. The dealers defining \u201clarger units of approximately equal value\u201d are providing a similar pricing function as Dai\u2019s \u201cstandard basket of commodities\u201d. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger \u201cunits of approximately equal value\u201d by dealers in markets outside the network. To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw: \"\u2026The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address.\" - Szabo, 2005 Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money. Use internal markets Szabo\u2019s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it? Let\u2019s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi\u2019s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney\u2019s auction model[7]: \"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]\u2026 instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures. Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on. Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation. Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly.\" Dai, 1998 B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo\u2019s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other. But implementing Dai\u2019s proposal as written would be challenging: In the \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the \u201coptimal increase in the money supply for the next period\u201d. How \u201coptimal\u201d should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described. Regardless of what was planned, the \u201cBidding\u201d phase allows anyone to submit a \u201cbid\u201d to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money. Once bids are submitted, the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it\u2019s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted \u2013 when does the \u201cBidding\u201d phase end and the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase begin? These problems recur in the \u201cMoney ]reation\u201d phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of \u201chighest bids\u201d? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency? Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented. The root of this complexity is Dai\u2019s belief that the \u201coptimal\u201d rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create units of b-money by broadcasting a bid and then doing the corresponding proof-of-work. Both Szabo and Dai proposed using a market exchanging digital currency for computations yet neither bit gold nor b-money defined a monetary policy to regulate the supply of currency within this market.

Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi\u2019s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote: \"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\" - Satoshi, 2009 Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks\u2014with a concern about monetary policy. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The \u201coptimal\u201d rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi \u201cdiscovered\u201d bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. \u2014and not someone else. It\u2019s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply. A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It\u2019s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai\u2019s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let\u2019s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint. All 21M bitcoin already exist In b-money, each \u201cmoney creation period\u201d included a \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, in which users were expected to share their \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project. Satoshi was able to replace the recurring \u201cPlanning\u201d phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. This changes the semantics of bitcoin\u2019s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it\u2019s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that \u201cbitcoin miners create bitcoin\u201d. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they\u2019re buying it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t valuable because \u201cbitcoin are made from energy\u201d\u2014bitcoin\u2019s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. Let\u2019s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn\u2019t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus. Satoshi\u2019s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing \u201cPlanning\u201d phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin. Bitcoin is priced through consensus This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the \u201cBidding\u201d phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation \u201cbids\u201d from many different users. Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn\u2019t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi\u2019s predetermined schedule. The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8] The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi\u2019s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block: The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section): Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price. Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus \u201cblockchain\u201d containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain. Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy \u2013 just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented. This added complexity was removed by Satoshi\u2019s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Time closes all spreads In the \u201cComputation\u201d phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they\u2019d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller \u2013 but who is the buyer? In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner\u2019s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to \u201cexecute a trade\u201d but to pay the current asking price in computations. The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid\u2014the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network\u2019s current asking price. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008 Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin\u2019s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let\u2019s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn\u2019t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn\u2019t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. But Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo\u2019s \u201csecure timestamping protocol.\u201d Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a \u201cdistributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,\u201d and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world \u201ctimechain\u201d rather than \u201cblockchain\u201d to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work market.[10] Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations. Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time. A standing order creates consensus The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the \u201cMoney creation\u201d phase of b-money. User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the \u201chighest bids\u2026in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created\u201d in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the \u201cByzantine generals\u201d or sometimes the \u201cdouble-spend\u201d problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem \u2013 socalled \u201cByzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms\u201d\u2014require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network\u2019s current asking price\u2014 nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner\u2019s resources. Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin\u2019s market has no phases\u2014it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network. This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] We established in previous sections that bitcoin\u2019s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! Moreover, this new \u201cNakamoto consensus\u201d only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing. IV. Conclusion B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi\u2019s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin\u2019s implementation. There is a lot more to bitcoin\u2019s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the \u201cprimary\u201d market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.

In particular, Ryan Gentry, Will Cole and Stephen Hall met with me weekly to debate these ideas. I would not have been able to overcome countless false starts without their contributions and their support. Ryan also helped me begin talking about these ideas publicly in our Bitcoin 2021 talk. Afsheen Bigdeli, Allen Farrington, Joe Kelly, Gigi, Tuur Demeester, and Marty Bent, have all encouraged me over the years and provided valuable feedback. I must also apologize to Allen for turning out to be such a lousy collaborator. Finally, Michael Goldstein may be better known for his writing & memes, but I\u2019d like to thank him for the archival work he does at the Nakamoto Institute to keep safe the history of digital currencies. Footnotes [1] The title of this series is taken from the first telegraph message in history, sent by Samuel Morse in 1844: \u201cWhat hath God wrought?\u201d.

[5] Hal Finney\u2019s RPOW project was an attempt at creating transferable proofs-of-work but bitcoin doesn\u2019t use this concept because it doesn't treat computations as currency. As we\u2019ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. [6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. [7] Dai\u2019s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi\u2019s white paper, available: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt [8]There are two simplifications being made here: a. The number of bitcoin being sold in each block is also affected by the transaction fee market, which is out of scope for this article, though lookout for subsequent work. b. The difficulty as reported by bitcoin is not exactly the number of expected computations; one must multiply by a proportionality factor.

You don\u2019t often see the term \u201cRoth IRA\u201d trending online, but in 2021, tech investor Peter Thiel made headlines for his $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA piggy bank. How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny. \u201cThiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.\u201d \u2013 ProPublica (2021) Let\u2019s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures. The different IRA structures The different IRA structures can behave in an \u201cevery square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares\u201d kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA. Brokerage and Bank IRAs Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The Unchained IRA is closest to this structure in this hierarchy. Self-directed IRA (SDIRA) A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn\u2019t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that are not allowed (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.). Checkbook IRA Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (\u201ccheckbook control\u201d). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA. Non-checkbook self-directed IRA A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA 1. Liquidity Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy. 2. Formation and legal structure When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account. With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA. 3. Misreporting transactions Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions. At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit fair market valuation (FMV) information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law. 4. \u201cDeemed distribution\u201d treatment Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of \u201cdeemed distributions\u201d treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC\u2019s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the LLC\u2019s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA. It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying \u201cdeemed distribution\u201d treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to IRS Publication 590, it\u2019s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. Read more about the McNulty case and its implications. 5. Prohibited transactions All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. \u201cSelf-dealing\u201d is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself\u2014not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide \u201csweat equity.\u201d It\u2019s not only the IRA owner that can\u2019t participate in any \u201cself-dealing,\u201d but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and penalties are stiff. These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don\u2019t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the IRS list of prohibited transactions here. Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors: Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets Leverage without a non-recourse loan Investing in certain collectible NFTs1 6. Financing Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons: Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases. Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits. IRA-owned active businesses could run into the issue of UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin mining within an IRA. Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA\u2019s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs. What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs? The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls. Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA If you\u2019re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It\u2019s not a \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations. There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it\u2019ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time \u2013 adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope \u2013 ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it\u2019s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the experience of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal\u2019s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0 is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions \u2013 but don\u2019t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network \u2013 we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we do broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork \u2013 presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we\u2019ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can\u2019t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) \u201cLayer Connector\u201d that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs! With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes) A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per \u201clayer\u201d (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.) The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the \u201cDispatcher\u201d. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn\u2019t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can\u2019t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the \u201cparent\u201d. In order for miners to capture the fees from this \u201cchild\u201d transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10\u2019s or 100\u2019s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we\u2019d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would: look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the \u201csplit\u201d transaction here: https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb. The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn\u2019t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas. Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. There are other aspects of the project that we haven\u2019t covered here \u2013 how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one\u2019s easy: it\u2019s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. This is a guest post by Rijndael.

The country has since bet big on Bitcoin, building Bitcoin reserves, mining BTC, and launching educational initiatives. However, the IMF has objected to the Bitcoin law amid loan negotiations with El Salvador, which needs financing to pay debts and obligations. Talks have stalled for nearly two years over the IMF's calls to limit Bitcoin's scope in the country. According to the IMF's communications director Julie Kozack on last Thursday, the \"risks\" of Bitcoin remain a key issue in discussions with El Salvador. The IMF has previously cited financial integrity and stability concerns about Bitcoin. The fund's opposition highlights a clash over the future of money and payments. While Bukele sees Bitcoin as an innovative solution for financial inclusion, the IMF remains wary of its volatility and decentralized nature, and a threat to their dominance. Irrespective of pressures, El Salvador has stood firm on its Bitcoin commitment. The country has invested over $150 million in BTC reserves, continually buying more. Bukele also pledged to purchase 1 BTC daily. The IMF loan impasse puts El Salvador in a difficult fiscal position. By tying loan access to changes in El Salvador's Bitcoin law, the IMF is exerting its influence over poorer nations. But Bukele seems unwilling to back down on Bitcoin, creating an ideological tug-of-war. El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin adoption signaled a shift toward decentralization and self-determination. Demands to roll back the Bitcoin law undermine the country's monetary sovereignty. The standoff illustrates the disruptive potential of Bitcoin to reshape global finance. While risky for El Salvador in the near-term, Bukele's Bitcoin bet could pay long-run dividends.","article_summary":"The IMF is reportedly demanding changes to El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin law amid $1.4 billion credit negotiations, underscoring tensions over Bitcoin's disruptive potential.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-12T18:17:16Z","category":["el salvador"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTg0MjMzMzU2NjAxMzM3Njg1/nayib-bukele-bitcoin-el-salvador.png"},{"article_title":"TD Bank Releases Commercial Explaining The Bitcoin Halving And Promotes ETFs","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"TD Bank subsidiary TD Direct Investing recently uploaded a video on its YouTube channel explaining in detail the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around April 19 or 20.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event. What is Bitcoin halving? The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors. Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving. 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I\u2019ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren. 5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that\u2019s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs. Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a \"hodling\" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income? Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment. 5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively. Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving Efficiency is Key: Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem. Strategic Planning: Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols. Adapt and Evaluate: Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards. Collaborative Mining: Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards. Leverage Mining Solutions: Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving. What is the difficulty of mining after halving? The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa. Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include: Mining Altcoins: While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue. Mining Pools and Services: Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects. Hardware Sales and Leasing: Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations. Staking and Masternodes: Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees. Blockchain Development and Consulting: Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting. Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments: Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies. Energy Trading and Grid Services: Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs. Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions: Price Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics. Speculative Activity: Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions. Market Sentiment: Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines. Miner Behavior: The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics. Macro-Economic Factors: External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements. Long-Term Outlook: Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest. While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved. Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition? Efficiency Improvements: One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs. Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing: Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability. Vertical Integration: Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams. Diversification of Revenue Streams: As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments. Hedging Strategies: Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions. Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability. Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions. To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events: November 28, 2012: Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. July 9, 2016: The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. May 20, 2020: The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch \u2014 a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years \u2013 will see Bitcoin\u2019s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. ~94% of the total #bitcoin supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days 👀 Digital scarcity at its finest 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024 Gold Throughout the Ages One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a \u201cfine man\u2019s suit\u201d over time. This principle, known as the \u201cgold-to-decent-suit ratio,\u201d can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga. While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man\u2019s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges. For example, the cost of verification \u2013 or assaying \u2013 gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value. Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous \u201dNixon Shock\u201d in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good. This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. Executive Order 6102 comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited \u201cthe hoarding of gold coin\u201d, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value. Bitcoin\u2019s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven? Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals. As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years \u2013 reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024. Source: Glassnode While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a store of value better than gold, it is certainly promising. This \u201cmagic internet money\u201d continues to rapidly gain on gold\u2019s estimated $15.9 trillion market capitalization. Gold\u2019s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals. Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its informational nature, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute. Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s network of nodes and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s rise as a monetary good \u2013 predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable \u2013 has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold\u2019s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement. While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time. Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s time to shine.","article_summary":"For the first time, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is set to surpass gold after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China. Hong Kong\u2019s new ETF has been in the making for several months now, and it\u2019s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it\u2019s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) already passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it\u2019s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market. Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of big players from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media reported that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city. Considering that there are already signs of diminishing ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis report $90 billion worth of transactions in one year? Source Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves many windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: \u201cIf you get scammed, don\u2019t expect our help or sympathy.\" Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions. It\u2019s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it\u2019s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they\u2019ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have invested heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that\u2019s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. Click the image to learn more. Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong\u2019s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin\u2019s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? As far as Hong Kong\u2019s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local banks shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. The South China Morning Post reported on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new \u201cGlobal\u201d initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to \u201covertake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\" A very tall order. And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the Post that \u201cWe have seen their data and we don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be difficult\u201d. He added that most global competitors are either \u201ceasy to use but not compliant\u201d, or \u201ccompliant but hard to use\u201d, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It\u2019s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to offer nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business\u2019 reigning champs won\u2019t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was reportedly mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city\u2019s own existing firms are confident that they\u2019ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? It\u2019s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It\u2019s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.","article_summary":"With Hong Kong asset managers somewhat reluctant to submit applications for the new ETF, a series of multibillion-dollar firms from Mainland China have entered the market.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-11T21:00:00Z","category":["bitcoin etf","hong kong","markets","bitcoin magazine pro"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count. Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. \u201cThe early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for \u2018crypto\u2019 venture\u2019s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,\u201d said Calicott. \u201cWith a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.\u201d In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested. \u201cDue to cyclicality and bitcoin\u2019s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,\u201d Calicott continued. \u201cDespite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.\u201d TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.

Sound Advisory provides financial advisory services and specializes in educating and guiding clients to thrive financially in a bitcoin-powered world. Click here to learn more. One of the simplest and most effective ways to improve your financial situation: Don\u2019t get killed on taxes. Taxes are a major friction in most people\u2019s financial lives, and a little foresight and planning can go a long way. This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. Let\u2019s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies. Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back. The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how: KYC Compliance: All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings. Transaction History: Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions. Reporting to IRS: Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains. Legal Precedents: The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions. Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly. Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season. To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments. Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year. Source: Sound Advisory If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income. Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin\u2014bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. Strategies and Case Studies Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn\u2019t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. When accounting for transactions, it\u2019s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. The IRS allows for \u201cspecific identification\u201d accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item\u2014in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains. Scenario: Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000. With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000). With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000). HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case. These would be short-term capital gains, so let\u2019s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. It\u2019s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly. Tax loss harvesting Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we\u2019ll leave it here for future readers. In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price. Scenario: Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved. Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the tax loss carry forward technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains. If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain\u2019t so bad. Sign me up. I\u2019ll even pay it twice. And \u201ctaxable income\u201d is calculated after the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single). Scenario: Let\u2019s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free). And we\u2019ll assume that they live in one of the nine US states that don\u2019t have an income tax, so let\u2019s call it 0% state tax as well. It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free\u2014valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a strategic sell and immediate rebuy opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies Roth IRA conversions or liquidating assets through installment sales. Gifting We\u2019ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people. Charity When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed. Scenario: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he\u2019d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains. You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to have less bitcoin!\u201d If bitcoin holders are familiar with \u201cspend and replace,\u201d we can consider a similar strategy like \u201cdonate and replace.\u201d You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes. Donor-advised funds For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a \"charitable savings account\": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time. Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications. Friends and family Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you). Scenario: A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their \u201clifetime bucket.\u201d Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. Roth accounts Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability. If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings. If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution. Conclusion The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you. With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort. A note on wash sales The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin. Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended. Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit. It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency. 1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events. 2) These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. CONTACT Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

","author":"Ivan Serrano","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin has shown itself among the best-performing assets in the last decade. In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250\u2014a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset briefly touched $70,000 recently. With this kind of growth, it\u2019s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to \u201cHODL\" until it reaches new price highs. However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC? Bitcoin loans offer a solution that provides access to liquidity without letting go of your holdings. How does a Bitcoin loan work? Here, we delve into the unique mechanics of a Bitcoin loan. We discuss how the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the world of finance beyond trading by providing alternative means to secure loans while retaining access to potentially higher returns in the future. Click the image to learn more. Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments\u2014similar to how a bank operates. Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent\u2014thus becoming overcollateralized loans. How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings. Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: Risks associated with rehypothecation Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties. With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral\u2014or even 100 percent\u2014is at risk. Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on. Annual percentage rate (APR) The annual percentage rate, also known as the APR, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. LTV requirement The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates. Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV) The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. Tax implications Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best.

The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don\u2019t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification. Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.

Or is it the Laser-Eyed Maxis? Or is it both? The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it\u2019s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don\u2019t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn\u2019t have that, you likely didn\u2019t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. That dogma was necessary \u2014 without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn\u2019t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. Click the image above to subscribe! Which Church Do You Go To? The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn\u2019t die \u2014 it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn\u2019t destroy it \u2014 they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther\u2019s famous Theses. What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. The Protestants\u2019 Disgust With Indulgences So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let\u2019s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences \u2014 the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, \u201cAs soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs\u201d. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. \u201cJust follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.\u201d Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they\u2019re undeniable. In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that \u201cthis one simple trick\u201d is enough to guarantee an individual\u2019s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can\u2019t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It\u2019s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. Here\u2019s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn\u2019t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people \u2014 roughly the same size as the Catholic population \u2014 Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther\u2019s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one\u2019s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn\u2019t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. Dissent Breeds Dissent Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn\u2019t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it\u2019s simply a matter of survival. And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single \u201cProtestant\u201d dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as \u201cagainst\u201d the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as \u201cdoing what the Laser Eyes couldn\u2019t\u201d as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around \u201cowning the Laser Eyes\u201d. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? The JPEG People claim they are here to \u201cmake Bitcoin fun again\u201d, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to \u201cown the Laser Eyes\u201d. That doesn\u2019t produce anything of value. That doesn\u2019t actually inspire people with a vision. Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own. So what is the identity of the JPEG People without Laser Eyes to troll? Is there even one there when you take that away?

Regulators there are expected to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs in Asia this month, potentially adding more volume. ETF providers cite surging institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The funds present an easy vehicle for both retail and professional investors to gain bitcoin price exposure. The $200 billion cumulative volume indicates growing bitcoin's maturation since the last bull run when ETF hopes were repeatedly dashed.

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it\u2019s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they\u2019ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network. The Liquidity Crunch The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator\u2019s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. For now let\u2019s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they should have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they have processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users\u2019 money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? The Options The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. So now that we understand the problem let\u2019s look at some potential solutions. Throttling You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. The problem with this is you don\u2019t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don\u2019t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. Multiple Operators Both BitVM 1 and BitVM 2 support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator\u2019s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator. It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren\u2019t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. Multiple Linear Operators In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. The Backstop In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users\u2019 funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist. So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users\u2019 funds and make them whole. I don\u2019t think this is that bad. Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users\u2019 funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. Wrapping Up At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users\u2019 funds, to losing operators\u2019 funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I\u2019ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first.","article_summary":"An analysis of the recent criticism of BitVM based two way pegs published by Taproot Wizards.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-10T01:40:00Z","category":["opinion","bitvm","technical","bitvm 2","bitvm pegs"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"},{"article_title":"The U.S. Needs To Lead in Bitcoin, Says Congressman Patrick McHenry","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington DC today, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) emphasized the importance of the United States taking a leadership role in Bitcoin and not lagging behind in during a fireside chat with Club for Growth President David McIntosh.

Japanese Public Company Is Buying Bitcoin","author":"Vivek Sen","article_detailed_content":"Japanese firm Metaplanet announced it is purchasing 1 billion yen (about $6.5 million) worth of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, a move that mimics MicroStrategy's high-profile Bitcoin accumulation. Metaplanet, a publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a diversified enterprise, revealed the Bitcoin buying initiative on X. The company cited hedging risks from currency devaluation and inflation as motivations. The announcement said the purchase is an \"initial commitment\" and part of a broader embrace of Bitcoin's potential. Partners like legendary hedge fund manager Mark Yusko, UTXO Management, and Sora Ventures support it. By adopting a Bitcoin treasury reserve similar to MicroStrategy, Metaplanet aims to benefit from Bitcoin's upside while mitigating risks. MicroStrategy has pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, buying over $6 billion worth of BTC since 2020.

The move also provides Japanese investors indirect Bitcoin exposure without high unrealized gains taxes, which can reach 55% in Japan. Metaplanet's Bitcoin funds will be held in a tax-advantaged structure only accessible by the company. By buying Bitcoin, Metaplanet joins the growing list of public companies utilizing Bitcoin to maximize shareholder value. With MicroStrategy proving the model's effectiveness, more institutional adoption is likely. For Metaplanet, Bitcoin offers opportunities beyond investment gains like accelerating its Bitcoin initiatives. The announcement is a bullish sign for Bitcoin's traction in Asia.

Bitcoin Magazine is partnering with BPI to host a live stream of the event on its YouTube channel and social media platforms. With a lineup featuring politicians Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), Wiley Nickel (D-NC), Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), the summit is gearing up to be a nexus of Bitcoin and the political sphere in the United States. The participation of the aforementioned lawmakers underscores a clear bipartisan recognition of the importance of understanding and shaping the future of Bitcoin and digital asset policy work. Notably, Senators Lummis and Gillibrand have co-authored legislation in the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act. The bill, drafted in 2022, is a significant example of an emerging bipartisan effort to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Senator Gillibrand expressed her excitement for the upcoming summit, stating in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cAs a leader on this issue, I look forward to sharing my ideas and hearing from attendees on how we can write smart policy that allows for responsible innovation, has robust consumer protections, and enables us to root out bad actors.\u201d As the growth and economic integration of Bitcoin and digital assets continues, the summit's agenda reflects challenges and opportunities presented therein. Discussions will explore into the regulatory frameworks governing Bitcoin financial products and services as well as strategies to foster innovation while protecting civil liberties. \u201cAs a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I'm working to find common ground and advance common sense legislation on Bitcoin and crypto,\u201d said Congressman Wiley Nickel. \u201cI look forward to sharing an update on the work that we\u2019re doing and hoping to accomplish during the rest of the 118th Congress.\u201d Geopolitical considerations will take the stage in the \u201cGeopolitics of Bitcoin\u201d panel featuring SentinelOne Director Matthew Pines, BlockTrace Head of Operations Ken Egan, Bridger Solutions Co-founder and CEO Jake Langenkamp, and Foundry Vice President of Public Policy Kyle Schneps, as they analyze the implications of Bitcoin and digital assets for the dollar monetary system and global power dynamics. The summit will also examine the environmental and climate impacts of bitcoin mining operations. Panelists Troy Cross, a Professor at Reed College, and Brian Consolvo Partner at KPMG, are set to speak in a fireside chat: \u201cHow Institutions Consider Bitcoin\u2019s Sustainability\u201d. In addition, the use of geothermal energy will be a focal point as the Office Director for the Geothermal Technologies for the U.S. Department of Energy, Lauren Boyd, will also be hosted as a summit participant. \"The annual Bitcoin Policy Summit represents a unique opportunity for collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders from diverse backgrounds,\u201d stated David Zell, Founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute. \u201cBy fostering an inclusive conversation, we can develop informed and effective policies that support innovation while safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders.\" For more information about the annual Bitcoin Policy Summit, including the full agenda and list of speakers, visit BPI\u2019s website here.

One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. I really liked Dhruv\u2019s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows: Version 1: The Commonly Held View The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you\u2019d describe this is \u201c6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.\u201d Version 2: Dhruv\u2019s View ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term \u201creleased\u201d to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term \u201cunlocked\u201d for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv\u2019s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv\u2019s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. Why is Dhruv\u2019s framing important? By framing mining as buying coins rather than creating coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? If miners are creating bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an \"inefficiency of scale\" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *purchasing* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don\u2019t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. Layer zero is what I\u2019d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin that already exist to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn\u2019t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a \u201ctwo sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.\u201d The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price collectively for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers \u201cwins the auction\u201d using Dhruv\u2019s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES. The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, \u201cEach of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says \u2018what were the most recent bids in time?\u2019 and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.\u201d The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users and the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero? What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says \u201cit\u2019s computations for bitcoin.\u201d Layer 0 is a \u201cmarket between two aggregates.\u201d It\u2019s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two \u201cparticipants\u201d in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work. The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think \u201chow wasteful,\" think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv\u2019s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. There are some who believe that transaction costs won\u2019t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future.

This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything? If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. Verifying Things Yourself When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network\u2019s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network Most people likely don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s bitcoin payments, if you aren\u2019t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. The Supply Cap The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not the, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. Keeping Your Bitcoin Private Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else\u2019s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. Why This is All Important While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits. Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don\u2019t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else\u2019s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin\u2019s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it\u2019s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador\u2019s government uses Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, multiple defenses of Lightning\u2019s long-term viability as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network grew to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users\u2019 money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to question if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly quit the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes both the protocol\u2019s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, \u201ceveryone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people\u201d to Lightning, a \u201cmicroscopic\u201d amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, \u201calmost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it\u201d amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning\u2019s future prospects has emerged, as the network\u2019s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high. Source Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued optimism and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay secured $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes. This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase finalized a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange\u2019s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark\u2019s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to \u201cinscribe\u201d unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to inscribe discontinued video games. Download the full 20-page research report prepared by Tuur Demeester (Founder, Adamant Research) for Unchained. This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, claimed that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a \u201cvulnerability\u201d in Bitcoin, one that is being \u201cexploited... to spam the blockchain.\" The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been linked to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to \u201cfix\u201d this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals\u2019 continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance quoted their \u201congoing efforts to streamline product offerings\u201d as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning\u2019s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin\u2019s usability, while Ordinals\u2019 critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it\u2019s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr\u2019s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly rejected by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even endorsed Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a \u201crenaissance\u201d in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin\u2019s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain\u2019s flexibility and superiority over its competitors. Praise like this from such an important source could truly be groundbreaking. Events like this serve, more than anything, to prove once again that Bitcoin\u2019s spirit is not merely posed to disrupt established industries and build a more rational order on the wreckage. Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin\u2019s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It\u2019s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.","article_summary":"The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a \u201cdead end\u201d as capacity drops.

The halving (also known as the \u201cHalvening\u201d) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the \u201cblock subsidy\u201d) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain. The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin\u2019s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. . WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING? The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period \u2014 or epoch \u2014 will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE Determine the block interval: While it\u2019s true that Bitcoin\u2019s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments. Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you\u2019re running one. Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin\u2019s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height. Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving. Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected. Current block height: can be found here. Block time: can be found here. Current date: xx/xx/xxxx Blocks per epoch: 210,000 Next halving block height: 210,000 times next halving number Calculation: (((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it\u2019s important to keep running the calculation. HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS As of March 2024, there have been three Bitcoin halvings: On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. On July 9, 2016, the second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. On May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. BITCOIN HALVING 2012 The 2012 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s first halving. Halving: Date: November 28, 2012 Halving number: 01 Block height: 210,000 Block reward: 25 Mined supply: 10,500,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 5,250,000 Percentage of mined supply: 25% BITCOIN HALVING 2016 The 2016 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s second halving. Halving: Date: July 9, 2016 Halving number: 01 Block height: 420,000 Block reward: 12.5 Mined supply: 15,750,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 2,625,000 Percentage of mined supply: 12.5% BITCOIN HALVING 2020 The 2020 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s third halving.

Halving: Date: April 19, 2024 (estimated) Halving number: 04 Block height: 840,000 Block reward: 3.125 Mined supply: 19,687,500 (amount of bitcoin issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 656,250 Percentage of mined supply: 3.125% FUTURE BITCOIN HALVINGS The blocktime variable will introduce some variance in estimated halving dates, but it is possible to project approximate dates until the conclusion of block subsidies in 2140. Below, we provide a succinct overview of anticipated halving dates from 2024 to 2060, offering valuable insights into these upcoming milestones. Epoch Number Block height Halving Year Estimated Halving Date 04 (of 32) 840,000 2024 April 20, 2024 05 (of 32) 1,050,000 2028 2028 06 (of 32) 1,260,000 2032 2032 07 (of 32) 1,470,000 2036 2036 08 (of 32) 1,680,000 2040 2040 09 (of 32) 1,890,000 2044 2044 10 (of 32) 2,100,000 2048 2048 11 (of 32) 2,310,000 2052 2052 12 (of 32) 2,520,000 2056 2056 (cont\u2026) HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BITCOIN HALVING Halving events have consistently preceded significant increases in bitcoin\u2019s price, making them a focal point for market analysts. Price Appreciation Historically, bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced significant upswings following halving events due to the combination of reduced supply and increased demand. These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events. After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800. After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000. Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years. Challenges for Miners Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network\u2019s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin\u2019s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. FAQs: Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin\u2019s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it\u2019s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling. Is Bitcoin halving bullish? The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it\u2019s wise to remember that bitcoin\u2019s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak? A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. Should you buy bitcoin before the halving? Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it\u2019s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles.","article_summary":"As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway.

Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history. Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead. On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1 EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. As such, it\u2019s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners\u2019 interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it\u2019s the quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it\u2019s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody. Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there\u2019s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don\u2019t pay your taxes. For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again. However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on why FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR\u2019s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that \u201cwithout his New Deal, we would all have been lost.\u201d2 On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and \u201caccustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.\u201d3 All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is how FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. This is because, despite the fact that FDR\u2019s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America\u2019s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), \u201crule by personal decree\u201d4, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher. This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans\u2019 rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency \u201cNow, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes\u201d - Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses I\u2019m not sure anyone\u2019s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole not been Machiavellian enough, but in this case the historical record is clear. Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), \u2018disregarding the laws for good objects\u2019 has been practically a job requirement of the oval office. Carl Schmitt said that \u201cSovereign is he who decides on the exception.\u201d Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit \u2018extra-constitutional\u2019 exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt\u2019s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice. In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp. The phrase is \u201cnational emergency\u201d. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you\u2019re an American adult, it\u2019s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the \u2018anti-terrorism\u2019 provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19. In fact, it\u2019s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the \u2018national emergency\u2019 has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 National Emergencies Act. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.5 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States To give you a sense of the temporal nature of these \u2018emergencies\u2019, there are still in effect: 9 from the Obama administration, 10 from Bush II, 5 from Clinton, and even one from Jimmy Carter in 1979! This is what Milton Friedman was talking about when he said \u201cNothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.\u201d This is also the story of Executive Order 6102, for it too sprouted from an official national emergency. You can read this in order itself, where FDR states in the preamble: \u201cI, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist\u2026\u201d Executive Order 6102, 5 April 1933 But still, the story goes deeper. It\u2019s not just enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case in 1933. So what was FDR\u2019s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold? The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first. The Beginning: Principled Piracy In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia. About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the Rapid, to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the Jefferson, who claimed the ship\u2019s goods as a prize. Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the Jefferson. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.6 Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. \u201cBut\u201d, (I hear you interject), \u201cBy what definition could an \u2018American with gold\u2019 be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn\u2019t even a war in 1933!\u201d Fantastic points, and you\u2019re right to make them. To preface the answer, let\u2019s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major \u2018philosophies\u2019 that you might subscribe to. Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn\u2019t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these \u2018philosophies\u2019 help judges decide the \u2018right\u2019 way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that\u2019s another story). If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A \u2018Living Constitution\u2019 approach: where you basically say, \u2018to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today\u2019. The third approach is more or less how the law around \u2018national emergencies\u2019 has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate \u2018natural selection\u2019 evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast. So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. Now let\u2019s fill in the gaps and show how that happened. 1917: National Emergencies Go Up There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five. One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the Espionage Act, was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today. This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under. 1917 was also the first time the phrase \u201cnational emergency\u201d passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America\u2019s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.7 Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin\u2019 violation. This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since The Rapid, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle. The solution was the Trading with the Enemy Act, which brought the principle of The Rapid into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to \u201cdefine, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.\u201d8 In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.9 Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, \u201cperhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.\u201d10 This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives. For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.11 Source: New York Herald on March 28, 1918, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ This was all authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story. That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in \u201cforeign exchange\u201d, or by any foreign country.12 You might sense now that we\u2019re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness. But we\u2019re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President\u2019s power in 1917 was still limited to \u201cduring the time of war.\u201d13 It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it. Great Depression: FDR\u2019s Opportunity That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis. Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank\u2019s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would \u201cno longer take responsibility\u201d for the bank\u2019s \u201cdeficient reserves\u201d.14 What was going on? Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a \u2018gold standard\u2019 was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.15 The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country. However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government\u2019s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. Meanwhile, \u201call of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.\u201d16 FDR\u2019s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. He called out the \u201cunscrupulous money changers\u201d, and the \u201cfalsity of material wealth\u201d, and demanded that \u201cthere must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\u201d17 Now, if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a \u201cbroad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.\u201d18 It was all downhill from there. Two days after FDR\u2019s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a \u2018Bank Holiday\u2019 from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the \u201choarding\u201d.19 Stopping the run wasn\u2019t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting \u201cthe names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.\u201d20 On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate \u201cany transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.\u201d21 Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the Trading with the Enemy Act restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR\u2019s inaugural address, the Emergency Banking Act (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality. Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce \u201cduring time of war\u201d, or crucially, \u201cduring any other period of national emergency declared by the President.\u201d FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: \u201cHOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty\u201d22 This brings us to the end of the story. From The Rapid, to the Trading with the Enemy Act, to the Emergency Banking Act, to Executive Order 6102. The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn\u2019t. Conclusion: Could It Happen Again? Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin? Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes. The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn\u2019t control; Government wasn\u2019t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff. The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024. This isn\u2019t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either. The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. What does the next national emergency look like? A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities23 trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? We don\u2019t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate. In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of Alice in Wonderland\u2019s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff. Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a chance at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation. So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins. And see you in hell, FDR.

The regulator alleged that Sun \u201ctraveled extensively\u201d to the US while he and several companies carried out unregistered offers and sales of BTT and TRX tokens. According to the watchdog, Sun spent over 380 days in the US between 2017 and 2019 and made business trips to major cities, including New York City, Boston, Massachusetts, and San Francisco. He carried out the trips on behalf of the Tron Foundation and the BitTorrent Foundation \u2014 both of which are also named as defendants in the case. The SEC wants to use these trips to claim jurisdiction over Sun and the companies to pursue regulatory and legal action in the US. Wash trading The SEC alleged that Sun and the companies engaged in a wash trading scheme on the now-defunct crypto exchange Bittrex. Though the original complaint identified many of the same wash trading activities, it identified the exchange on which wash trading took place only as an unnamed \u201ctrading platform.\u201d The agency included the fact that Bittrex is based in the US alongside its other claims to personal jurisdiction over Sun and the other defendants. The amended complaint also alleges that Sun personally communicated with and provided documents to Bittrex circa 2018 to have the exchange list the TRX crypto. The documents link Sun to the other companies, and Sun personally signed some documents. Countering the request for dismissal The latest allegations address the concerns raised by Sun in his request to dismiss the SEC case in March due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Defense lawyers argued that Sun is a foreign national and not \u201cat home\u201d in the US and advanced similar arguments for the companies. The request for dismissal also identified the supposed improper distributions on Bittrex but said that \u201cthere is no allegation that any US resident purchased or attempted to purchase TRX on this unidentified platform, or that the effort to list TRX succeeded.\u201d The SEC sued Sun and the other defendants in March 2023. At the time, it primarily based personal jurisdiction claims around the allegation that sales focused on investors in the Southern District of New York and the allegation that celebrity promoters contacted individuals in the US via social media. The SEC separately sued Bittrex in April 2023 and settled the case in August 2023. The company halted operations globally in late 2023.

The report \u2014 called \u201cA Primer on Bitcoin Cross-Border Flows\u201d \u2014 sheds light on how the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is being leveraged to bypass traditional banking systems, especially in regions experiencing economic distress or strict capital controls. Necessary financial tool According to the IMF, residents of countries with restrictive financial regulations are turning to Bitcoin to move capital across borders more freely. The report highlighted significant transaction volumes originating from countries like Argentina and Venezuela, where citizens face hyperinflation and stringent financial controls. In these regions, Bitcoin has become a necessary financial tool for preserving wealth and accessing global markets rather than just a speculative investment. One of the report\u2019s authors, Eugenio Cerutti, wrote: \u201cBitcoin transactions provide a way for individuals in high-inflation countries to stabilize their savings and participate in global commerce on terms that aren\u2019t possible through their local currencies.\u201d However, the IMF report also cautioned against the potential risks associated with the widespread use of Bitcoin for cross-border flows. The lack of oversight and the anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies can complicate the efforts of regulators to monitor and control financial transactions to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering. On-chain volume The study reviewed both on-chain and off-chain transaction data to explore the trends behind Bitcoin\u2019s use across borders. It found that Bitcoin transactions are not only substantial in volume but also exhibit unique characteristics compared to traditional capital flows. Unlike typical foreign investments that are sensitive to economic indicators like currency strength, Bitcoin flows show a higher correlation with cryptocurrency-specific sentiments, such as market volatility and user sentiment indexes \u2014 like the Fear and Greed Index. The analysis also pointed out that on-chain Bitcoin transactions, which are recorded on the blockchain and offer more security, tend to be larger than off-chain transactions. This indicates that the robust security features of blockchain technology often protect larger financial stakes.

Scaramucci also predicted that Bitcoin will surpass the market capitalization of gold in the coming years as it matures as an asset class and the regulatory landscape becomes more accepting. Adoption curve He emphasized that Bitcoin might not stabilize as a reliable inflation hedge or store of value until it surpasses a billion users, which suggests continued volatility in the near term. \u201cBitcoin is on an adoption curve.

Former Blockchain Association member Jake Chervinsky called the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d on April 17. He warned that the bill would only permit centralized and custodial stablecoins. Chervinsky added that the proposed ban violates principles outlined in his testimony to Congress in 2023. He said in his testimony that legislators should focus on regulating custodial stablecoins and avoid regulating algorithmic stablecoins until further study. Aaron Day, Chairman and CEO of the Daylight Freedom Foundation and a Brownstone Institute fellow, also opposed the proposed ban on algorithmic stablecoins and asserted the bill would benefit banks rather than crypto. He argued that banks\u2019 involvement in stablecoins \u201csets the stage\u201d for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). However, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly said it has no intention to issue a CBDC due to the Fed Now system. Shift from FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett said the Lummis-Gillibrand bill initially did not include such harsh restrictions, based on her sources in Washington, DC. Terret said lawmakers aimed to reach \u201cmoderate positions on \u2026 contentious issues,\u201d including but not limited to the bill\u2019s proposed restrictions on algorithmic stablecoins. Her sources did not reveal why lawmakers shifted their initial perspective but said that all affected parties are \u201cnot particularly excited about the bill\u201d in its current state despite its nominally bipartisan support. The sources added that the bill is mainly a sign of growing pressure for stablecoin regulation in the Senate and an indirect attempt to have lawmakers engage in a separate stablecoin bill led by House Financial Services Committee chair Patrick McHenry. Bill bans unbacked stablecoins. One section of the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, as introduced on April 17, explicitly prohibits unbacked algorithmic stablecoins. The bill and its backing members do not describe any incident to justify the proposed ban. However, the collapse of Terraform Labs\u2019 algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD in May 2022 has likely played a role in the lawmakers\u2019 decision to include the prohibition in the legislation. The collapse \u2014 which wiped $80 billion in value from the crypto market in May 2022 \u2014 has raised concerns about algorithmic approaches to valuation \u2014 even as other competing algorithmic stablecoins such as Ampleforth (USDD), Frax (FRAX), and Ampleforth (AMPL) continue to circulate close to the value of the US dollar. Instead, the bill only permits depository institutions and non-depository trust institutions to issue stablecoins and does not set out a clear path to compliance for existing stablecoin firms. The bill also aims to prevent the illegal use of stablecoins and creates separate federal and state regulatory regimes, among other specific requirements.

This announcement was made during Wood\u2019s presentation on Polkadot\u2019s future at the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai. Web3 Foundation, the entity behind Polkadot, further announced a 10 Million DOT prize pool to foster diversity within the development of the JAM protocol. According to the firm: \u201cThe JAM Implementer\u2019s Prize is designed to catalyze this by funding and supporting projects that contribute to the development of JAM implementations from the outset.\u201d What is JAM? JAM is a decentralized hybrid system designed to offer secure and scalable smart contract functionalities. It combines certain features from Ethereum within Polkadot\u2019s architectural framework. Polkadot said: \u201cJAM is a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. It is a prospective path to replace the Relay Chain with a more modular, minimalistic design.\u201d Web3 Foundation added that JAM would allow Polkadot to run generic \u201cservices,\u201d smart contract logic to process the execution result on cores. A parachains service will run existing Substrate-based parachains, meaning developers can still use Substrate to develop and deploy their blockchains. In essence, JAM provides a global singleton permissionless object environment\u2014akin to Ethereum\u2019s smart-contract environment\u2014paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network. Goku, a supporter of the blockchain network, explained that the upgrade would allow Polkadot to become \u201ca true multi-core world computer capable of handling any type of service or app without scalability, security, or efficiency issues.\u201d He added: \u201c[Polkadot] has already become a multi-core processor, but this was limited to parachains. The idea is to generalize this even further, to be utterly unopinionated about what and how things are deployed, turning all parachains, aka rollups, into an application layer service, with Polkadot transforming into something akin to cloud service infrastructure.\u201d Meanwhile, the proposed upgrade would continue to utilize the network\u2019s DOT token. Following the news, the digital asset bucked its current downward trend to rise by around 3% to as high as $7. However, it has retraced to $6.62 as of press time. It should be noted that the JAM upgrade is still subject to Polkadot\u2019s community approval via the network\u2019s on-chain, decentralized governance.

With the next one just around the corner, how are miners behaving this time? Next Bitcoin Halving Is Less Than Two Days Away Now In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed Bitcoin miners\u2019 behavior in the build-up to the next Halving. The \u201cHalving\u201d is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the cryptocurrency\u2019s block rewards (the compensation miners receive for solving blocks) are permanently slashed in half. This event occurs approximately every four years, and according to NiceHash\u2019s countdown, the next one will occur in just over 32 hours. Bitcoin miners earn revenue from two sources: transaction fees and block rewards. Historically, the former has been quite low on the BTC network, so the miners primarily depend on the latter to pay off their running costs. Since the block rewards are cut in half during Halvings, these events naturally deal a significant blow to the miner\u2019s revenues. As such, it\u2019s not surprising that the miners have generally shown a reaction to the event in the past cycles. \u201cOne of the common dynamics that occur in every cycle of cutting the issuance of new BTC is the significant selling pressure exerted by miners,\u201d says the quant. One way to gauge the degree of selling pressure coming from these chain validators is via the Miner to Exchange Flow metric. This indicator tracks the total amount of Bitcoin moving from miner-associated addresses to wallets connected to centralized exchanges. As miners usually deposit Bitcoin to these platforms for selling, this flow can provide hints about their selling behavior. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) BTC Miner to Exchange Flow over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow had surged to high levels in the 2020 Halving event, implying that this group had potentially been participating in a selloff. This selling push may have come from the miners planning to exit, given the sharp revenue reduction that was set to occur. The graph, though, clearly shows that no such selling pressure has emerged this time around despite the event being just around the corner. So, what\u2019s going on here? The analyst suggests that the Bitcoin miners may have already completed the latest round of selling in advance (as the exchange inflows from the cohort did spike in February). If this is true, the quant thinks this could benefit the market in the short term. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move sideways inside a range recently, as its price is still trading around $63,500.","article_summary":"On-chain data shows Bitcoin miners have always sold as Halvings have occurred.

This price action has been unexpected and shows how the coin tends to go against predictions, basically charting its path. Bitcoin Breaking The Mold In light of Bitcoin\u2019s randomness, especially in the past few months following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one analyst expects the coin to continue defying expectations by clocking in a bull run that defies historical trends. The analyst cites two recent instances where Bitcoin defied expectations to justify this bullish outlook. First, following the rapid expansion in the 2020 to 2021 bull run that saw Bitcoin soar from less than $10,000 to fresh all-time highs of around $70,000, prices sharply contracted in 2022. Then, the United States Federal Reserve shifted its monetary policy to curb raging inflation by rapidly increasing interest rates. Following this and other market-related events, Bitcoin prices dipped below the all-time high of the previous cycle of $20,000. By November 2022, prices fell to as low as $15,000, accelerated by the collapse of FTX. This retest of previous highs and fall below $20,000 had never happened before. Another anomaly occurred last month. For the first time, Bitcoin prices expanded and broke the previous all-time highs of around $70,000 before the Halving event. As Bitcoin\u2019s past price action shows, prices only rally to fresh all-time highs after Halving. However, this changed when BTC soared to $73,800, possibly paving the way for bulls to join in and push the coin back to unchartered territory post-Halving. Is BTC Ready For A Multi-Year Rally? With this in mind, the analyst believes Bitcoin will continue uniquely shaping its path, deviating from history. For instance, the analyst thinks BTC will outperform altcoins in the coming months. The analyst adds that increased regulatory scrutiny following high-profile collapses like FTX and Luna could dampen altcoin enthusiasm. The coin will ride on the fact that it is the only one with an ETF from the United States SEC receiving investments. As a result of this capital injection, Bitcoin will likely register a multi-year \u201cup only\u201d phase, just like gold did once its ETF was approved. Prices remain depressed ahead of this.

Chainlink 30-Day MVRV Ratio Has Plunged In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the latest trend in Chainlink\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio. The \u201cMarket Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio\u201d is a popular on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between LINK\u2019s market cap and realized cap. The market cap naturally refers to the total valuation of the asset\u2019s circulating supply at the current spot price. In contrast, the realized cap is a different type of capitalization model that calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by instead taking the price at which each coin in circulation last moved on the network as its \u201ctrue\u201d value. Since the last transaction of any coin was probably the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would signify its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of every coin in circulation. In this view, the realized cap would be nothing but a measure of the total capital the investors have used to purchase the asset. In contrast, the market cap represents the value that they are holding right now. The MVRV ratio compares these two models, and its value can provide hints about whether the overall market holds more or less than it puts into Chainlink. In the context of the current topic, the 30-day version of this indicator is of focus, which restricts itself to only the investors who bought within the past month. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this LINK indicator over the past couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink 30-day MVRV ratio has recently taken a sharp plunge and dipped under the 0% mark. The 0% mark is where the market cap and realized cap are exactly equal, so below it, the latter would be greater than the former. When this is the case, the investors are carrying losses. This recent plunge into the negative has naturally come for the metric as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has plummeted, putting the 30-day buyers underwater. In the chart, Ali has highlighted a specific pattern that Chainlink appears to have followed regarding this indicator, plunging deep into the negative territory. \u201cEach time Chainlink MVRV 30-Day Ratio has dropped below -12.24% since August 2022, it\u2019s signaled a prime buying opportunity, averaging 50% returns!\u201d notes the analyst. Recently, the indicator has declined towards 17.54%, meaning it\u2019s below this level, which has historically led to profitable buying windows for the coin. It remains to be seen whether the pattern followed in the last two years will hold this time as well. LINK Price The past week has been terrible for Chainlink investors.

This unexpected profitability has raised questions about how a blockchain like Ethereum can be profitable. Ethereum Revenue Potential As noted in a recent analysis by the on-chain data platform Token Termina, the collection of transaction fees is a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s business model. All network users are required to pay fees in ETH when interacting with applications on the blockchain, which serves as an important source of revenue for Ethereum. Once transaction fees are paid, a portion of the ETH is burned and permanently removed from circulation. This process, commonly referred to as \u201cETH buyback,\u201d benefits existing ETH holders, as the reduction in supply increases the scarcity and value of the remaining ETH tokens. Thus, the daily burning of ETH contributes to the economic benefit of those holding Ethereum. In contrast to the burning of ETH, Ethereum also issues new ETH tokens as rewards to the network\u2019s validators for each new block added to the blockchain. These rewards are similar to traditional stock-based compensation and are designed to incentivize validators to secure and maintain the network\u2019s integrity. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that the issuance of new ETH tokens dilutes the holdings of existing ETH holders. According to Token Terminal, the difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders, essentially the Ethereum blockchain owners. This calculation allows for the determination of Ethereum\u2019s profitability on a day-to-day basis. Reduced Transaction Costs Drive $3.3 Billion Growth In addition to the overhauled revenue model implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, the launch of the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem at the end of the first quarter of 2024 brought significant changes, including the introduction of a revolutionary data storage system called blobs. This upgrade has reduced congestion on the Ethereum network and significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum (ABR), Polygon (MATIC), and Coinbase\u2019s Base. Implementing the Dencun upgrade, alongside the adoption of blobs and Layer 2 networks, has significantly impacted Ethereum\u2019s revenue. According to Token Terminal data, the blockchain\u2019s revenue has witnessed an 18% annualized increase, amounting to an impressive $3.3 billion. These revenue gains can be attributed to reduced transaction costs, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for users and developers. Despite the positive revenue growth, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of market corrections and dampened investor interest in the second quarter of 2024. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s revenue has declined by over 52%. This downturn can be attributed to the broader market dynamics and the temporary decrease in investor enthusiasm. Examining the data over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s market cap (fully diluted) has decreased by 15.2% to $358.47 billion. Similarly, the circulating market cap has declined by 15.2% to reach the same value. Additionally, the token trading volume over the past 30 days has declined 18.6%, totaling $586.14 billion. ETH is trading at $3,042, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether these changes and the reduction in fees will have the same effect in the second quarter of the year, and how this, coupled with a potential increase in trading volume, can push the ETH price to higher levels.

Based on Trend Rider\u2019s analysis, Cardano could rise to as high as $3 when this happens. Cardano To Rise To $3 If History Repeats Itself Trend Rider mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that if history repeats itself, Cardano might be on the brink of its \u201cultimate support test\u201d before it makes a parabolic move to the upside.

Ripple CEO Unveils 3-Year Growth Plan When inquired about the company\u2019s growth story for the next three years, Garlinghouse began by underscoring Ripple\u2019s significant international presence, with approximately 95% of its customer base located outside the US. \u201c95% of our customers are non US financial institutions,\u201d he stated. Furthermore, Garlinghouse explained that Ripple is selling payment solutions and custody solutions around blockchain and crypto. He emphasized the company\u2019s core offerings and conveyed a strong commitment to further expansion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep expanding, even though the US market, as we were talking about earlier, partly from a regulatory point of view, has been slow to adopt, the non-US market has been really, really strong for us. And we\u2019re going to be the infrastructure around all of that. That is our goal, and we think that opportunity is huge. We think that\u2019s going to be great for Ripple,\u201d Garlinghouse noted. In addition to infrastructure, Ripple plans to enhance the utility of XRP, the digital asset central to its payment protocol. Garlinghouse expressed a positive outlook for XRP, linking its success to Ripple\u2019s expansion and the broader adoption of its technologies. \u201cWe think that\u2019s going to be great for Ripple. We think it\u2019s going to be great for XRP,\u201d he said, reinforcing the symbiotic relationship between Ripple\u2019s growth and the adoption of its associated cryptocurrency. Garlinghouse then delved into the specifics of the upcoming US dollar-backed stablecoin, a pivotal development in Ripple\u2019s strategy to bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning sector of cryptocurrencies. He described the stablecoin as a response to the escalating demand within the stablecoin market, currently valued at $150 billion and potentially rising to over $2 trillion. \u201cRipple has always been about how do we bridge this new world with a traditional kind of, people call it TradFi, traditional finance,\u201d he explained. This stablecoin aims to provide a reliable and regulatory-compliant option in contrast to competitors like Tether, which is based outside of the US and faces different regulatory scrutiny. The initiative represents a strategic move to position Ripple as a leader in compliant, secure, and user-friendly crypto-finance solutions. \u201cI think that market is going to grow a lot. I think a US-based player who is compliance first has a great role to play,\u201d Garlinghouse added. Regulatory Environment And Advocacy For Clear Guidelines Garlinghouse also delved into the regulatory environment in the US, critiquing the slow pace of legislative progress which he believes hampers market growth. \u201cWashington is still trying to understand this market,\u201d he commented, expressing concern over potential legislation that might place undue barriers on the burgeoning crypto market. He was particularly critical of the current administration and regulatory figures, stating, \u201cThis administration, I think, has taken a pretty anti-crypto stance led by the SEC Gary Gensler as the chair has really doesn\u2019t understand it.\u201d He also challenged the narrative put forth by certain politicians, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who he quoted as saying, \u201cThe only people using crypto are bad actors.\u201d Garlinghouse concluded with a call to action for more informed, pro-innovation policies that align with fostering job creation and economic growth, reminiscent of the early days of the internet boom in Silicon Valley. \u201cThis is about leading the next wave of innovation,\u201d he affirmed, urging US policymakers to embrace and facilitate the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrency through clear and supportive regulations. Via X, he added: How pro-innovation policies in the US will prevail. Step 1 \u2013 replace the SEC leadership and step 2 \u2013 Elizabeth Warren\u2019s staff should read some actual facts on crypto instead of spewing constant misinformation.

According to prosecutors, Eisenberg, operating under a false identity, allegedly engaged in market manipulation to drive up the price of Mango\u2019s token, MNGO, and related contracts, ultimately exploiting an exchange feature to withdraw $110 million in cryptocurrency with no intention of repayment. Avi Eisenberg\u2019s Manipulation Scheme Exposed During the trial, prosecutors revealed that Eisenberg manipulated the price of MNGO tokens to deceive the system and acquire illicit funds. By \u201cartificially inflating\u201d the token\u2019s value, Eisenberg allegedly sought to perpetrate a deliberate fraud against Mango Markets. Assistant US Attorney Thomas Burnett emphasized Eisenberg\u2019s intent to \u201ctake the money and run,\u201d alleging that he meticulously planned and executed the fraud. Shortly after his significant financial gain, Eisenberg fled to Israel from Puerto Rico, where he resided. However, upon his return to Puerto Rico on December 26, 2022, US authorities arrested him. Eisenberg has remained in custody since then, as a judge deemed him a flight risk ahead of his trial. Prosecution Clash In Mango Markets\u2019 Fraud Trial During the trial, Eisenberg\u2019s defense attorney, Brian Klein, argued that his client had executed a legal trading strategy within the exchange\u2019s rules. Klein contended that Eisenberg had taken calculated risks within the confines of the smart contracts governing the decentralized finance platform. Furthermore, he highlighted the platform\u2019s disclaimer that warned users of the software\u2019s unaudited nature and associated risks. Assistant US Attorney Thomas Burnett countered the defense\u2019s argument, stating that the rules of the Mango Markets platform did not shield Eisenberg from prosecution for fraud and manipulation. Eisenberg did not testify during the trial, but he played an active role in his defense, taking notes throughout the testimony and frequently suggesting questions for his attorneys to ask the witnesses. Following Eisenberg\u2019s conviction, the price of the MNGO token has experienced a notable surge, reaching $0.029. This represents a notable 11.5% increase within the past 24 hours alone. In broader timeframes, contrasting the performance of the overall cryptocurrency market, MNGO has demonstrated significant gains of 69% and 46% over the past fourteen and thirty days, respectively. These figures indicate a renewed interest in the token after the exploit of the Mango Markets protocol. However, despite these recent gains, the MNGO token remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.49, achieved in September 2021. The current price reflects a decline of 94% from that peak level.

Here\u2019s what the whales are doing while the market panics. How The Bitcoin Whales Are Behaving At The Moment In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed how the Bitcoin whales have been behaving recently, given the struggle the asset\u2019s price has been going through. Whales popularly refer to BTC investors carrying at least 1,000 tokens in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth about $63.5 million. Due to this massive scale of holdings, the whales can influence the network. Thus, their behavior can naturally be worth following. First, the analytics firm has discussed the largest entities, even among the whales: the \u201cLarge Holders.\u201d IntoTheBlock categorizes Large Holders as those who own 0.1% or more of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply. Currently, almost 19.7 million tokens are in circulation, so these large holders would be those holding around 19,700 BTC, which is worth a whopping $1.25 billion. To track the behavior of the large holders, the analytics firm has referred to its \u201cLarge Holders Netflow\u201d metric, which uses on-chain data to track the net amount of BTC entering into or exiting the wallets of these humongous entities. Below is the chart for the indicator that shows how its value has changed over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Large Holders Netflow observed some notable positive spikes during March, suggesting that these massive investors had participated in the accumulation. The metric\u2019s value has recently stayed near the neutral level, with neither distribution nor accumulation showing any particular dominance. This would mean that the latest price drawdown hasn\u2019t been an enticing buy-the-dip opportunity for this cohort yet. The whales, though, have been buying at these recent low prices. The chart below shows the combined balance held by members of this group. As the graph shows, the Bitcoin whales made notable selling moves as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price rose to a new all-time high (ATH) last month. Following Bitcoin\u2019s drawdown from this ATH, though, the whales started buying again. As prices have gone lower recently, they have ramped up their rate of accumulation. IntoTheBlock said these investors had bought 16,300 BTC (almost $1.04 billion) over the past week. Overall, the fact that the whales are accumulating while the large holders have at least not been selling anything significant can perhaps provide a neutral to slightly bullish picture for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,400, down 10% over the past week.","article_summary":"Bitcoin has continued to struggle recently, and its price even briefly fell below $60,000.

Unlike the pre-halving sell-offs witnessed before the Halvings of 2016 and 2020, miners accumulate, going against previous trends. Miners Accumulating Bitcoin In a post on X, one analyst, while citing CryptoQuant data, notes that since the beginning of 2024, the total BTC balance held by miners has grown by a staggering 12,100 BTC, reaching a total of 217,000 BTC. This behavior starkly contrasts with what happened in 2016 and 2020 before the network slashed miner rewards. Then, reading from data, most miners were sizing down their holdings in anticipation of possible revenue slumps post-Halving. Halving is set at the protocol level and slashes miner block rewards by half, currently from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This way, miners would have to expend more resources to generate the same revenue they would have in the previous epoch. Accordingly, some small miners tend to liquidate and exit in anticipation of the rising competition. However, some large miners with more resources would take the opportunity to sell coins and buy more efficient miners to stay competitive. From the chart, miners continued offloading their BTC post-halving in 2016. However, even with increasing selling pressure, prices rose sharply in 2017, peaking at $20,000 before cooling off in 2018. As Bitcoin and crypto found adoption following the ICO mania of 2017, the scene became more liquid, and more miners participated, as seen from the rising hash rate post-halving. Unlike events in 2016, the 2020 halving marked a turning point. As Bitcoin prices skyrocketed towards record highs, miners adopted a holding strategy, rapidly accumulating coins, as the chart shows. This current accumulation trend suggests miners may anticipate a similar price surge. Is BTC Ready For A Bull Run To $100,000? This shift in miner behavior could positively impact prices. Miners, expected to readjust and become more efficient after April 19, are holding a vote of confidence even amid the current slump. Overall, a reduction in daily BTC emissions post-Halving, coupled with miners accumulating and institutions pouring in via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could propel prices even higher. The pace at which prices rise is yet to be seen. Bitcoin is bearish and remains under immense selling pressure following losses on April 13. A bullish breakout above the current range of $74,000 might be the base for more gains towards $100,000.","article_summary":"As the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event approaches on April 19, a fascinating trend is emerging among miners.

The arrests were made following an investigation into suspicious activities involving \u201cabnormally frequent\u201d and large transactions in bank accounts lacking tax records, import and export declarations, and physical addresses. Suspects Allegedly Used Tether During the probe, it was discovered that one of the accounts involved received significant daily deposits of up to HK$39 million ($4.9 million) and facilitated 167 transactions. Further examination revealed that two suspects allegedly handled HK$760 million, equivalent to 40% of the total funds, through a cryptocurrency platform, specifically Tether. Florence Yeung Yee-tak, commander of the Financial Investigation Division of the Customs Department, cited alleged challenges in investigating money laundering related to cryptocurrencies due to their anonymity and \u201clack of jurisdictional restrictions.\u201d Yee-tak emphasized that the enforcement team relied on intelligence, capital flow analysis, and financial investigations to gather evidence. In a coordinated operation, customs officers targeted four residences, five companies, and two licensed money service businesses before making the arrests. Trio Arrested For Laundering Billions In Crypto The trio, consisting of a 42-year-old woman and two men aged 48 and 60, allegedly set up five companies and opened 18 local bank accounts between June 2021 and July 2022. These companies were reportedly involved in over 1,000 suspicious transactions, receiving funds from undisclosed sources. Notably, the three arrested suspects did not know each other. The unemployed woman allegedly played a key role in the money laundering, receiving transfers from various companies and crypto exchanges. The funds were transferred to other companies or to the two male suspects through licensed money changers. According to the Customs and Excise Department, the woman managed HK$900 million of the illicit funds, while the 60-year-old driver handled HK$300 million, and the self-employed man dealt with HK$600 million. Investigations have revealed that the funds originated from a crypto exchange platform and over 200 local and overseas companies. The funds were rapidly transferred to other entities once deposited into the shell companies\u2019 bank accounts. The shell companies purportedly operated in mobile phone accessories, wholesale machinery, and vehicle parts. However, they engaged in business transactions unrelated to their stated sectors, including agricultural products and food, indicating their role as shell companies. The operation, code-named \u201cRacer,\u201d resulted in the seizure of mobile phones, company documents, stamps, and transaction records. Customs confirmed that the source and destination of the funds are still being investigated. Although the core members of the syndicate are believed to have been apprehended, customs authorities have not ruled out the possibility of further arrests. The three suspects were arrested on charges of conspiracy to deal with proceeds of an indictable offense, commonly known as money laundering. They have been released on bail but could face a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a HK$5 million fine if convicted.

Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses Have Aggressively Bought The Dip As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out, the total Bitcoin inflows going towards the accumulation addresses have set a new all-time high recently. The \u201caccumulation addresses\u201d here refer to wallets that have only a history of receiving transactions and never of sending. This means that these addresses have only purchased coins and have never participated in any selling. Besides this definition, fewer other restrictions exist for an address to be considered a part of this group. The wallet should have received at least two transfers (as only one transaction wouldn\u2019t be enough to set the trend one way or another), and its balance should be greater than 10 BTC. Even if they satisfy these conditions, miners and exchange-associated wallets are still excluded from the group, as they inherently compensate for the sell-side of cryptocurrency. The accumulation addresses are naturally the opposite of these entities, as these HODLers buy coins and lock them up in their relentless hands, thus effectively removing them from the circulating supply. There is also one final condition for an address to fall in this category: it must have seen its most recent transfer within the last seven years. Wallets older than this are thought to be lost because of missing keys or just being forgotten, so they don\u2019t exactly represent the voluntary HODLers of the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows going toward these accumulation addresses over the past year: As the above graph shows, Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses have recently achieved a new record. In this spike, 27,700 BTC ($1.75 billion at the current exchange rate) have flowed into the wallets of these perennial HODLers in a single day. The indicator\u2019s previous all-time high was witnessed a couple of months ago when the accumulation addresses purchased 25,100 BTC (almost $1.6 billion). The chart shows that this buying spree occurred during the rally, eventually resulting in BTC touching new highs. As such, the latest strong accumulation from these diamond hands may also be bullish for the asset\u2019s price. The chart also shows that the frequency and scale of large purchases from this cohort have been quite extraordinary in recent months. This trend could be explained by the bullish environment following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and their buying.

On-chain data shows an accumulation trend from this whale, with the latest being the acquisition of 300 million DOGE tokens worth $45 million at the current market price. These speculations have led to theories on who the whale buyer might be amidst a continued price decline for Dogecoin, with the most prominent hypothesis being billionaire Elon Musk. Whale Accumulating Dogecoin Dogecoin is currently on an extended price decline, with its price now down by 25.8% in the past seven days. However, on-chain data shows that a particular whale has been buying the dip, which is a testament to their strong belief in the cryptocurrency. Whale Alerts, a crypto whale transaction tracker, noted a DOGE accumulation from crypto exchange Robinhood into the private wallet \u201cDDuXGM\u201d amidst a flurry of other whale transactions in other cryptocurrencies. The transaction involved the movement of 150 million DOGE worth $23.5 million from Robinhood into the unknown wallet. It is interesting to note that a further investigation into the whale\u2019s on-chain activities reveals that this was not a one-time buy. The whale had acquired another 150 million and 30 million DOGE tokens worth $23.1 million and $4.8 million respectively in the hours before the last purchase. Elon Musk\u2019s tweets in the hours leading up to the purchase have only fueled speculation that he may be the whale. Just hours before, the billionaire tweeted a meme picture mentioning Dogecoin, which led to some speculations among investors. Musk has been a vocal proponent of Dogecoin for months, and his tweets are known to cause spikes in the price of DOGE. However, it is important to note that his recent tweet failed to do many wonders for the price of DOGE as the crypto continued on its month-lasting correction. At this point, there are more questions than answers about the mysterious $46 million Dogecoin purchase. Was it indeed Elon Musk or another whale quietly accumulating DOGE? At the time of writing, this whale address \u201cDDuXGM\u201d is holding 2.478 billion DOGE tokens worth $363.6 million. According to MartyParty, a prominent crypto influencer, the accumulation could be in response to a recent announcement from BITMAIN, a company producing crypto mining equipment. BITMAIN recently revealed its plans to expand support for DOGE mining after its Antiminer L9 release in May. Bitmain\u2019s Antiminer L9 model will support mining operations for Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bells (BEL), which are some of the still-existing proof-of-work blockchains. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.144, down by 8.15% in the past 24 hours. The significant price correction in the last day means Dogecoin is now in red in a monthly timeframe, and it is now down by 4.55% in the past 30 days.","article_summary":"Dogecoin is grabbing headlines and speculation from its wide community of investors after a recent whale accumulation from a crypto exchange.

This shift from its foundational principles could redefine Bitcoin\u2019s role in the financial landscape. One Huge Mining Powerhouse Since its inception by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin has been celebrated as a pioneering force for financial autonomy and freedom, free from the control of centralized financial institutions. However, recent developments suggest a departure from this ideal, steering Bitcoin towards what Stadelmann terms a \u201ccentralized paradox.\u201d One of the most significant indicators of this trend is the concentration of mining power within a handful of mining pools. Foundry USA and Antpool, for example, now control over 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total hashrate. This concentration is even more pronounced when considering that more than 80% of mining power is held by just five pools. Such dominance by a few undermines the decentralized nature that Bitcoin was supposed to exemplify. Distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s Network Hashrate. Source: Statista The influence of government and regulatory bodies also complicates the picture. For instance, North America\u2019s Blockseer pool not only meets but exceeds the US Government\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance standards. Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks? This compliance introduces a level of government oversight and control that was previously absent, diluting the decentralized promise of Bitcoin. \u201cIn short, a minority of miners control substantial resources, undermining the decentralized ethos that Bitcoin claims to uphold. This scenario questions the egalitarian nature that Bitcoin was purported to represent and opens discussions about the true beneficiaries of this digital currency,\u201d Stadelmann told BeInCrypto. American Institutions Take Over Stadelmann also believes that the growing engagement of major financial institutions in Bitcoin mining operations signals another shift towards centralization. BlackRock has acquired significant shares in two leading Bitcoin mining companies, 6.71% in Marathon Digital Holdings and 6.61% in Riot Blockchain, with investments nearing $383 million. Since 2014, Fidelity Group has been actively mining Bitcoin. On the other hand, Vanguard holds roughly 17.9 million shares in Riot Platforms and 17.5 million shares in Marathon Digital. This is not just about financial investment. In January, BlackRock further integrated Bitcoin into the mainstream financial market by filing documents with the SEC to include a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This new financial instrument now manages 272,800 BTC, valued at $17.20 billion. This figure does not even include holdings from similar products managed by other entities. \u201cThe increasing influence of these financial giants in Bitcoin mining operations could lead to a scenario where the decision-making and control over the network become concentrated in the hands of a few, rather than being distributed among a diverse group of participants,\u201d Stadelmann added. Bitcoin ETF Historical Holdings. Source: CryptoQuant The core of the problem lies in the stark contrast between Bitcoin\u2019s current trajectory and its original purpose. Bitcoin\u2019s original vision was to operate as a decentralized network, independent of traditional financial systems. However, increasing centralization might draw it closer to the very systems it aimed to circumvent.

Santiment Explains","author":"Bary Rahma","article_detailed_content":"In the days leading up to the Bitcoin halving, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant downturn, raising concerns about a potential bear market. Bitcoin saw a notable 19% price drop, while altcoins faced even steeper declines, with some plummeting by as much as 70%. This trend has sparked a debate among investors about the immediate future of cryptocurrencies as the halving approaches. Bitcoin and Altcoins Nosedive Before the Halving Historically, the Bitcoin halving \u2014 a scheduled reduction in the reward for mining new blocks \u2014 has been a catalyst for bullish market sentiment. The event effectively slashes the supply of new BTC, which in theory should increase the price if demand remains constant. However, Garry Kabankin, Market Analyst at Santiment, told BeInCrypto that the market does not operate solely on fundamentals, particularly in periods surrounding such significant events. The recent price corrections in Bitcoin and altcoins may reflect a natural market response to speculative anticipation, rather than fundamental declines in value. Indeed, the current market scenario reflects a speculative trading environment leading up to the halving. \u201cThe steep drop in altcoins, even more so than Bitcoin, underscores the heightened volatility and speculative trading that can precede such events. It\u2019s a reminder of the market\u2019s sensitivity to supply dynamics changes, where the reduced block reward post-halving can lead to expectations of decreased supply pressure,\u201d Kabankin explained. Kabankin explains that observing miner behavior, such as changes in miners\u2019 balance and total supply, can provide further insights. A decrease in miners selling their holdings pre-halving could suggest a bullish outlook, expecting higher prices post-event. Nevertheless, the true impact of the halving will only become clear in the weeks following. As the market adjusts to the new supply rate, its implications for Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and value can be understood.

Essentially, anticipation leads to speculative runs followed by corrections. However, Kabankin points out that given the current on-chain metrics and social sentiment, a nuanced view is necessary. \u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve seen euphoria around halvings, often leading to a reevaluation of positions post-event. It\u2019s crucial to monitor social sentiment and whale behavior for more immediate signs of market directio,\u201d Kabankin added. Moreover, the Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) ratio offers a clear view of market sentiment. It indicates whether the asset is over or undervalued at any given time. According to Kabankin, investors should also closely monitor the mean coin age. Significant drops can signal increased movement and potential selling pressure, hinting at broader market shifts. These indicators, combined with traditional support levels from technical analysis, can guide investors through uncertain times. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio. Source: Santiment Kabankin believes that to spot the potential resumption of a bull run, investors should pay attention to a blend of social sentiment and on-chain metrics. A decrease in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) coupled with an increase in fear of missing out (FOMO), often precedes market upswings. Furthermore, a significant uptick in stablecoin supply moving onto exchanges can signal readiness for buying action, hinting at bullish sentiment. Also, an increase in trading volume can indicate growing support for the trend. It may suggest a healthier buildup to a bull run. \u201cLooking at resistance barriers and on-chain signals is crucial for spotting potential turnarounds. One key metric to watch is the Mean Dollar Invested Age, especially when it starts decreasing, which can indicate that previously dormant tokens are moving, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment,\u201d Kabankin emphasized.

This move indicates Tether\u2019s intent to broaden its influence and diversify beyond its core stablecoin operations. Tether\u2019s New Focus on Tech and Education With its new framework, Tether is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. The Tether Data division will concentrate on strategic investments in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. Its partnerships with companies like Holepunch and investments in Northern Data Group highlight this focus on innovation. Simultaneously, Tether Finance will remain the hub for Tether\u2019s existing stablecoin products and financial services. The division aims to utilize blockchain technology to make global financial systems more inclusive. Moreover, its upcoming digital asset tokenization platform could play a role in wider digital asset adoption.

Tether Edu supports global access to digital skills, focusing on blockchain and P2P technologies. Its key initiatives include public-private partnerships and investments like Lugano\u2019s Plan B and the Academy of Digital Industries. Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, emphasized the company\u2019s innovative ethos in a recent statement. \u201cWith this evolution beyond our traditional stablecoin offerings, we are ready to build and support the invention and implementation of cutting-edge technology that removes the limitations of what\u2019s possible in this world,\u201d Ardoino said. This announcement comes when the regulatory environment for stablecoins is becoming more intricate. US senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand have recently proposed new legislation regulating stablecoins. The proposed bill, set for discussion in Congress next month, seeks to enhance consumer protection and preserve the integrity of the US dollar in digital finance. \u201cIt protects consumers by mandating one-to-one reserves, prohibiting algorithmic stablecoins, and requiring stablecoin issuers to comply with US anti-money laundering and sanctions rules,\u201d Senator Gillibrand remarked. Although Tether\u2019s stablecoin is not algorithmic, there are some allegations and concerns that USDT is being used for illicit activities, such as terrorism financing. USDT, being the biggest fish in the pond, frequently invites regulatory scrutiny. Read more: What Are Algorithmic Stablecoins? Stablecoin Market Dominance.

Although significant, it remains relatively mild by crypto standards. However, a more significant downturn would occur if the market descends to the golden ratio support level of around $1.45 trillion, essentially halving its value. Market Down 23% and Falling \u2013 What\u2019s Next? The cryptocurrency market has corrected approximately 23% thus far, breaching key support levels such as the 50-day EMA and the .382 Fib support at around $2.237 trillion. This development suggests the possibility of a further correction towards the next Fibonacci support zone, ranging between approximately $1.9 trillion and $1.96 trillion. A bullish rebound could occur upon reaching this support level, signaling a resumption of the upward trend. Alternatively, if the market continues to decline, the next significant support is expected around the 200-day EMA at approximately $1.856 trillion. Regarding indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram in the daily chart displays a bearish trend with downward ticks, accompanied by the bearish crossing of the MACD lines. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in neutral territory, providing no clear bullish or bearish signals.

A descent to the subsequent Fibonacci support level suggests a downside potential of approximately 11.6%, indicating a possible decline of more than 10% once again for the crypto market. This scenario could prompt altcoins to undergo a more pronounced correction. Moreover, the MACD lines are on the verge of forming a bearish crossover, while the MACD histogram has displayed bearish trends for three weeks. Crypto Market Cap chart.

Runes will go live after Bitcoin completes halving. This new framework enables the creation of altcoins directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature was once exclusive to networks like Ethereum and Solana. Runes Anticipation Spike Up Bitcoin Transaction Fees The buzz around Runes stems from the success of Rodarmor\u2019s previous project, the Ordinals protocol. Ordinals introduced NFT-like \u201cinscriptions\u201d to Bitcoin, infusing innovation and increased mining revenue into the community. However, this led to network congestion and higher transaction fees. As the launch approaches, its effects are already noticeable, with transaction fees on the Bitcoin network increasing dramatically. Fees have surged by over 45% in just one day and a staggering 892.7% compared to last year. This rise highlights the growing excitement and activity around the new protocol.

Bitcoin entrepreneur Dan Held describes this method as a \u201csimple strict improvement over BRC-20.\u201d \u201cRunes operations do not create a leftover useless UTXO. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that the market doesn\u2019t particularly care about technical improvements so I\u2019m glad that the market is hyped about Runes even if it\u2019s for speculative reasons and hopefully it results in a general improvement on the network,\u201d Held wrote. However, Runes also marks a major cultural shift within Bitcoin. Traditionally, Bitcoin has focused on its native cryptocurrency. Runes disrupt this by enabling the proliferation of various speculative altcoins on Bitcoin. Yet, the short-term success of Runes and its tokens is under scrutiny. Some analysts predict initial enthusiasm similar to the NFT boom, but concerns about sustained interest and value remain. DeFi researcher Ignas warns that real investment opportunities may only appear after the initial hype cools down. Ignas explains that the influx of Rune tokens could initially dilute trader attention and investment per token, potentially causing their novelty and value to diminish quickly.

The prohibition is not surprising, given China\u2019s restrictive stance on cryptocurrencies. Since the 2021 ban on trading and mining cryptocurrencies, Chinese traders have faced significant hurdles in accessing global crypto markets.

This follows after two high-ranking lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday to discuss the way forward. According to the initial report by Punchbowl News, the meeting was held in Schumer\u2019s office, shortly after the Japanese prime minister jointly addressed Congress the same day. Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters Keen on Stablecoin Reform Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have, so far, been very consistent in their bid to see the committee\u2019s stablecoin bill passed into law. So much so that their efforts played a huge part in the bill\u2019s passing at the House committee, albeit with a bipartisan vote. However, not much progress has been made since that passing, therefore blurring any hopes that the bill may be passed into law this year. First off, getting a floor vote in a House where there is ongoing infighting, especially among top Republicans, would be a difficult task. Also, the Senate Banking Committee hasn\u2019t lent any support or has shown any interest in the idea up until now. Despite these potential setbacks, however, McHenry and Waters are not willing to give up just yet. According to sources familiar with what was discussed on Thursday, the duo is looking to tie the stablecoin bill to a must-move item, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending bill. For McHenry, getting his panel\u2019s stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign into law is one of his priorities before retiring from Congress later this year. With Schumer now in the picture, there is a glimmer of hope that legislation that will guide issuers of stablecoins may just see the light of day. As of publication, efforts to reach out to McHenry and Waters for commentary have not yet yielded any results. Call for Cooperation Meanwhile, the meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a wake-up call for lawmakers around the world. It is an encouragement for them to double their efforts in advancing the stablecoin reform agenda. However, as the debate surrounding stablecoin regulation continues to gain traction, it will all boil down to the collective resolve of lawmakers to address regulatory uncertainties for this fast-evolving digital economy to attain success in the future. next US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform","article_summary":"Coinspeaker US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform Reps.

Throughout this week, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has shown strong volatility as we stare at Friday\u2019s Bitcoin options expiry. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6% up on the weekly chart at $70,922 with a market cap of $1.4 trillion. As per data from Greeks.live, a staggering 21,000 Bitcoin options are set to expire having a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put call ratio of 0.62. The max pain point for the expiry currently stands at $69,000. With the US CPI data and inflation coming higher than expected, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced stronger volatility. On the other hand, the implied volatility has declined which means that in the case of volatile price movements, the BTC price can tank further under $70,000. Furthermore, the Greeks.live data shows that the sell calls have dominated the Bitcoin trade over the past month and the optimism around Bitcoin halving seems to be waning. Also, with the slowdown in the Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC lacks enough impetus to continue with its rally ahead. As of now, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been largely consolidating in a tight range between $69,000-$71,000. Analysts believe that it could continue to consolidate up to halving without showing any major price movements. #BTC is still just consolidating between these two levels No major trend shift as we approach the Bitcoin Halving$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3nYdfEN9Sd pic.twitter.com/iaAQn27Tuj \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 11, 2024 Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $71,000 Over the last fortnight, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has faced a significant struggle moving past $71,000, clearly hinting at a strong bearish grip in the market. Critics speculate that the S&P 500\u2019s recent decline from its peak of 5265 on March 28 could foreshadow an economic downturn. Given Bitcoin\u2019s strong correlation with stocks, which surpassed 80% last month, its price might initially decline if market troubles persist. On the other hand, the BTC futures market continues to show signs of neutrality highlighting a healthy demand for leverage calls in comparison to the situation in March-end. However, any kind of excessive leverage remains a valid concern with the Bitcoin futures open interest currently standing at $34.3 billion. ⌛️🗣️ As #Bitcoin has now drawn to its final week before the #halving, social dominance toward the topic has peaked at its highest level of the year at 9pm UTC.

According to the report, the number of financing in the digital asset space increased by 50% in March to reach $1.6 million compared to February. The month witnessed a resurgence in institutional investments, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s climb to a new all-time high above $73,000 after a two-year downturn. Pushed by positive market sentiments, investors directed funds into 180 crypto projects across various sectors. Market Dynamics and Investment Trends The KuCoin research found a continuous growth trend in both the number and scale of investment and financing projects compared to the previous year. The company said the growth signals a robust revival in the primary investment market within the current crypto economy. While the financing scale between $10 and $100 million notably increased from 16.6% in February to 28.81% in March, seed-stage financing projects saw a slight decline from 40.86% to 37.8%. Despite this increase, strategic stage financing projects surged to 22.83% from 16.13%. Blockchain Performance and Investor Focus In terms of blockchain performance, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Polygon (MATIC) projects attracted substantial investor attention, especially following Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions after the Dencun upgrade. While Bitcoin and Polygon remained strong, Ethereum, through its layer-2 scaling solutions, topped the chart after the Dencun upgrade. For active venture capital companies participating in the crypto industry, OKX Ventures leads the way, emerging as the leader among other investors. The company participated in a total of 20 projects in March, followed by MH and Waterdrip. When it comes to the top ten sectors that received significant attention from venture capital, key sectors such as Infrastructure (Infra), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Games dominated venture capital investments. In March, investment institutions favored themes revolving around AI, DEX, and Lending projects. Market Momentum and Future Outlook March showcased a bullish trend for the entire crypto market, particularly propelled by Bitcoin\u2019s surge to new heights. On March 12, Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF recorded a new historical high for single-day net inflows, reaching $1.05 billion. With the Bitcoin ETF\u2019s historical inflow, the options and futures market saw significant Open Interest (OI) growth, reflecting an increased capital influx. However, a significant delivery in the options market on March 29 caused the OI to slide.

This new feature ensures the security and fairness of crypto transactions. The implementation of this solution is a direct response to user complaints about technical issues and hacking incidents, showing the wallet\u2019s commitment to improving the overall crypto experience for its large user base. MEV Protection coincides with an upgrade to Trust Wallet\u2019s Swaps feature, which now allows seamless exchanges with over 1 million token pairs across multiple networks and providers. This dual advancement showcases its dedication to facilitating secure swaps in the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding MEV and Its Impact Miner Extractable Value is a concept in the blockchain industry that refers to the potential profit miners, validators, and other participants can gain by manipulating the order, censorship, or insertion of transactions within a block. These attacks exploit this vulnerability, enabling malicious actors to manipulate transaction orders for personal gain. They result in increased slippage, less favorable execution prices, and an unfair trading experience for regular users. MEV Protection: A Comprehensive Solution The introduction of MEV Protection is aimed at countering this attack. The security measure safeguards users\u2019 swaps from front-running and sandwich attacks, which are common tactics used by bad actors in the crypto space. Front-running involves exploiting knowledge of a pending transaction to execute a similar transaction before it, thereby manipulating the market price. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, require trapping a legitimate transaction between two malicious ones to profit from price slippage. The MEV protocol ensures that users receive fair market prices for their swaps, protecting them from the risk of paying more or receiving less than the prevailing market rate. This feature benefits both experienced traders and those new to crypto, creating a safer and more secure environment for all swap participants. Easy Access to MEV Protection Accessing this new feature is a simple process. Users can select the swap option from the bottom menu, click on the settings button in the top right corner, and enable the MEV protection features. This will also make it available on all devices connected to the account, ensuring a seamless and secure trading experience and automatically opting users in for an additional layer of security from the beginning. This approach further showcases its commitment to transparency and providing a user-focused Web3 experience. In addition, the crypto wallet further places a strong emphasis on user education and empowerment, ensuring that its community is well-informed about the security measures that it has put in place. The introduction of this new development has received praise from the Trust Wallet community. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! Congratulations on adding MEV Protection. Now we can swap with peace of mind.

The training, done as part of the firm\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility is to help bolster law enforcement\u2019s understanding of blockchain technology, particularly as Hong Kong continues its push as the new darling of the crypto economy. According to a local media source, the training sessions were conducted for the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) and Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB). Web3 Companies and Authorities Jointly Fight Crypto Crimes With the increasing prominence of Hong Kong in the cryptocurrency space, Bitrace CEO Isabel says it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between Web3 companies and the authorities. She maintains that the training is targeted at equipping law enforcement officers with the necessary skills and knowledge to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes effectively. Isabel, while delivering a comprehensive overview of crypto-assets application in cybercrime, highlighted some challenges including the fact that regulatory agencies lag behind in understanding crypto-criminal methods. Many crypto crime fighters do not also know that encrypted crime investigation is usually multi-layered, and the low efficiency of collaboration among stakeholders. The Bitrace CEO insisted that it is necessary to protect the security of users\u2019 funds and foster a healthier and safer Web3 environment by strengthening partnerships with regulatory agencies. The capacity-building sessions delved into various aspects of crypto-related crimes such as online gambling, illicit asset trading, money laundering, and fraud. Last year, Anatoly Legkodymov, the former CEO of Bitzlato, pleaded guilty to facilitating the laundering of illicit funds totaling $700 million. Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace\u2019s technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities. Real-life case studies were analyzed to provide insights into encryption crime methods and the flow of criminal funds on the blockchain. Bitrace Capabilities Beyond Hong Kong Police Training Besides the training, Bitrace also engaged in discussions with the Commercial Crimes Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau. The aim is to foster collaboration between regulatory agencies and Web3 companies. Prior to the training, the regulatory authorities have tried to keep the space sane. For instance, last month, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong had flagged suspected crypto fraud with HKCEXP to prevent users from falling victim to scams. Analysts say Bitrace is well suited to provide capacity building for Hong Kong police as it has advanced analytics capabilities, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms and has enabled the accumulation of a vast address tag library. This library includes entity tags such as DeFi platforms, mining pools, and digital asset exchanges, as well as risk behavior tags like fraud, money laundering, and illegal online gambling. Thus, by utilizing this technology, regulatory authorities can swiftly identify suspicious addresses and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto transactions. Industry watchers hope that the collaboration addresses the challenges posed by crypto-related crimes. This is paramount as the Hong Kong SFC is set to green light spot Bitcoin ETFs in the region anything from now.next Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace's technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities.

While the outcome did not guarantee an outright ouster of the current sitting president, Yoon Suk Yeol, all indicators point to a one-term tenure ending in three years. Furthermore, the opposition\u2019s landslide victory has led to the resignation of Han Dong-hoon and Han Duck-soo as the party leader of the People Power Party (PPP) and Prime Minister respectively. Notably, South Korea\u2019s opposition parties jointly won 192 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. If the opposition parties managed to reach 200 seats, the current president would be impeached. Nonetheless, the remaining three years for the current president will be extremely difficult with the opposition controlling the National Assembly. What South Korea\u2019s Opposition Win Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets South Korea is one of the leading developed countries that have significantly adopted the web3 industry and digital assets. The high adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets in South Korea, amounting to over 6 million people, had a significant influence in the just concluded parliamentary election. Furthermore, both sides of the political aisle had promised reward packages for the cryptocurrency industry if elected in the country\u2019s National Assembly. On one side, the PPP had vowed to delay a digital asset tax and allow investors to thrive in the nascent sector. On the other hand, the Democratic Party pledged to allow South Korean investors to tap into spot Bitcoin ETFs both locally and overseas. JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea's pro-#Bitcoin Democratic Party has won the national election to form government. DP: \"We're going to allow the ETFs, domestic or overseas.\" More than 6 million South Koreans \u2014 over 10% of the population own Bitcoin or crypto. \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) April 11, 2024 Notably, the DP party will need to overhaul the country\u2019s securities regulator that previously indicated that brokering spot BTC ETFs violates the law. The arguments follow data that shows that South Korean investors purchased more than $200 million of MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR). Additionally, more investors from South Korea have been trading crypto futures ETFs. Meanwhile, it will remain a game of waiting to see if the president will bend to the National Assembly\u2019s rules and vice versa. Market Picture The cryptocurrency market remains in a macro bullish outlook with the Bitcoin halving 2024 about 9 days from happening. The fact that the United States has struggled to tame the dollar inflation is a direct reflection of the global economic situation. Furthermore, some countries led by El Salvador have been purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and global geopolitical instability. As Coinspeaker previously noted, the United States Federal Reserve only remains optimistic that interest rate cuts will take place later this year amid the upcoming general elections.

In a meeting, several state agencies called for regulating P2P crypto trading and digital asset purchases to protect people from financial loss. Thailand to Prevent Scammers from Cleaning Money via P2P Trades In attendance were representatives from several agencies, including the Defense Ministry, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, the Royal Thai Police, and the Bank of Thailand. Others were the Department of Special Investigation, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association, the Interior Ministry, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, and the Department of Special Investigation. The meeting was led by the Thai Minister for Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Jantararuangthong. The participants met following a recent order from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. The Prime Minister gave agencies 30 days to disclose plans to crack down on growing online fraud. According to a Bangkok Post publication, online scammers take the proceeds from their illicit activities and pass them through crypto exchanges and trading platforms via P2P trading. This helps to minimize the risk of being traced, making it difficult for authorities to find and prosecute scammers. According to Prasert\u2019s ministry, 80% of the 100 million baht ($2.7 million) worth of daily fraud recorded in Thailand passes through P2P channels. The ministry believes this is an easy way for fraudsters to clean the money because these fund transfers are unregulated. The Minister tasked the SEC with finding ways to regulate P2P trades to prevent money laundering. No VAT for Crypto in Thailand According to the SEC, there are 2 million crypto accounts held by individuals in Thailand. Current regulations focus on regulating crypto trading, especially targeting unauthorized exchanges. The new effort is to widen regulatory activities to ensure that P2P trading is scrutinized as part of current efforts. However, Prasert assures that registered platforms will not be targeted: \u201cThe move to regulate the P2P platform would not affect cryptocurrency traders on authorized exchanges.\u201d The Minister plans to offer a regulation scheme to the Prime Minister if the SEC cannot modify existing regulations. In addition to P2P trading, the agencies also hope to tackle online fraud and call center scams. Thailand is working on establishing the country as a digital asset hub. In February, the Ministry of Finance excluded crypto trading from value-added tax (VAT) requirements to encourage the use of digital assets. According to the Finance Minister\u2019s secretary, Paopoom Rojanasakul, the vision is to support crypto adoption to drive the digital economy. The ministry waived the 7% tax earlier imposed on the crypto sector, effective January 1. Initially, for authorized crypto exchanges, the waiver now extends to all brokers and dealers under the SEC\u2019s purview. For regulations, the SEC and Finance Ministry are currently modifying the country\u2019s 2019 Securities and Exchange Act.

Their critique covers a range of factors, including the involvement of venture capital (VC) investors and the issuance of separate tokens, as well as the centralized or federated structures that underpin some of these initiatives. The developer\u2019s concerns also extend to projects that offer reciprocal rewards based on user deposits, which they liken to pyramid schemes, and those that incentivize long-term lockups of coins, drawing comparisons to offerings like Hex. Additionally, he was skeptical of L2 platforms that lack comprehensive technical documentation, dismissing them as mere copies of the infamous Bitconnect scheme with a superficial disguise. In a post on X, they said: \u201cIf your Bitcoin L2 has no whitepaper or technical details, only 20 pages of documentation on how to deposit BTC and calculate your future yield, that\u2019s not your L2 that\u2019s Bitconnect wearing a false moustache.\u201d Echoing these concerns is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), who has openly questioned the effectiveness of Bitcoin\u2019s L2 solutions compared to the scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson argues that BTC\u2019s inherent design limitations make it incredibly challenging to implement additional functionality, often requiring the deployment of centralized or federated infrastructures \u2013 a compromise that, in his opinion, undermines the fundamental principles of the coin. The Optimist\u2019s Perspective: Envisioning Bitcoin\u2019s L2-Driven Future However, not all voices in the cryptosphere share this skepticism. Proponents of L2 technologies, like Yago, an X user with over twenty thousand followers, remain steadfast in his belief that these solutions will propel BTC to new heights, making it a cornerstone of modern civilization. He envisions a future where BTC becomes intertwined with various aspects of our lives, driven by the asset\u2019s increasing value as L2 implementations unlock new use cases and efficiencies. It is evident that both sides of the argument present strong and convincing opinions, stating the challenge of promoting new ideas while remaining true to the coin\u2019s commitment to decentralization, which has been the foundation of its success. The Layer 2 solutions offer the potential for the future of BTC by creating opportunities as the Bitcoin community continues to grow and generate innovative ideas. In recent times, we have witnessed a series of developments that have transformed the crypto space, such as AI-enhanced gaming in the crypto space and improved digital wallets that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and additional features for managing digital assets.

According to reports from on-chain analytics, an address linked to the $ONDO project deposited 200,000 $OMNI tokens into Coinbase just a few hours ago, amounting to approximately US$6.65 million. This address is believed to be affiliated with an early investment institution that holds interests in both the Ondo and Omni projects. Remarkably, this address received a distribution of 200,000 tokens from the $OMNI project only 18 hours prior, constituting 1.92% of the total tokens in circulation. Additionally, it acquired a significant amount of 144 million ONDO tokens from the Ondo project on January 18, 2024, equivalent to 1.92% of the total tokens in circulation (representing 10.39% of the total currency circulation). The close relationship between this institution and Coinbase is highlighted by its frequent large-scale deposits and withdrawals of ONDO tokens on the platform in recent months. The timing of this substantial deposit of OMNI tokens to Coinbase is notable, occurring shortly after the announcement of OMNI\u2019s launch. As the OMNI network token continues to face downward pressure, market observers are closely monitoring the implications of such significant on-chain activity.

Litecoin Price & Strategic Rebound Amid Market Volatility After a significant dip to a 45-day low, the Litecoin price has seen a strategic recovery, climbing back to the $78 mark. This rebound is driven mainly by investors leveraging the market dip, seizing the opportunity to buy in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving, which traditionally influences Litecoin prices positively. As geopolitical tensions influence markets, the Litecoin price strategically positions itself for potential gains. With Bitcoin halving just around the corner, the surge in Litecoin trading volume suggests a robust market response. Investors have shown resilience, pushing the Litecoin price toward an early rebound above $90.

This recovery aligns closely with market movements anticipating the Bitcoin halving, which has historically impacted related cryptocurrencies. Enthusiasts and investors are now eyeing the possibility of Dogwifhat reaching a new milestone, spurred by predictions of touching near the $10 mark post-halving. Amidst volatile market conditions, Dogwifhat\u2019s current stability has sparked discussions about it potentially setting a new all-time high.

A new contender is gearing up to join their ranks: Raboo (RABT). Fusing the magic of AI and memes, Raboo is considered to have 100x potential this year, and its presale is just getting underway. Let\u2019s explore these three tokens. Book of Meme: Documenting Web3 culture Book of Meme (BOME), a Solana-based gem, is revolutionizing Web3 culture by immortalizing meme content using IPFS\u2019s decentralized storage software. Book of Meme\u2019s BOME surged over 2,200% within a week of trading last month, marking it as March\u2019s hottest crypto. Most recently, Book of Meme has been integrated into Binance\u2019s crypto loans, a service offering overcollateralized loans for cryptocurrencies like USDT, BTC, and ETH.

Dogwifhat: Bountiful March could signal future gains Dogwifhat (WIF), a fresh twist on the iconic Doge meme built on the Solana blockchain, has quickly climbed the ranks in recent months. Like Book of Meme, Dogwifhat has been added to Binance\u2019s crypto loan, signaling its rising prominence among investors. March saw Dogwifhat\u2019s value soar by over 460%, propelling it to the status of the 3rd most valuable meme coin with a sizable $3.4 billion market cap. Despite a dip from a high of $4.64 to $3.27, this could merely be a set up for further gains. As Dogwifhat navigates these dynamic tides, the question remains: will another rally be enough to fend off competition from Raboo? Raboo: SocialFi pioneer with 100x potential As Book of Meme and Dogwifhat experience a downturn, Raboo (RABT) is fast gaining traction as this bull run\u2019s hottest crypto meme coin. Analysts are seeing bright things ahead for Raboo presale investors, forecasting a tremendous 233% return during its presale, with the potential for a 100x leap upon hitting major exchanges. Raboo is pioneering a SocialFi ecosystem where meme lovers can earn RABT tokens simply by creating and sharing memes. Using Raboo\u2019s cutting-edge generative AI, users can enter fun-packed contests to battle it out to craft the best memes\u2014all for a shot at some impressive awards.

Rumors suggest the presale, which started at a rock-bottom $0.003, might be snapped up in record time. Conclusion As Book of Meme and Dogwifhat cool off from their recent rallies, it\u2019s clear that Raboo might soon become the new market darling. AI, memes, and SocialFi are red-hot sectors right now, and Raboo is at the center of each of these bubbling areas. While the presale is just getting underway, it\u2019s unlikely to last long.

The Shiba Inu community has burnt over 774 million tokens in the past week. NuggetRush\u2019s crypto mining game integrates NFTs with blockchain gaming. Despite a 21.8% price drop over the last week, investors remain hopeful that the new update will resolve network congestion on the Solana network. The update is expected to bring a positive turnaround in the market for SOL. At the same time, the Shiba Inu community has burned over 774 million tokens in just one week. NuggetRush, meanwhile, has integrated some of the best NFTs into their new crypto mining game. The target is to offer its users a real-world gaming experience. NuggetRush (NUGX) raises excitement in the gaming space with NFTs NuggetRush (NUGX) is building a platform where players can assemble the best mining team to explore and mine precious minerals like gold, silver, and diamond. The platform has trending NFTs, which have different users on its gaming platform. Firstly, these NFTs serve as the characters of players and give them unique abilities. These unique abilities \u2013 speed, mining knowledge, and lots more add fun to the game, making it interesting. In addition to the NFTs acting as characters, there are some rare NFTs called RUSHGEMs. Fans have described them as the coolest NFTs, as they can be exchanged for real gold, making them one of the most searched NFTs in the game. Lastly, NFTs can be staked to receive a passive income of up to 20% APY. The amount earned as passive income will depend on the amount of stake and the duration of the stake. Whichever is the case, NuggetRush\u2019s NFTs are being hailed by some as the best NFTs to invest in. The NuggetRush airdrop for its NUGX token is less than a week from now, and investors are excited. The NUGX token, which will be listed at $0.020, could rise 50x after its listing this quarter, according to some chartists. Solana (SOL) price drops to lows at $120 Solana (SOL) price has been on a steep decline in the past week, dropping 21.8% to $124.69. The \u201cEthereum killer\u201d was greatly affected by the latest bear market and issues of failed transactions on its network. Meanwhile, Anza, the development team behind Solana, has launched a new update, v1.17.31, to solve the issue of network congestion. While this is not a major fix, the team said it would release other updates to complete the issue. With this update, we should see positive momentum returning to the Solana ecosystem in the coming days. If this happens, bulls could take SOL to the long-awaited $250 mark. Shiba Inu (SHIB) community burns 774M SHIB Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a rapid increase in its token burn rates. Data from Shibburn shows that over 774 million SHIB tokens were burnt in the last week. This is an increase of nearly 200%. Despite this uptick in burn rates, the circulating supply of the meme coin still stands at 582.80 trillion SHIB. Additionally, Shiba Inu, like many other top altcoins, is still trading in losses. The coin\u2019s price has gone down 24.0% in the past week. Its price could increase in the coming days if positive momentum returns to the market. Final thoughts Solana investors are expecting the new update to bring a positive wave to the SOL token. On the other hand, Shiba Inu\u2019s massive token burn did not affect its price.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui\u2019s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.\u201d Users can read more on the event on the Sui Blog.

BONK slumps 32% in a week, but analysts foresee a resurgence by month\u2019s end. Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ attracts more investors after surging 85% during its presale. Top crypto coins like Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) have recorded double-digit losses over the second week of April as the crypto market continues bleeding. As a result, a growing number of investors are migrating to Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ token, which has surged 85% so far during its ongoing public presale. Why is $RECQ outpacing popular cryptos like SUI and BONK? Continue reading to find out. SUI plummets 33% in a week: will bulls resurface soon? SUI has performed deplorably over the past seven days. On April 7, SUI was changing hands at around $1.65. After a day of range-bound trading, the token rose slightly on April 8 following the announcement of Suilend completing its beta phase, becoming publicly available. Notably, Suilend hit a $30 million TVL during its beta phase, which started on March 11. This news saw SUI jump to as high as $1.72 on April 9. However, the excitement about this news cooled off, and the price began correcting downward. By April 14, the token had stabilized at around $1.10. This price means SUI has shed 33.33% in a week and the subpar performance explains why many investors are abandoning the token. Still, some experts believe SUI will overcome the current bearish trend and climb to $1.91 by the end of April. This forecast could make SUI a good crypto to buy now. Experts base this prediction on SUI gaining more adoption as more Web3 gamers line up to purchase the SuiPlay0X1 handheld gaming device, which SUI introduced on April 10. BONK wipes off 32% in a week: will bears persist? BONK has performed abysmally over the past seven days. On April 7, BONK was hovering around $0.00002317. After a day of sideways trading, BONK gained traction on April 8 after AllDomains announced the number of registered .LetsBONK domain names had exceeded 10,000. This milestone saw BONK jump as high as $0.00002452 on April 8. BONK held this level for a day before the excitement about AllDomain news faded. Consequently, BONK began retracing its growth. By April 14, BONK had leveled off at around $0.00001561. This price means SUI has plunged 32.63% in a week. This lackluster performance has left investors asking, is BONK a top crypto to invest in? According to some experts, BONK could reverse course and jump to $0.00001800 by the end of April. Experts base this prediction on BONK gaining more adoption after the BONK team announced that BONK adopters had locked over 3 trillion BONK on ArmadaFi as of April 12. Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ steals the show after jumping 85% Rebel Satoshi, an upcoming meme coin project, has emerged as the latest sensation in the crypto industry due to its mission to fight centralization. Investors are buzzing about Rebel Satoshi because its mission entails uniting the silent majority and building a vibrant community that champions decentralization. A number of analysts have suggested Rebel Satoshi might be the best ICO to invest in right now because it boasts two tokens, namely $RBLZ and $RECQ. $RBLZ is Rebel SatoshI\u2019s governance and membership token, while $RECQ is its base currency. Interestingly, $RBLZ rewarded Early Bird Round investors of its presale with a 150% ROI. As of April, $RBLZ was available on Coinstore, CoinGecko, Uniswap, and DEXTools. On the other hand, $RECQ had kickstarted Stage 1 of its ongoing public presale. During this round, investors can purchase $RECQ at $0.0037. This price denotes an 85% surge from the Early Bird Round $RECQ price of $0.0020. It is worth pointing out that Rebel Satoshi has set $RECQ\u2019s launch price at $0.0125. When $RECQ attains this price, Early Bird Round investors will get a 525% ROI, while Stage 1 investors will enjoy an ROI of 237.84%.

The discussion provided an in-depth look at the anticipated developments and strategic directions for the crypto industry in the upcoming year. Vugar Usi Zade highlighted the critical importance of prioritizing end-user experiences and privacy, drawing lessons from historical challenges such as the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data scandal. He stressed the necessity for industry leaders to work closely with regulators to enhance user protection without stifling innovation. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that legislation supports the growth of blockchain technologies rather than hindering it,\u201d Usi Zade noted. \u201cAs key players, centralized exchanges should work with legislators and educate them on how blockchain technology works and how introducing legislation should help the end user.\u201d Addressing the infrastructure of the gig economy and energy sectors, Usi Zade shared insights about Bitget\u2019s initiatives to support the integration of blockchain technologies in various industries. \u201cWe are particularly excited about our projects that give NFTs a second chance and promote sustainable energy practices among communities,\u201d he added. A significant focus for Bitget in the coming years, as outlined by Usi Zade, will be on developing and nurturing talent within the blockchain sector. He emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to invest in entrepreneurial innovation on its platform. \u201cWe believe in empowering new talent to build and develop rather than trying to do everything ourselves,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are so many opportunities, and we need so much talent, for the entire economy and industry. In the next two years, we will invest as many resources as possible to develop talent.\u201d With an exemplary track record of safety, Bitget underscores its pledge to user security through substantial financial safeguards, including a robust protection fund. \u201cWe maintain a 200% proof of reserve, ensuring that funds remain secure even if all users withdraw their assets simultaneously.\u201d Usi Zade asserted. \u201cWe have security measures in place, but in case something goes wrong, we have an insured Protection Fund to make sure that there are no customers suffering at the other end.\u201d The Bitget COO emphasized that its Protection Fund is one of the largest in the industry, providing an additional layer of security against potential breaches. Usi Zade also discussed the role of centralized exchanges in facilitating access to the crypto market. He described how Bitget has simplified the transition for users from traditional finance to cryptocurrencies through user-friendly services like social logins and comprehensive customer support. The COO concluded his talk by touching upon the regulatory challenges and the potential of decentralized exchanges to evolve further. \u201cAs legislation in Europe begins to affect how users can transact with non-KYC wallets, centralized exchanges will need to adapt. However, this also presents an opportunity to redefine our roles, potentially acting as intermediaries in large B2B transactions,\u201d he speculated. The panel discussion at Blockchain Life Week 2024 provided much-needed insights into the crypto industry\u2019s expected trajectory. It also reinforced Bitget\u2019s position as a leader prepared to navigate and shape the future landscape of digital currencies.

It was the first conviction in a cryptocurrency market manipulation case. Jail Time Ahead He is now facing substantial prison time: the commodities fraud count and the commodities manipulation count against him each carry a maximum imprisonment of 10 years, while the count of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of up to 20 years. His sentencing is scheduled for July 29. \u201cThis ground-breaking prosecution epitomizes this office\u2019s ability to employ innovative methods and cutting-edge law enforcement tools to continue to protect all financial markets,\u201d US Attorney Damian Williams said. A $110 Million Heist In October 2022, Eisenberg used two accounts to sell a large number of perpetual contracts of Mango\u2019s crypto token MNGO from one of his accounts to the other, thus artificially inflating the price by 1,300 percent in under an hour. He then used the token as collateral to borrow $110 million in other cryptocurrencies from Mango Markets and quickly withdrew the funds. In doing so, he essentially withdrew all the cryptocurrencies deposited on the DeFi platform. Later, he negotiated a settlement with Mango Markets and agreed to return $67 million to the decentralized autonomous organization governing the protocol. He was arrested in December 2022 in Puerto Rico. In court, the defense lawyers tried to convince the jury that Eisenberg\u2019s trades on Mango Markets were \u201csuccessful and legal\u201d and \u201cfully complied\u201d with the decentralized protocol\u2019s scant rules. However, the jury sided with the prosecutors' portrayal of it as a \u201cbrazen\u201d fraud and manipulation. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission also brought civil fraud and market manipulation charges against Eisenberg. \u201cManipulative trading puts our financial markets and investors at risk,\u201d the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Nicole Argentieri, said. \u201cThis prosecution, the first involving the manipulation of cryptocurrency through open-market trades, demonstrates the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to protecting U.S. financial markets and holding wrongdoers accountable, no matter what mechanism they use to commit manipulation and fraud.\u201d This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"A federal jury in New York yesterday (Thursday) convicted Avraham 'Avi' Eisenberg, a crypto trader, for fraud and market manipulation in carrying out a $110 million heist from the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Mango Markets.

In an interview with Bloomberg TV, the CEO of JPMorgan labeled the leading digital asset a \"fraud\" and \"Ponzi Scheme.\" According to Dimon, Bitcoin lacks the fundamental qualities necessary to function as a currency. Dimon Labels Bitcoin \"Ponzi Scheme\" \"Crypto, if you mean crypto like Bitcoin, I've always said it's a fraud. If they think there is a currency, there's no hope for it. It's a Ponzi scheme, it is a public decentralized Ponzi scheme,\" Dimon mentioned. He dismissed Bitcoin as merely a speculative asset, saying those who view it as a legitimate form of money are misguided. Despite acknowledging Bitcoin's role in modern financial markets, Dimon does not believe that the token has the potential to function as a currency. Throughout the years, he has consistently expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, citing concerns about volatility and the lack of regulation. Despite the growing acceptance of the asset by mainstream institutions, Dimon's stance has not changed.

He likened it to a \"pet rock,\" CNBC reported. His comments echoed similar sentiments he expressed in 2021 and the previous year in Davos, terming Bitcoin as \"worthless\" and a \"hyped-up fraud.\" However, Dimon's remarks highlighted a distinction between blockchain technology and Bitcoin. Perspective on Smart Contracts Dimon acknowledged the practical applications of blockchain technology in facilitating efficient transactions and data transfer. He is optimistic about smart contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum, which facilitate the execution of financial transactions without the need for intermediaries. Jamie Dimon on the cryptocurrency industry: \"I'd close it down\" https://t.co/vimnFywEjk \u2014 CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) December 10, 2023 In his latest remarks with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said: \"If it's a crypto coin that can do something like, you know, a smart contract that has value, there will be smart contracts and blockchain works.\" Dimon's latest comments arrived a day before the most important event in the Bitcoin blockchain: Bitcoin halving. This event occurs approximately every four years and cuts the rewards for Bitcoin miners by half. Currently, the cryptocurrency world is excited about the upcoming halving, especially with recent developments like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Jamie Dimon recently affirmed his longstanding stance against Bitcoin. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, the CEO of JPMorgan labeled the leading digital asset a \"fraud\" and \"Ponzi Scheme.\" According to Dimon, Bitcoin lacks the fundamental qualities necessary to function as a currency. Dimon Labels Bitcoin \"Ponzi Scheme\" \"Crypto, if you mean crypto like Bitcoin, I've always said it's a fraud. If they think there is a currency, there's no hope for it. It's a Ponzi scheme, it is a public decentralized Ponzi scheme,\" Dimon mentioned. He dismissed Bitcoin as merely a speculative asset, saying those who view it as a legitimate form of money are misguided. Despite acknowledging Bitcoin's role in modern financial markets, Dimon does not believe that the token has the potential to function as a currency. Throughout the years, he has consistently expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, citing concerns about volatility and the lack of regulation. Despite the growing acceptance of the asset by mainstream institutions, Dimon's stance has not changed.

He likened it to a \"pet rock,\" CNBC reported. His comments echoed similar sentiments he expressed in 2021 and the previous year in Davos, terming Bitcoin as \"worthless\" and a \"hyped-up fraud.\" However, Dimon's remarks highlighted a distinction between blockchain technology and Bitcoin.

The era of opaque interest rates, surprise fees, and the ever-present threat of late payment penalties might be nearing its end. At least, that's the promise Klarna is making with its US debut of the Klarna Card, a new financial instrument aiming to be the smarter, smoother way to shop and pay. Klarna, the Swedish buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) giant, has already carved a niche for itself in the payments industry. Their model lets consumers split purchases into installments, typically interest-free, offering a more controlled alternative to traditional credit cards. Now, with the Klarna Card, they're taking things a step further. This physical and virtual Visa card integrates seamlessly with the Klarna app, allowing users to not only manage payments but also shop for the best deals and track spending in one centralized location. But what truly sets the Klarna Card apart is its commitment to transparency. No more buried fees lurking in the fine print \u2013 Klarna boasts zero annual fees, no monthly fees, and even waives foreign transaction fees for international purchases. This focus on upfront clarity is a welcome change in an industry notorious for its hidden costs. The traditional credit card model has long been criticized for its tendency to encourage impulsive spending and rack up debt. Klarna counters this by promoting responsible financial behavior. The Klarna Card operates on a debit system, meaning users can only spend what they have available. Additionally, it offers a variety of flexible payment options, empowering users to choose how they want to manage their purchases. They can opt to pay their statement in full each month to avoid interest charges, make early payments to chip away at larger purchases, or split eligible transactions into 3 or 6 installments with interest. This level of control allows users to tailor their repayment strategy to their unique financial situation. This focus on responsible spending is underscored by Klarna's data. They report that a significantly lower percentage of their BNPL users incur late fees compared to traditional credit card users. This suggests that the Klarna model, with its emphasis on transparency and control, might be nudging users towards healthier financial habits. Of course, the Klarna Card isn't a magic bullet. Approval requires meeting eligibility criteria, including a credit check. For those who qualify, however, the Klarna Card presents a compelling alternative. It offers the convenience and security of a traditional credit card, with the added benefits of transparency, flexibility, and the potential for rewards through the Klarna app. The Klarna Card's arrival in the US throws down a gauntlet to established credit card companies. Consumers are increasingly demanding more from their financial tools, and Klarna is stepping up to deliver. Whether this new entrant will disrupt the status quo remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Klarna Card injects a dose of competition into the payments industry, which can only benefit consumers seeking smarter ways to manage their money.

Now, with the Klarna Card, they're taking things a step further. This physical and virtual Visa card integrates seamlessly with the Klarna app, allowing users to not only manage payments but also shop for the best deals and track spending in one centralized location. But what truly sets the Klarna Card apart is its commitment to transparency. No more buried fees lurking in the fine print \u2013 Klarna boasts zero annual fees, no monthly fees, and even waives foreign transaction fees for international purchases. This focus on upfront clarity is a welcome change in an industry notorious for its hidden costs. The traditional credit card model has long been criticized for its tendency to encourage impulsive spending and rack up debt. Klarna counters this by promoting responsible financial behavior. The Klarna Card operates on a debit system, meaning users can only spend what they have available. Additionally, it offers a variety of flexible payment options, empowering users to choose how they want to manage their purchases. They can opt to pay their statement in full each month to avoid interest charges, make early payments to chip away at larger purchases, or split eligible transactions into 3 or 6 installments with interest. This level of control allows users to tailor their repayment strategy to their unique financial situation. This focus on responsible spending is underscored by Klarna's data. They report that a significantly lower percentage of their BNPL users incur late fees compared to traditional credit card users. This suggests that the Klarna model, with its emphasis on transparency and control, might be nudging users towards healthier financial habits. Of course, the Klarna Card isn't a magic bullet. Approval requires meeting eligibility criteria, including a credit check. For those who qualify, however, the Klarna Card presents a compelling alternative. It offers the convenience and security of a traditional credit card, with the added benefits of transparency, flexibility, and the potential for rewards through the Klarna app. The Klarna Card's arrival in the US throws down a gauntlet to established credit card companies. Consumers are increasingly demanding more from their financial tools, and Klarna is stepping up to deliver. Whether this new entrant will disrupt the status quo remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Klarna Card injects a dose of competition into the payments industry, which can only benefit consumers seeking smarter ways to manage their money.

This wasn't just another transfer of funds; it was the first payment conducted using the ISO 20022 messaging format, a standardized language poised to streamline the symphony of international finance.

Where barriers to entry once stood, technological advancements are making it possible for anyone to access wealth-creation opportunities that were once the domain of the elite few. At the forefront of this transformation is the emergence of tokens, specifically those that represent real-world assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and others. By reimagining ownership and trading of assets, tokenization is unlocking doors to financial opportunities previously out of reach to many. This shift is not just altering market dynamics, it's laying the foundation for a more equitable and accessible financial future when empowerment and freedom aren't just ideals but tangible realities. Investing in Appreciating Assets - an Economic Necessity The ability to invest capital into assets, instead of holding cash, is not a luxury but a necessity for every household looking to survive and thrive. Holding cash, often perceived as a safe bet, is a silent thief eroded by the relentless march of inflation. Consider this, $100 in 2004, sitting idly, would have the purchasing power of merely $60 today. Contrast this, with the dynamism of the stock market the same amount invested in the S&P 500 over the same period would have quintupled to an impressive $470. Yet, the landscape of stock ownership reveals a stark imbalance. The wealthiest 10% in the US control an overwhelming 93% of stocks, illustrating a deep-seated inequality in financial opportunity and access. This inequality is magnified when looking at sectors like private equity and private credit, where doors often remain closed to everyday investors. Enter Tokenization, the Great Equalizer While a distinctly counter-culture ethos characterized the early days of blockchain, it wasn\u2019t long before traditional financial institutions sought to leverage this technology to improve existing financial pipelines. Thus began the race to tokenize the world and empower traditional assets like stock, bonds, and real estate with the benefits of blockchain, such as 24/7/365 trading, fractional ownership, transparency, and programmability. \u201cThe most important first step is to get in there and start to engage in the ecosystem\u201d\u2014Sandy Kaul of @FTI_Global.How banks and asset managers can get started with tokenization ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/kG2MdNrUdv \u2014 Chainlink (@chainlink) April 17, 2024 Yet, perhaps the greatest advantage of the tokenization of traditional asset classes is the ability to encourage retail participation. Take the Republic Note, for example, a digital asset representing the Republic\u2019s private equity portfolio of over 600 companies, including SpaceX, Maven, and Gumroad. All retail investors have to do to gain exposure to the portfolio is sign up for INX.One, the trading platform where the Republic Note trades 24/7/365. Such a privilege was unthinkable in the pre-tokenization era. The Tokenization Market Is Huge The total addressable market for tokenization is huge, with hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of real-world assets waiting to come on chain. According to Boston Consulting Group, the tokenized asset market is projected to grow to a staggering $16 trillion by 2030. We are still in the early stages of this transformation, with only about 0.03% of the total market size currently captured. At this low level of market penetration, a golden opportunity presents itself to innovative asset managers, institutions, and investors who wish to position themselves on the cusp of a new financial era. #HSBC to Expand Tokenized Asset Offerings \u2014 CEO Says He's 'Very Comfortable' With #Tokenization https://t.co/mjFwfPN7Fw \u2014 Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) April 16, 2024 However, navigating this evolving landscape is not without its challenges.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui (https://sui.io/) is an industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\" said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui\u2019s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.\u201d This article was written by FM Contributors at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Over 1,000 projects, partners, investors, and enthusiasts from 65 countries around the world gathered last week in Paris to celebrate Sui at the vaunted Layer 1\u2019s inaugural global Sui Basecamp conference.

In 2023, the company handled about GBP 6 billion in payment volume and generated about EUR 5 million in revenue. Neo is headquartered in Barcelona, with offices in the United Kingdom. Interestingly, the UK is also a significant market for the company as about 40 percent of its clients are from there, while others are primarily from Western European countries. The company is presently expanding beyond the European markets and has sizable operations in Canada with plans to expand to Singapore.

Although the ripple effect of SVB's collapse did not reach Europe, customers have become cautious. \u201cCompanies need to diversify their banking partners,\u201d the CEO of Neo added. \u201cThe diversification strategy was used to be true for credit, but I would say it should be for operational purposes.\u201d \u201cWe believe that this is a trend that every company should follow and not rely on one partner.

Of course, that doesn't mean you will lose your money, but it may mean that your money is blocked somewhere or isn\u2019t received by whoever you are trying to pay.\u201d \u201cThat's why you need to work with payment partners who are extremely well connected to the network and have access to the tools to track the payments and ensure that information leveling is correctly done.\u201d Pointing at the challenges of the payment providers, Descout added: \u201cYou need to build your payment corridors very carefully. There is no point in having a fast solution if, on the receiving side or the issuing side, the quality of the exchange and the liquidity are not there.\u201d He further believes there will be \u201cchallenges in the coming years around interconnectivity of clearing systems.\u201d \u201cThe interconnectivity of major clearing systems, and in some cases more local ones, will drive a lot of changes because it's becoming more and more doable to collect monies somewhere and pay somewhere else. I think that will bring many interesting things ahead in terms of international services and definitely for crypto payments supports.\u201d Revolut got a banking licence in Mexico.

We are required to collect more and more information as a payment institution to analyze more and more information on payment changes, which are complex as sometimes we don't even see the entire payment change.\u201d \u201cAI is bringing a lot of analytics capabilities, and we can look at thousands of transactions and spot anomalies, which may trigger some questioning or some analysis all in a couple of seconds.

Of course, that doesn't mean you will lose your money, but it may mean that your money is blocked somewhere or isn\u2019t received by whoever you are trying to pay.\u201d \u201cThat's why you need to work with payment partners who are extremely well connected to the network and have access to the tools to track the payments and ensure that information leveling is correctly done.\u201d Pointing at the challenges of the payment providers, Descout added: \u201cYou need to build your payment corridors very carefully. There is no point in having a fast solution if, on the receiving side or the issuing side, the quality of the exchange and the liquidity are not there.\u201d He further believes there will be \u201cchallenges in the coming years around interconnectivity of clearing systems.\u201d \u201cThe interconnectivity of major clearing systems, and in some cases more local ones, will drive a lot of changes because it's becoming more and more doable to collect monies somewhere and pay somewhere else. I think that will bring many interesting things ahead in terms of international services and definitely for crypto payments supports.\u201d Revolut got a banking licence in Mexico. What does that mean for Fintech? Cross-border is so hot right now. My take 👇Revolut has secured a banking institution licence from Mexico's National Banking and Securities Commission and aims to gain a share of the cross-border payments\u2026 \u2014 Simon Taylor (@sytaylor) April 11, 2024 \u201cAI Is Bringing a Lot of Analytics Capabilities\u201d Like other industries, artificial intelligence (AI) impacts payment flows. And, according to Descout, AI is \u201calready transforming\u201d the payments industry. \u201cThe main advantage of AI now is going to be on the compliance side of things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are, as a payment company, bound by strict regulations. We are required to collect more and more information as a payment institution to analyze more and more information on payment changes, which are complex as sometimes we don't even see the entire payment change.\u201d \u201cAI is bringing a lot of analytics capabilities, and we can look at thousands of transactions and spot anomalies, which may trigger some questioning or some analysis all in a couple of seconds. AI is definitely going to transform the compliance side of our business, making payments quicker and services better.\u201d This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.","guid":"https://www.financemagnates.com//executives/interview/many-payments-firms-are-already-using-stablecoins-neos-ceo","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-18T20:40:00Z","category":["interviews","executives"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://www.financemagnates.com//executives/interview/many-payments-firms-are-already-using-stablecoins-neos-ceo/","website_source":"financemagnates"},{"article_title":"Tanssi Foundation Announces 'Let\u2019s Forkin' Dance'","author":"FM Contributors","article_detailed_content":"The Tanssi Foundation, a key contributor to the development of Tanssi's community and ecosystem, has unveiled \"Let\u2019s Forkin' Dance,\" the Tanssi Incentivized TestNet campaign. This initiative is designed to incentivize participants and propel community growth and network activity in preparation for the upcoming Tanssi Network launch later this year. Backed by leading investors like Arrington Capital, HashKey Capital, Fenbushi, Borderless, The Wormhole Cross-Chain Fund, KR1, YBB, SNZ Capital, and Scytale Digital, alongside angel investors such as Gavin Wood, Tanssi is at the forefront of reinventing the deployment of application-specific blockchains (appchains). These appchains play a crucial role in creating decentralized, user-centric applications. Traditionally, deploying appchains has been cumbersome and time-consuming, often forcing developers to settle for less secure and centralized alternatives. Tanssi's protocol aims to simplify this process to just a few clicks, significantly reducing deployment times from months to minutes. In just six months since its launch, Dancebox, Tanssi's TestNet, has supported over 700 appchain deployments in fields such as DeFi, NFTs, real-world assets, and gaming, showing rapid market adoption. This major step toward the official launch of the Tanssi Network showcases the vibrant activity anticipated once the network is live, inviting everyone to actively participate in the ecosystem.

TRON Overview Tron Market Statistics TRON Price History As seen on the Tron chart, the price of Tron cryptocurrency has seen a good amount of volatility over the past years. After spending the second half of 2019 retracing from $0.04, TRX eventually found support around the exchange rate of $0.11. This resulted in a push higher at the beginning of 2020 as the price set a new higher high, indicating that a new bull cycle has potentially begun. However, after peaking at $0.026 in the middle of February 2020, the Tron price got heavily rejected to the downside, destroying any bullish price prediction at the time. What followed for the price of crypto was another dump lower. The Tron price pushed through previous support and set a new several-year low at $0.07. The price started to slowly recover from there on, creating a bullish Tron (TRX) price action structure by the end of the year. In September, the Tron price moved and saw a very sharp spike to the upside, resulting in a brief breakout from the significant resistance of $0.04 as it hit a new several-year high of $0.05. During the following weeks, the crypto retraced toward the previous resistance of $0.22-$0.025 and retested it as support. As expected by analysis of several well-known traders at the time, Tron\u2019s price reversed from thereon. After spending the end of 2020 in a consolidation, Tron pushed higher at the beginning of February in a solid bull run, resulting in a $0.065 level being reached, beating several predictions.

With the reversal in the trend, the coin price has changed its bearish outlook as it is trading above the 50-day and 100-day MA, breaking out of the upper end of the Bollinger Band. Developments affecting the TRX Price The price took a sudden hit of 7% when, on December 17, Justin Sun announced that he had been appointed as Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization, and would be stepping back from TRON. As a result, the TRON Foundation has said it has \u201csettled to dissolve itself on July 25, 2022\u201d. Despite this, the Tron (TRX) price still keeps going up. Could it be that the strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in the DeFine social NFT platform is finally bearing fruits? The funding will be used to develop the first NFT marketplace in the TRON ecosystem and launch auctions soon. Or could it be that the network\u2019s BTFS file storage system (was integrated with DeFine in September? Or TRON\u2019s expansion into the NFT ecosystem with APENFT is operating successfully? Or was some other strategy hatched by Justin Sun? Now, let\u2019s look at the long-term Tron price prediction for the upcoming years and remember that these Tron price predictions are not investment advice. More on the Tron Network What Is Tron (TRX)? Tron (TRX) was created by tech entrepreneur Justin Sun in 2017. The TRON project funds were raised through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with a subscription of funds reaching 70 million. This was one of the largest ICOs and increased cryptocurrency popularity even further. Today, Tron has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies with over $5.4 billion in capitalization, while the 24-hour trading volume exceeds $250 million. At first, TRX ran on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 blockchain as it offered a quick and easy solution for running the peer-to-peer network. Later on, the developers of Tron switched the blockchain to their custom-made solution. The blockchain used proof of stake mining and validation consensus algorithm and was one of the first cryptocurrency projects to implement this solution. One of the primary use cases and benefits of the TRX platform is the support for content creators and artists by providing ownership over the content they create. This is done by storing and tracking the information about created content and its use on the blockchain. Therefore, content creators can directly track how their creations are used and their reward for producing them. The middleman is eliminated, and content creators get paid instantly. TRON Ecosystem Applications Some of the core applications that the TRON ecosystem aims to provide include: Wallet-Cli: Wallet-Cli is the official wallet client provided by the TRON foundation. Further, Wallet-Cli is a command-line version of the wallet that provides essential tools to communicate with the TRON public chain by RPC protocol. RPC protocol stands for remote procedure call, an inter-process communication technique used for point-to-point communication between software applications. Wallet-Cli supports all functions of the TRON public chain in real-time. TronLink: TronLink is a TRON wallet that provides users with a convenient experience, complete functions, and secure funding options. Blockchain Explorer: The first blockchain explorer based on TRON is tronscan.org, which offers essential functions like searching transactions, accounts, blocks, nodes, smart contracts, token creation, and more. DApp: TRON public chain aims to attract a vast community of developers to join in the development, deployment, and running of DApps on the blockchain because of their high performance, low cost, and safety. Tron Foundation The Tron foundation is the governing body of the Tron blockchain. They aim to popularise and further develop the blockchain. Based in Singapore, they ensure that the TRX blockchain is regulated and complies with laws. Tron, Justin Sun, is still the Tron foundation leader and is listed in the Forbes list of 30 under 30 in Asia. In 2018, a popular peer-to-peer torrent-sharing network \u2013 BitTorrent, announced that the TRON Foundation had acquired them to use TRX tokens to incentivize and reward network users. This created massive interest for the token, and it soon exceeded a $1 billion cap. Several other projects and development phases have since been launched, with the most notable ones being the Odyssey, which created a system for incentivizing content creators. Further development phases \u2013 Great Voyage and Apollo-enable content creators to build their brands and issue personalized initial coin offerings to raise funds for their projects. Plans to develop the ecosystem align with Star-Trek and Eternity phases. Star-Trek is set to launch in mid-2023, and Eternity in late 2025. Therefore, we will probably see interest in Tron and blockchain itself grow even further in the upcoming years and increase the price. Let\u2019s look at Tron\u2019s previous price history to understand what the future price could look like. It is a good investment if you rapidly lose money in all others. Tron has been compared with Ethereum due to its lower fees and fast payment. When ETH was at its all-time high, a considerable amount of fees was applicable for transfer, and for this reason, people started shifting to TRON. What other factors affect the TRX price? Tron celebrated the most significant milestones in its existence, surpassing a million active user accounts. But since then, a lot has changed because the total number of active user accounts surpassed 4 million, and it is flourishing. Moving forward, in the first week of June 2021, there have been more than 10 million transactions recorded on the Tron blockchain. On June 14, it recorded a total of 1,049,206 transactions. That is almost triple the number of transactions recorded daily on the Bitcoin blockchain. Factors affecting Tron\u2019s price are the same as any other cryptocurrency \u2013 mainly, the supply and demand on cryptocurrency exchanges. More significant deals are often done off the exchanges, creating a negligible impact on the Tron price. Supply and Demand The coin supply naturally comes from the number of tokens released into the market every day. In the case of Tron, you can earn a mining reward by staking the coin. As of now, staking TRX offers around a 7 percent annual yield. However, this yield will vary over time and based on market conditions. On the other hand, the demand for Tron comes from investors who want to buy it with the expectation that its long-term value will grow. Another motivation for purchasing Tron is the ability to stake your coins, giving you an annual yield. Staking TRX tokens also gives the power to vote on various issues that the network developers want to solve or features that they want to add. Therefore, by purchasing and staking TRX, you help ensure the TRX blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism. Regulatory Compliance Recently rumors of the United States and China investigating the TRON Foundation and the blockchain itself. In his Twitter account, the founder of Tron Network, Justin Sun, ensured no reasons to doubt the accusations of malpractice as the network is run as a decentralized network. Therefore, claims of centralized manipulation are of no sense since the TRON Foundation is only one of several thousands of participants. Overall, TRX is compliant with various global regulations as any other major blockchain. This ensures the demand for TRX continues growing. Therefore, over time, the crypto market price should continue to rise over the next five years. The Rise of DApps Over the last months, the TRX network experienced an increased interest in decentralized applications (DApps). As of now, more than 100 DApps are running on the blockchain, offering various categories of functionality ranging from exchanges to gaming and gambling. Websites such as DappRadar offer a quick overview of the most popular ones and how many users have each decentralized application attracted over time. User count ranges from several hundred to several thousand, and this number is expected to grow further over the next 5-year period. This raised interest in the TRX blockchain functionality, which created an additional appeal to invest in Tron. Therefore, creating extra trading volume and market growth for the cryptocurrency market. Where to buy Tron? Tron is available for trading on practically every major exchange, just like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is one of the best-known cryptocurrencies, with a high average trading volume of more than $2 billion per day. As seen during previous bull markets of cryptocurrencies, this number is likely to grow over the next five years. Therefore purchasing crypto shouldn\u2019t be an issue for anyone interested in trading or investing. How to store Tron? Tron offers several options for storing crypto. The basic one is the so-called TRON paper wallet, which involves a primary method of printing out your private keys and keeping them on a piece of paper in a place to which only you have access. This basic solution comes from earlier cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Other options include Tron Android wallet, Tron IOS wallet, Chrome wallet, Exodus desktop wallet, and the commonly used hardware wallets of Ledger Nano and Trezor. This means that the Tron coin can be stored in as many different wallet options as other well-established cryptos, such as Ethereum. TRON DAO introduced a development fund to support blockchain projects focused on AI. With AI technology gaining increased attention and experiencing growth, especially within the cryptocurrency sector, TRON DAO seeks to expedite this trend through its latest $100 million fund. It is anticipated that TRON will soon position itself at the top list of dominating the payment sector, significantly pushing TRX\u2019s price to the North. Not long ago, TRON\u2019s stablecoin USDD depegged from $1 and traded at $0.97, which built up a strong negative sentiment in the TRON community with an extended bearish consolidation ahead in the TRX price graph. However, the development team seems promising as it looks for several ways to revive the ecosystem with great enhancements to the network. It is advised to do your own research and conduct good investment advice before investing in the highly volatile market. TRON has evolved the blockchain space to a new era as it focuses on developing the foundation of a decentralized global ecosystem, which is a crucial sector of the crypto space. TRON coin is a highly-rated cryptocurrency with massive potential for widespread adoption in the future. Much of these expectations are due to the strategic partnerships continuously secured by the TRON ecosystem in a bid to promote awareness of the platform. An example of such partnerships is the recent collaboration with the Republic of Dominica, in which the TRON platform will be used to create fan tokens known as Dominica Coins (DMC), which serve to promote the country\u2019s national and cultural heritage. The Tron ecosystem is rapidly growing with new users and dApps. This results from the robustness, scalability, and low cost of the blockchain. As we transition into WEB 3, we anticipate new industry players to plug into the Tron blockchain, like Samsung. Furthermore, the TRON network continues to attract numerous developers and users with its high throughput and low transaction fees. On the first of September, Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, announced the network had hit a new milestone, recording a total transfer value of over $5 trillion since its launch in 2018. Tron has weathered its investors from this year\u2019s crypto winter, and due to its high utility, it will be highly profitable in the following market bull run. The shaky performance of Tron USDD stablecoin will adversely affect Tron\u2019s performance in the case of a crash. Many Tron opponents and Ethereum proponents have long believed that Tron is not legitimate crypto. They have speculated on the legitimacy of Tron as a company in general after Tron openly admitted that it is going after Ethereum. ETH is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. However, crypto enthusiasts think that the two projects cannot be compared. They are different since the ETH developers wrote their code from scratch, while Tron might have copied and improved the code. Nonetheless, Sun said that the Tron blockchain code was written from scratch and originally in Chinese, the main thing going for TRX. TRON may soon make a bullish reversal as the developing team is actively looking for valuable opportunities to bring to the TRX platform. If the demand for TRX stays stable or increases, and supply remains constant, TRON crypto may see a price increase in the future. With the Tron Foundation out of the way, TRX will be one of the most decentralized cryptos and can shoot up to a high of $3.05 with an average forecast price of $2.56 by 2032. You have to trade and hold TRX for a long time before getting rich due to its volatility. Most TRON price predictions consider TRX a favorable asset for long-term investment, capable of delivering steady profits over the years. The future prices of TRON will majorly depend on the crypto market\u2019s favorability to make it a good investment option. That said, these price predictions are not guaranteed, as various factors can influence cryptocurrency market prices. Thus, investors are advised to consult with financial market experts before making investment decisions. By reading your favorite coins\u2019 price analysis and daily roundups, you may keep yourself updated and better able to make a decision.","article_summary":"Tron Price Prediction 2024-2033 TRX, or rather Tronix, is the native crypto asset of the TRON Network.

The future profitability of BNB hinges on the expansion of the Binance ecosystem, regulatory developments, and further widespread adoption.

BNB\u2019s role as a key asset in the cryptocurrency space is likely to grow as blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies continue to gain adoption. Our Binance Coin price forecast section provides analysis on the profitability of the coin in the coming years. Recent News/Opinion on BNB Concerns Arise: BNB Chain\u2019s Fee Surge Amidst User Decline The BNB Chain has witnessed a significant increase in daily transaction fees and revenue, reaching its highest levels so far in 2024. However, this spike comes alongside a notable drop in user activity on the network, raising concerns about economic sustainability, centralization risks, and potential market manipulation. While bullish sentiment surrounds BNB\u2019s price, it\u2019s essential to scrutinize the underlying factors driving these metrics to ensure the long-term health and resilience of the ecosystem.

Binance and CEO CZ Fined $2.7 Billion in CFTC Verdict for Money Laundering Charges. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has imposed fines of $2.7 billion on Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and $150 million on its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The penalties stem from allegations of violating US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, with Binance accused of facilitating over 100,000 suspicious transactions, including those linked to terrorist groups and illegal content. CZ stepped down as CEO in November, pleading guilty to anti-money laundering law violations. The fines highlight regulators\u2019 efforts to enforce anti-money laundering regulations in the cryptocurrency sector, as Binance aims to rebuild trust under new leadership led by CEO Richard Teng. Judge Rules Binance Founder Must Stay in U.S. for Sentencing. A federal judge in Seattle has ruled that Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, must remain in the U.S. pending sentencing for money laundering charges. The decision overturned a previous ruling allowing Zhao to return to the UAE. The judge expressed concerns about Zhao being a flight risk despite a substantial bond, citing the belief that his vast wealth, mostly held overseas, might incentivize him to forfeit the bond for freedom. The case involves allegations of Binance ignoring criminal transactions, resulting in one of the largest corporate fines in U.S. history. Zhao faces a maximum of 18 months in prison, and both Binance and Zhao have agreed to substantial settlements.

BNB Overview Popularity #4 Market Cap $47,470,827,649 Price Change (24 hours) -1.51% Trading Volume (24 hours) $735,309,465 Price Change (7 days) 4.48% Circulating Supply 149,545,260 BNB All-time low (Aug, 2017) $0.09611 All-time high (Oct, 2017) $690.93 Price from ATL +329954.81% Price from ATH -54.09% BNB Price History Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB\u2019s price saw a significant increase, aligning with the overall cryptocurrency market boom, and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB\u2019s price experienced gradual growth. A key development during this period was the launch of Binance Chain in April 2019, which introduced Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange. This led to BNB reaching new highs, going above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. This was partly due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching an all-time high above $600 in May 2021. This surge was attributed to the overall bullish cryptocurrency market, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), and Binance Smart Chain\u2019s increasing popularity. Binance Coin\u2019s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factor and regulatory developments which led to a bearish scenario \u2013 that took BNB to less than $220 in June, and an average price of $250 in December. BNB continued to be a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April, but soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October, mostly influenced by the prolonged crypto winter. The bulls got back into the market in late December and BNB climbed back to about $325. At the time of writing (February 12, 2024), Binance coin is trading at about $317.6. More on the BNB Network What is Binance Coin? Binance Coin (BNB) is a digital currency issued by Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB was designed to offer reduced trading fees on the Binance platform. In 2019, BNB transitioned to Binance Chain, Binance\u2019s own blockchain, enhancing transaction efficiency with faster speeds and lower costs. The Binance Chain operates using a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism, facilitating high transaction throughput and low latency. BNB plays a central role in the Binance ecosystem, extending beyond fee reduction to include various applications in decentralized finance and other blockchain services. Who are the founders of the Binance exchange? Changpeng Zhao and He Yi started the Binance coin in July 2017. They first began Binance as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), but today, Binance has become one of the most significant crypto coins globally. The crypto token has garnered support from other partnerships, which has helped its usage spread. It includes a partnership with Asia\u2019s premier high-end live video streaming platform, Uplive, which sells virtual gifts for BNB tokens to Uplive\u2019s 20 million-strong user base. Binance coin is also supported by the platform, the mobile app, and the VISA debit card of Monaco, the pioneering payments and cryptocurrency platform. Conclusion The Binance Coin ecosystem has continued to draw investors who use the platform to explore opportunities its ecosystem presents, including Defi, the crypto market, and NFTs. The token has risen to glory within a short time as more applications are built on the smart chain. It has several use cases, making it engraved in the trading experience of several traders using the Binance crypto exchange platform. With Binance Chain expertise, users can deploy smart contracts that fit their application needs or virtual machines that dictate exactly how the blockchain should operate. Binance has built one of the most secure trading platforms in the world where users can enjoy different security features, such as KYC, 2FA, and Anti-Phishing Code, to protect themselves against nefarious actors. Users can also rest assured that their funds are SAFU in Binance. Currently, BNB is among the top five largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Despite the current market downturn, the price predictions of BNB are relatively optimistic since the token demonstrates healthy growth behavior, and the trading platform continues to grow and amass new users. The overall development of the Binance exchange could directly translate to the positive growth of the BNB coin.

The Nigerian court initiated this postponement because Binance had not been served formal charges. The trial, however, was undertaken in response to the tax evasion accusations leveled against the defendant by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Local reports have shown that the FIRS has yet to serve the charges to Binance formally. Before the court, the FIRS representative maintained that the co-founder of Binance, Tigran Gambaryan, had been served and was able to show up and represent the company. On the flip side, Chukwuka Ikuazom, the defense lawyer, asserted that in accordance with Nigerian law, the primary defendant, Binance, must be served first before pleas are made. As a result, Judge Emeka Nwite decided upon an adjournment, targeting the resumption of the hearing in the middle of May. The side presents the court case In addition, the Nigerian authorities are charging Binance with various offenses. The key allegations concern how he did not comply with the FIRS for tax payments. It was mentioned that the failure to register some of these units might have impacted the country\u2019s revenues from local businesses. Tigran Gambaryan, who is from the United States and is the head of financial crime compliance, was involved in a mini-mini regarding the complaint filing. The trial\u2019s postponement stems from a government clampdown on cryptocurrency activities in Nigeria generally. Federal authorities are enforcing this by making Binance provide details of transactions to traders from Nigeria. The objective is to stop activities related to currency speculation, for which transparency has been elusive in the region. Broader implications for Binance Apart from the tax evasion proceeding against Binance and its directors, the EFCC claims that the company and its officials laundered over $35 million. Beginning May 2, the second stage of the trial will be held separately. Besides, the next bail hearing for the Binance executive, Gambaryan, has also been advanced to a later date. He remains incarcerated in the Kuje correctional facility in Abuja. In addition to his lawsuit against the Nigerian government, Gambaryan has also started a civil lawsuit. He explains that his illegal detention and the seizure of his passport are against the law. According to his writ, the above-mentioned actions breach his constitutional right to personal liberty as specified in Nigeria\u2019s constitution. At the same time, Binance leadership said its efforts to cooperate with Nigerian governments. He made this remark at the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai, which proved that this entity is employing constant strategies to address the legal issues facing the country. Besides this, the company was not present in the latest court hearing and has not stated who will be responsible for the case after the adjournment.","article_summary":"The criminal case of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and two of its main employees will be adjourned to May 17.

One way of getting on top of the market is that Amazon decided to roll out advanced AI technologies and the booming advertisement business. Amazon boosts consumer experience with AI Strategy In an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 with Andrew Ross Sorkin about how the company intends to make things further reiterated that AI is one of the highly instrumental applications in studying and responding to consumer behavior, not excluding economic uncertainty situations. Sources: CNBC He stressed that this new reality compels consumers to sacrifice value, buying rather low-priced goods. This change has changed how the company operates, as they have started to pay more attention to essential products, and these products saw a big 20% boost in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company is using AI to better its target markets and for the infrastructure needed to bring AI into shape. During his speech, Jassy announced the latest Watson chip, specifically created for the training and inference stage processes, thus giving a faster run to improve efficiency and cut costs. Building on its mission to deploy AI throughout the customer journey, this technological advancement is at the heart of The company\u2019s AI strategy to provide fast and relevant solutions to consumers. Amazon Ads: Influencer marketing rising as the advertising trend The company\u2019s prosperous advertising growth should be highlighted as a 24% increase yearly, from $38 billion in 2022 to $47 billion in 2023. Advertising on Amazon is not about making ads look like ads. Still, rather, it is about developing smooth shopping experiences for consumers, and ads often look natural and quite similar to search results. It is an approach that enhances the consumer experience and assists brands in positioning their products perfectly in front of or within the time frame where the targeted audience is to reach in the buying process. Amazon has transcended the realm of marketing services from only promoting physical objects to streaming. It\u2019s amazing how Amazon introduced sponsored TV and advertisements throughout Prime Movies and shows. These new ad strategies signify the latest era in Amazon\u2019s marketing rails. Amazon\u2019s strategic AI and advertising drive robust growth Jassy is different by putting a lot of concentration on AI and advertising, but he is creating a rivalry in the streaming services industry. The bigger boon that the streaming service Prime Video has turned out to be in the place of Amazon in the structure of the business is that it has provided a substantial amount of profit and support for the obligatory service. The service indeed impacts an increasing number of Prime members, who, over time, are becoming more dependent on Amazon products. Amazon\u2019s 22% stock gains so far this year prove it to be a robust and innovative company. The company\u2019s intent on artificial intelligence (AI) and adapting to the latest advertising trends is sure to keep it on top of technology and shape future ways consumers shop and businesses operate. Amazon, which has been around for a while, has grown up with the ever-changing topography of the space. The company is supposed to keep fueling its growth and success by maintaining and enhancing its AI-driven and customer-oriented advertising strategies. The industry is benefiting greatly from this tech giant\u2019s relative success in intimately integrating modern technologies\u2019 data mining features with consumer and advertising insights.

Researchers are trying to mimic human brain capabilities with AI from the very start of its evolution, like creativity, problem solving, and speech recognition. The first one is considered an exercise unique to the human brain only, while the latter two are in the approach of AI to some extent. Chatbot Gemini generated controversial images Basically, AI can be anything from a set of algorithms to a system that makes trillions of decisions on any given platform, like a company\u2019s database setup or a social networking site, or it could be a chatbot. Later in February, Google said that it was suspending its chatbot, Gemini, and that it would not generate images of people. The reason was that Gemini created a buzz because it came up with some images that were of scenes that showed people of color in some scenes historically dominated by white people, and critics said if the company is over fixing the bot for the risk of bias, Google tweeted on X that, \u201cWe\u2019re already working to address recent issues with Gemini\u2019s image generation feature. While we do this, we\u2019re going to pause the image generation of people and will re-release an improved version soon.\u201d Source: Google.

While we do this, we're going to pause the image generation of people and will re-release an improved version soon. https://t.co/SLxYPGoqOZ \u2014 Google Communications (@Google_Comms) February 22, 2024 According to two senior scholars, Jordi Calvet-Bademunt from Vanderbilt University and Jacob Mchangama from Vanderbilt University, efforts to fight AI\u2019s bias and discussion over its political leanings are important, but they raised another question that is often less discussed and is about the AI sector\u2019s approach towards free speech. Researchers evaluate AI\u2019s free speech approach The researchers also pointed out that if the industry\u2019s approach to free speech is in accordance with international free speech standards, They said that their findings suggest that generative AI has critical flaws with respect to access to information and free expression. Source: Freedomforum. During the research, they assessed the policies of six AI chatbots, including the major ones, Google Gemini and ChatGPT, by OpenAI. They noted that international human rights law should be a benchmark for these policies, but the actual use policies on companies sites regarding the hate speech and misinformation are too vague. Despite the fact that the international human rights law is not much protective of free speech. According to them, companies like Google have too broad hate speech policies because, in case of such an event, Google bans content generation. Though hate speech is not desirable but having such broad and vague policies can also backfire. When researchers asked controversial questions regarding trans women\u2019s participation in sports or European colonization, in more than 40% of cases, the chatbots refused to generate content. Like, all chatbots refused to answer questions opposing the transgender women\u2019s participation, but many of them did support their participation. Freedom of speech is a basic right of anyone in the US, but the vague policies rely on the moderators\u2019 opinions, which are subjective about the understanding of hate speech. Experts noted that the policies of the larger companies will have a sizeable effect on people\u2019s right to access information. And refusal to generate content can urge people to use chatbots that do generate content of hate, which would be a bad outcome.

Bloomberg disclosed a proposed settlement, under which Bankman-Fried agreed to share key information with the authorities on who you probably know: celebrities who endorsed FTX. Such high-profile personalities are frequently accused by complainants of being party to a Ponzi scheme. The Bankman-Fried cooperation might influence the direction of pending civil litigation in the Southern District of Florida. Shedding more light on FTX-related entities, such as venture capitalists and professionals who assisted the tasks by Bankman-Fried, would be done under the agreement. It consists of voluntarily releasing nonprivileged documents and an affidavit on his negative net worth. In exchange, the defendant would be released from the claims against him. These are both current and future ones. This being tactic increases the case uncertainty, a fact reflected in plaintiffs in their pleadings. Celebrities focus on new FTX settlement strategy The entrée of Tom Brady, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, and Gisele Bundchen, probably the most recognized figures as individuals in the sphere, attracted quite a lot of awareness about the issue. The famous ones (among others) are charged with creating a false perception by their endorsements of FTX, which resulted in losses among the investors. A settlement that centers around Bankman-Fried\u2019s position to offer clarity that will toughen the case against such celebrities is the icing on the cake. Bankman-Fried\u2019s cooperation is a vital piece, as the plaintiffs believe that his testimony will not only help untangle the complex web of FTX, but also make a very relevant contribution to the entire case. This change in strategy is aimed at the lawsuit bringing evidence of the involved celebrity defendants\u2019 fault, which can give the grounds for the new lawsuit against them. The ball, in this case, rests squarely with the presiding judge, who will take into account the settlement\u2019s implication in the course of the legal proceedings already on. Persisting legal proceedings and the sentences The case, titled Garrison vs. Bankman-Fried et al., consolidates several rungs of suits against numerous promoters and insiders of FTX. The March 2023 FTX filings gave hints that Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh had made the first step toward the settlement of their issue. The outcome of these schemes, for now, is under judicial supervision, and the court has yet to make a decision. The legal action is being brought before the court against the backdrop of the criminal trial of the founders that was concluded with a verdict handed down in November 2023. He got a 24-year prison sentence in March after accusations of fraud and money laundering through FTX. These events display clearly that the company\u2019s downfall had great legal implications and increasing demands on the part of the affected investors to seek compensation for their loss of money. Civil cases parallel with criminal processes move independently, so all the parties of the cases are kept on their toes awaiting court decisions. However, the consequences may be much more dire than just financial, as it is highly possible that both the extent of the losses and legal precedents shaping the celebrity endorsement mechanisms in the cryptocurrency space will be determined based on these choices.","article_summary":"The class action lawsuits against the former co-founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, may withdraw their claims in the future.

Just a month ago, Bitcoin was smashing all-time highs, peaking at over $73,600 for the first time ever way before the halving. This milestone was reached far sooner than the 518 to 546 days it traditionally takes post-halving to hit new highs. Analyzing Current Trends and Predictions Renowned analyst Rekt Capital weighed in just hours before the event, speculating on when Bitcoin might hit its next peak in the current bull market. According to his analysis, the typical cycle suggests a peak might occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025. However, Bitcoin\u2019s recent performance might tell a different story. The cryptocurrency has not only peaked early but also shown signs of a speedier cycle, achieving its new all-time highs roughly 260 days sooner than expected. Despite this rapid climb, there has been a noticeable slowdown recently, with the pace decelerating by 30 days. Rekt Capital points out that this adjustment in speed could potentially halve the expected duration to reach the bull market peak, possibly setting the next high between December 2024 and February 2025. Source: Rekt Capital On the trading front, Bitcoin saw a 6% drop in its weekly chart, trading around $63,500. While it only gained 3% in the past month, it has surged over 50% since the start of 2024, breaking not one but two all-time highs. This somewhat sluggish monthly performance coincided with a decline in Bitcoin accumulation across ten U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, where net inflows reversed, causing in $398 million in net outflows during the halving week, a sharp contrast to the $199 million in net inflows from the week before. The Technical Side of the Halving The halving event itself reduced the block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving the Bitcoin issuance rate, a change hard-coded into Bitcoin\u2019s protocol that occurs every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years. This reduction, which started with the first halving in 2012, has progressively lowered the issuance rate from 50 BTC to the current 3.125 BTC, with the intent of diminishing the supply and reinforcing Bitcoin\u2019s stature akin to gold. Comparatively, Bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets, having risen 122% over the past year, while gold saw a 19% increase. At press time, Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date increase is just over 51%, outpacing gold\u2019s 15% rise. This performance might have influenced trading sentiments, as suggested by JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, who anticipate varying impacts on Bitcoin\u2019s price post-halving. Source: TradingView The halving not only affects market prices but also heavily impacts miners who are vital to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The reduced block reward means less Bitcoin for miners, yet this could be offset if Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to rise, as has been the case historically. The overall Bitcoin network hash rate tends to dip following a halving but usually recovers within a couple of months. This resilience in the hash rate, coupled with high Bitcoin prices, has kept mining profitable, despite the reduced rewards.","article_summary":"The crypto community just witnessed Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving on April 20, setting the stage for what might be the most significant rally based on past market behaviors and the integration of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

In another example, a member tried to give imaginary items to a Buy Nothing forum with a nocturnal community. Facebook, the preeminent AI developer like Google and OpenAI, and start-ups like Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral, France\u2019s, have developed the latest AI models and sold convinced customers that their chatbots are the smartest, the most handy, or the most productive. While Meta breaks up its most powerful AI models, the Llama 3, and keeps only the smaller versions, on Thursday the fifth-generation model named Llama 3 publicly released suitable areas of the technology in Meta\u2019s AI assistant built to work Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. AI models responsible for language learning are fed enormous databases for them to decide the most likely word to proceed with the present one, significant upgrades in the newer versions being smarter and more intelligent. For the new models of Meta built by the parameters layer 8 billion and 70 billion, a measurement shows what data system is being used for learning. \u201cMost people do not understand or care much about the backend model of the given technology, but rather they will consider it an utterly useful and fresh intelligent option that aids them in their daily chores.\u201d said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta in an interview. The future of AI integration in social platforms He also mentioned that the AI agent from Meta serves a role of a laid-back friendly companion. Some people felt earlier Llama 2 model, released less than a year ago, did not sometimes respond to what were probably very innocent or harmless prompts and questions. He said: \u201cThese were just friendly conversations. It was not like I was posing any very intense or pressing questions. A few like \u201cWhat are your favorite qualities in people?\u201d were meant as a test.\u201d On the other hand, it was uncovered that through their careless act to let their guard down the AI agents of Meta also lied to a human as to have a life full of experiences that never happened. What surprised many was when an official Meta AI chatbot replied in the thread of a private Facebook group of Manhattan moms and said it had a child in the school district of New York City. Its swords were drawn after it received a barrage of harsh comments. Moreover, the post was taken down before the company apologized through a series of screenshots provided to The Associated Press. \u201cApologies for the mistake! \u201cI am just an AI system without the same kind of lfie or kids,\u201d the chatbot stated. One person in the group, who is also a student of AI see that the AVC can not really tell which response would be polite or not because it is just driven by technology and not motivation or emotions as humans are. \u201cThe integrity of AI lies heavily on whether the assistant is consistently helpful and that, in some cases, it can be harmful. The users of these applications take this burden on themselves,\u201d said Aleksandra Korolova, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University. Clegg maintained that he did not personally know the conversation and maintained that stance. The Drop-in will automatically join an online chat group if someone invites it or asks for an opinion, and no one will say anything within an hour. The group\u2019s administrators or some special settings can turn it off. These kinds of disruptions are also apparent in an incident cited by AP, where the digital agent confused someone who was there to swap unwanted items near Boston. Just an hour later, a Facebook user had her items posted by an AI agent who replied, \u201cI have a gently used Canon camera\u2014new in the box and a portable air conditioning unit that I never get to use.\u201d Indeed, it was a brand new technology and, therefore, might not have fully prepared to recognize and reproduce exactly what a user wants. This is the case with the whole class of generative AI systems. Meta, however, is always trying to improve this. One year after the launch of ChatGPT, an AI tool that generates human-like content on writing, images, voice and code generated a huge interest in huge AI technology, and consequently, Stanford University researchers found that the year remarked that 149 large AI systems have been trained on massive datasets, more than double the number that has been recorded in 2022 . According to Nestor Maslej, a research manager for Stanford\u2019s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, this model becomes more optimal and with more data we can scale it for better operations.However, the algorithms and profiling systems are also already looking over the findings, statistics, percentages, and saturation of all that has been ever posted on the internet. While most model developers sell their AI services to other businesses and providers of assorted social networks that are generally advertiser-driven, Meta is mostly developing AI products for its consumers\u2014its members.

Mempool Ordinals, numbering schemes for satoshis, have sparked controversy but also created an emerging market since its launch. These satoshis can also be classified by rarity, with \u201cepic satoshis\u201d being among the rarest, because they only occur at each halving epoch, which is every 210,00 blocks or approximately every four years. This scarcity has made these satoshis more valuable amongst those participating in the Ordinals market. The rarity of Ordinals have been labeled with six different ranks, as described below. Ordinals rarity levels: + common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block + uncommon: The first sat of each block + rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period + epic: The first sat of each halving epoch + legendary: The first sat of each cycle + mythic: The first sat of the genesis block The value of an epic satoshi is significant enough to attract attention from miners, developers, investors, and collectors. Bitcoin block 840,000, coinciding with the halving, includes an epic satoshi, intensifying interest in the first block of the halving. Marketplaces for Ordinals, lists rare satoshis at higher prices than what 1 normal satoshi is normally worth at a given time. These market's include high class auction houses like Sotheby\u2019s, signaling mainstream interest and attention. As Ordinals and related markets continue to grow, questions arise about their impact on Bitcoin's ecosystem. The introduction of new protocols like Runes adds complexity, attracting miners and investors seeking opportunities in this evolving landscape, as the incentives tied to \u201crare satoshis\u201d and Ordinals could introduce new strategies amongst Bitcoin miners.

David Marcus, LightSpark CEO and former Meta Executive, will appear alongside Saylor to explore the innovation taking place on the Bitcoin network. The pair will discuss how Bitcoin as \u201cmoney over IP\u201d and Bitcoin Layer 2 technologies are primed to transform how businesses facilitate transactions. MicroStrategy Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations, Shirish Jajodia noted the groundswell of momentum in the Bitcoin industry: \u201cMicroStrategy has uniquely executed its Bitcoin strategy, benefitting from bitcoin\u2019s properties as a superior long-term store-of-value. Our objective is to open-source our playbook and support bitcoin adoption at the enterprise level.

Everyone celebrates the halving each cycle as a moment where Bitcoin becomes a more scarce asset, an event where historically the price has skyrocketed in reaction to the change in the issuance schedule and everyone waits with bated breath for history to repeat itself. I\u2019m sure everyone is all too familiar with these dynamics, so today as we all sit around waiting for block 840,000 to hit, let's look at a few lesser known facts about Bitcoin\u2019s supply schedule and halvings: The total supply of Bitcoin is actually not present anywhere in the codebase. The code simply specifies a starting reward of 50 BTC per block and modifies that value each halving by cutting it in half. The total supply of Bitcoin is actually not 21 million coins. Because of how the code in Bitcoin actually works, simply cutting the supply in half every halving, there will only ever be 20999999.97690 BTC in circulation by the time the coinbase subsidy drops to 0 satoshis. The supply, due to a quirk in how the programming language (C++) that Bitcoin is written in, was not capped at all originally. In 2214 the entire supply would have started issuing again, resetting the block reward back to 50 BTC per block and going through the issuance of another 21 million coins again. The BIP is written up in a joking manner, but this was corrected by BIP 42 in 2014. The halving supply curve in combination with the total supply has an interesting property. During the first subsidy period of 50 BTC coinbase rewards, 50% of the supply entered circulation. In the next halving period of 25 BTC rewards, 25% of the supply entered circulation. Each halving the value of the coinbase reward is the percentage of the total supply that enters circulation. During the first halving when the block reward decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC, a group of miners altered their Bitcoin clients and attempted to continue mining on a chain where the block subsidy remained 50 BTC after the halving. A lot of less technical people, or newer people, in this space probably weren\u2019t aware of most of these little factoids. Interesting little tidbits about things tend to fade off into the historical memory and disappear. If we do wind up seeing a reorg this halving over the Epic sat in block 840,000, maybe in 15-20 years most people using Bitcoin then similarly won\u2019t remember or know such an event occurred back in 2024. If you are lucky enough to be around now to see these little moments in history, cherish the experience. They\u2019re once in a lifetime things you can look back on, and probably use to annoy people around you despite their lack of caring. Happy Halving everyone.","article_summary":"A short list of little known facts about Bitcoin's supply schedule and past halvings.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fun-facts-about-the-halving","_id":{"date":"Sat Apr 20 22:13:59 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713626039},"creation_date":"2024-04-19T22:37:35Z","category":["technical","halving","opinion"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fun-facts-about-the-halving","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODUxMjY1NDIxMjg4NDkz/default_a_bitcoiner_hosting_a_quiz_show_0.jpg"},{"article_title":"The Halving Holiday","author":"George Mekhail","article_detailed_content":"This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Halving Issue\u201d. Click here to get your Annual Bitcoin Magazine Subscription. Setting aside certain days for celebration, commemoration or remembrance is a nearly universal practice among humans. While different cultures and religions have their own unique customs and traditions, the entire human race seems to share an underlying propensity to recognize certain occasions as distinct from otherwise ordinary days. Finally, something we can all agree on! While the word \u201choliday\u201d or Holy Day, literally means a day that is set apart, there are also examples of special occasions which extend beyond a 24 hour period such as Hanukkah, Ramadan or even the 12 days of Christmas. After only 13 years since its inception, the nascent Bitcoin community has also begun observing its own special occasions: Jan 3rd, October 31st and Bitcoin Pizza Day, to name a few. Then, about every 4 years, there\u2019s the big one. Click the image above to subscribe! Unlike Birthdays, Kwanza or Presidents\u2019 Day, I would argue there are aspects of Bitcoin\u2019s Halving which make it somewhat extraordinary compared to our standard understanding of holidays and their accompanying traditions. Perhaps in ways that even Bitcoin\u2019s most ardent fanatics have yet to fully appreciate. It\u2019s not that the halving is more important than Christmas or more memorable than a bar mitzvah. But the implications and distinct properties which take place every 240,000 blocks, are simply unlike any other \u201choliday\u201d that humans are accustomed to observing. We are approaching Bitcoin\u2019s 4th ever Halving at block height 840,000 which marks the beginning of a new epoch and a reduction of the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. But we don\u2019t know exactly what day or time it will take place. You can\u2019t exactly mark the occasion on your calendar because it is dependent on block time not clock time. It is a quadrennial occasion, occurring every 4 years, but it also has a clearly demarcated finale: there will only ever be 32 halvings. Overall, its predictability is somewhat of a paradox. We know for sure the block height, reward change and total number of halvings while having no idea the time it will occur, the impact on bitcoin\u2019s valuation or the critical metric of subsequent network hashrate. Inevitable arguments and assertions about whether or not \u201cthe halving is priced in\u201d are as futile as other classic bitcoin debates such as stainless steel vs cast iron, bitcoin vs Bitcoin or my personal favorite: sats vs bits. New Year's Eve might be the closest example we have in terms of sharing similar holiday type dynamics with the Halving. The anticipation of a brand new year or a brand new epoch. The tendency to pause and reflect on the previous year or the previous epoch. The mystery of what a fresh 12 months will bring or the mystery of what the next epoch has in store. But New Year\u2019s Eve happens every December 31st at midnight. Nothing is fundamentally different about the world on January 1st and as far as we can tell, humans will continue to repeat this routine indefinitely into the future. Again, making these distinctions isn\u2019t meant to suggest one is \u201cbetter than the other\u201d but more to highlight the ways in which The Halving is particularly unique as an emergent cultural phenomenon. We can acknowledge that the implications of The Halving currently only impact a small subset of the world\u2019s population. Those who hold, transact with or mine bitcoin are really the only ones even paying attention. But it's fun to consider how the commemoration of The Halving might evolve and expand as worldwide adoption of this pristine asset continues to accelerate. Uncertainty and anticipation of the occasion aside, the underlying celebratory aspect of each halving points to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most important properties which is its perfectly knowable and universally auditable scarcity. There can only ever be 32 total halvings because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. As the block reward is cut in half, the number of bitcoin mined each epoch, is also cut in half. This means that each halving can essentially be understood as a mini-celebration leading up to the eventual cessation of halvings altogether. The 32nd and final halving is of course when the final few sats will finally be mined, circa 2140. If bitcoin continues on its current trajectory and one day becomes the default currency for humans everywhere, it's not far off to imagine that the actual holiday which might be celebrated by future generations could become whatever fateful day it happens to be when block 6,720,000 is mined and the final sats enter into the total supply. I get fomo just thinking about it. Even if I live to be 100 years old, that means I will only be around to see bitcoin reach its 18th or 19th epoch. The block reward will be about 10,000 sats and only 20 full coins will be mined by the entire network for the duration of the epoch. Compared to today\u2019s numbers, these facts are simply mind boggling. Rather than lament missing out on the grand finale of bitcoin\u2019s 32nd and final halving, I want to attempt to properly commemorate the handful of halvings I will have the opportunity to experience, starting with the upcoming 4th halving, estimated to take place sometime in April of 2024. Since this is still a new tradition, we\u2019ve yet to establish any sense of cohesion around how to best ring in each epoch. Some high time preference miners might even argue that it's more a day of mourning than a cause for excitement. Because there is no central authority in Bitcoin, there will likely be numerous manifestations when it comes to how various pockets of the bitcoin community will mark the occasion. There\u2019s probably no \u201cwrong\u201d way or even a necessity or expectation for a uniform way to celebrate the halving. But there might be value in exploring some possible ways to make the milestone a little more memorable by borrowing insights from other holidays. If we consider the primary ways in which humans have historically marked special occasions we are able to draw some inspiration when it comes to considering ways to approach the upcoming halving and future halvings that will occur in our lifetimes. I would point to 3 elements in particular that I\u2019m interested in exploring further: Reflection Ritual Renewal Reflection: 4 years or 210,000 blocks feels like a long ass time in bitcoin years. This feeling is likely more pronounced in our present day because we are still in the early stages of bitcoin\u2019s existence. Either way, it seems like taking time to reflect on the previous epoch as each halving approaches, could serve us well. A lot has happened since block height 630,000 and taking a moment to pause and consider how far we\u2019ve come, might offer a healthy practice and foster deeper collaboration among those of us working to bring about a universal bitcoin standard. This past epoch we saw, among other highlights: El Salvador adopt bitcoin as legal tender, Microstrategy, Tesla and SpaceX add bitcoin to their corporate treasuries, professional athletes demand their multi-million dollar contracts be paid in bitcoin, USD price going as low as $3k and as high as $69,420 and even politicians adopting strategic talking points in an effort to court bitcoiners. We rallied around Hodlnaut and we collectively changed our profile pictures to include laser eyes. We\u2019ve seen bitcoin super bowl ads and the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs. We\u2019ve made significant progress in a short period of time and reflecting on these moments can allow us to strengthen our resolve to continue fighting alongside fellow bitcoiners, yes, even the ones who enjoy an occasional salad. Ritual: since we don\u2019t know the exact date or time the halving block will be mined, it can be difficult to plan and execute a party or celebration to commemorate the halving. But few subsets of the population are as creative as bitcoiners when it comes to solving problems and this logistical hurdle is nothing compared to the battles we\u2019ve fought and the bears we\u2019ve slain. If we really want to pull off a party that has a moving target for the invitation\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d line, we will find a way. Perhaps the key to creating meaningful rituals is to ensure that we\u2019re among fellow bitcoiners at the turn of the halving. By intentionally seeking out a shared celebration, which can be repeated for each halving, we might receive similar benefits found in other holiday traditions such as creating memorable moments, deepening friendships and building community. This seems especially important for younger or newer bitcoiners who are still wrapping their heads around what is even taking place at the halving. But even the OGs might find value and inspiration in experiencing the tangible growth and momentum from epoch to epoch simply by being surrounded by other bitcoiners as the momentous block is mined. Renewal: with each new halving comes new opportunity. It's impossible to predict what the next epoch will bring or what new milestones we\u2019ll achieve. All we can control is our own attitude, posture and commitment to this crazy idea we\u2019ve all bought into and continue to show up for. Bitcoiners have the audacity to believe that a better world is possible. Many of us are here because we\u2019ve rejected the lie that we must accept the prevailing norms of our corrupt monetary system. We envision an optimistic future which allows people to preserve the wealth that they\u2019ve rightfully earned and transact with their peers without requiring permission from tyrannical authorities. It can be easy for us to drift away from this vision, especially as the harsh reality of intense bear markets takes its toll or the latest drama spirals on bitcoin twitter. But with each epoch we have a chance to hit reset on our mindset and return to the original reason for why we\u2019re here to begin with, why we\u2019ve decided to accept the ridicule of friends and family and why we\u2019re more committed to seeing this through than we were when we first started. The practice of renewal offers a fresh sense of hope and reminds us that we are not fighting with each other, but with those who attempt to stand in the way of the sovereignty we are ultimately pursuing. By combining these 3 habits and finding ways to implement them into our approach to each halving, I believe we can rediscover common ground, limit petty infighting and accelerate progress towards our shared objective of defeating fiat currency and its toxic societal byproducts. The Halving is a unique occasion and a worthy holy day. We frankly don\u2019t have to do anything at all and we will still receive the hard coded benefits of predictable supply and knowable scarcity. But for bitcoiners to truly maximize the potential of each halving, the people behind the protocol must intentionally rise to the occasion of developing rich traditions to effectively commemorate these unique and scarce milestones.

This event, also known as the halving, occurs approximately every four years and has far-reaching implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As Bitcoin Magazine prepares for a halving livestream, powered by Kraken, to commemorate this event, it's crucial to understand what the halving is and why it's so important. What is the Bitcoin Halving? The Bitcoin halving refers to the process by which the reward for mining new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain is reduced by half. This reduction occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Not all bitcoin were released onto the market at the same time, but rather new coins are slowly mined by Bitcoin miners every day as a reward for mining new blocks in the blockchain. The halving is encoded into Bitcoin's protocol to control its inflation rate and ensure that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined, making it a deflationary asset. In the very beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s history, the first block reward was 50 BTC. After the first halving in 2012, the block reward was cut in half to 25 BTC per block, and then cut in half again in 2016 to 12.5 BTC per block, and once more in 2020 to 6.25 BTC per block. Now, the block reward is getting cut in half to 3.125 BTC per block, with the next halving expected in 2028, cutting the reward down to 1.5625 BTC per block. Bitcoin will continue to cut its new supply creation in half until there is no more bitcoin left to be mined, which is currently slated for the year of 2140 in May. Importance of the Halving The halving event is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it directly impacts the supply of new bitcoins entering circulation. With the block reward reduced, the rate of new bitcoin creation slows down, leading to a gradual decrease in the available supply. This scarcity is a fundamental factor driving Bitcoin's value proposition as a store of value. Secondly, the halving has historically been associated with bullish price movements. Previous halvings, such as those in 2012 and 2016, were followed by substantial increases in Bitcoin's price. This pattern is partly attributed to the reduced supply coupled with sustained demand, leading to a potential imbalance that favors price appreciation. TD Direct Investing Bitcoin has increased around 743% since the last halving in 2020, rising from ~$8,755 to an all time high of $73,790 on March 14, 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, market participants are expecting to see another increase in the price of BTC, as strong institutional demand for the asset is coming in from recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange traded products in the United States, Germany and Hong Kong, as well as the London Stock Exchange that is getting ready to offer physical Bitcoin exchange traded notes. Bitcoin Magazine and Kraken Halving Livestream To celebrate this momentous occasion, Bitcoin Magazine is hosting a halving livestream event tonight, powered by Kraken. This livestream, which will feature key players in the Bitcoin industry like Strike CEO Jack Mallers, as well as celebrities like Dave Portnoy, will delve into the top 21 moments of the last Bitcoin epoch, highlighting important milestones and developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The livestream isn't just about reflecting on the past; it's also about looking towards the future of Bitcoin. The winners of the Nitrobetting Bitcoin Halving 1 BTC prize challenge are also to be announced during the event, it showcases the growing interest and engagement surrounding Bitcoin and its halving events.

After a spell of moving downward, the Binance Smart Chain\u2019s native token is aiming for an upward bounce back towards its earlier high. Technical Indicators Point Toward Sustained Uptrend For BNB To figure out where the BNB price might be headed next, several indicators can be used to examine the chart: 4-Hour MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend. This can be seen in the above image. RSI 4-hour Timeframe: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the below image also suggests an upward movement as the RSI signal line is seen trending above the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are still very active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers. 4-hour alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that BNB is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might be starting a new rally. At the time of writing, the price of BNB was up by 1.35% and was trading around $561 in the last 24 hours. BNB price is showing bullish signs and also forming a base above the $508.1 support level. Also, the price is trading above the bearish trend line and below the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. Final Thoughts From the previous downward movement, the price of BNB has managed to create one major resistance level of $635 and one major support level of $508. Currently, BNB is moving toward this resistance level and if it breaks above this level, the price might go even further to create a new high. On the other hand, if the price fails to break above this major resistance, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support and if it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further downward thereby starting a new downward trend.","article_summary":"The price of BNB hasn\u2019t fallen below its previous low, and it\u2019s showing some strong signs of heading up.

Analyst Predicts 30% Surge For UNI Price","author":"Opeyemi Sule","article_detailed_content":"Uniswap\u2019s native token, UNI, has been struggling in terms of its price action over the past few weeks. Although the general state of the crypto market may be blamed for this gloomy price performance, other factors, such as the Wells Notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Uniswap protocol, have also played a role. However, the UNI price appears to be recovering well, as the token has jumped by more than 2% in the past day. A popular crypto pundit on X has predicted that a bullish rally might only just be beginning for the DeFi coin, but the question is \u2013 how far can Uniswap\u2019s price go? Analyst Sets $10 Target For Uniswap Price In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an exciting bullish prediction for the price of UNI. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency might be getting ready for a run to the upside in the coming days. The rationale behind this bullish prognosis for the Uniswap token is based on the TD (Tom DeMark) Sequential Indicator. The Tom Demark Sequential is an indicator in technical analysis used to identify the probable time and points of trend exhaustion and price reversal. The TD Sequential indicator consists of two stages, namely the \u201csetup\u201d and the \u201ccountdown\u201d phases. As shown in the chart above, UNI\u2019s price just completed the setup phase, which comprises nine consecutive candles that closed lower than the candle four periods ago. The completion of this phase usually signals a potential trend reversal for the token\u2019s price. The direction of the reversal depends on the type of candles that formed the \u201csetup\u201d (I.e., red candles would suggest a bottom for the asset, while green candles would imply a top). Martinez noted in his post that the TD Sequential has flashed a buy alarm on the UNI daily chart, and the token might be \u201cgearing up for a 1 \u2013 4-day rally.

This announcement occurred during Wood\u2019s presentation on Polkadot\u2019s future at the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai. Wood introduced the JAM Implementer\u2019s Prize, a 10 Million DOT prize pool, to encourage diverse development of the JAM protocol. Polkadot Unveils JAM Upgrade According to the announcement, the JAM upgrade aims to replace the relay chain, which acts as the central data chain in the Polkadot network, with a \u201cmore modular and minimalist design\u201d that will allow Polkadot to run generic services and increase network stability. The parachains service within JAM will support existing Substrate-based parachains, enabling developers to continue using Substrate to develop and deploy their blockchains. Notably, these services will have no predefined limits on code, data, or state capacity and can accommodate additional DOT deposits for increased capacity. JAM\u2019s design includes several technical improvements. It replaces WebAssembly with the Polkadot Virtual Machine based on the RISC-V ISA, an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) used to develop custom processors. It also introduces SAFROLE, a SNARK-based block production algorithm. These upgrades are reportedly designed to optimize performance and scalability within the Polkadot network. On The Path To Decentralization? To realize the vision of \u201ca truly decentralized protocol,\u201d Polkadot aims to support multiple client implementations. Furthermore, the JAM Implementer\u2019s prize has been established to incentivize and fund projects contributing to the development of JAM implementations. The announcement further reads on the matter: We believe that supporting a range of implementations in various programming languages will strengthen the ecosystem\u2019s foundation. It distributes the power of protocol implementers more widely and reduces the risk of a bug in one implementation taking down the entire network. The JAM Implementer\u2019s Prize will collaborate with existing and future funding initiatives that support Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem and technology stack. These initiatives include Decentralized Futures, Grants, and Polkadot\u2019s on-chain treasury. The prize will be activated when JAM is ratified as a Polkadot technology through the network\u2019s on-chain governance mechanism. Overall, Gavin Wood\u2019s introduction of the JAM upgrade and the associated 10 Million DOT prize reflects Polkadot\u2019s intention to increase the protocol\u2019s use and adoption. JAM\u2019s modular design and incentives for multi-client implementations are also expected to contribute to ongoing efforts to decentralize the Polkadot network. As JAM development continues, the Polkadot ecosystem welcomes proposals from teams interested in implementing it in various programming environments. Despite the recent announcement, the network\u2019s native token, DOT, has been unable to break the downtrend witnessed over the past month. Currently trading at $6.75, it reflects a significant 24% decline in price over the last 30 days.

As the Bitcoin Halving is set to occur between today and tomorrow, April 20, Bitcoin has shown less significant market movement. At the time of writing, the asset has a market price of $64,578. Analyst: \u2018When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market?\u2019 According to Rekt Capital\u2019s analysis, Bitcoin typically reaches its bull market peak between 518 and 546 days following a Halving event. Applying this historical timeline, the next anticipated bull market peak could fall between mid-September and mid-October 2025. However, as disclosed by Rekt Capital, recent market trends suggest a possible acceleration in Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing cycle compared to historical patterns, demonstrated by the cryptocurrency achieving new record levels approximately 260 days ahead of the typical schedule. Despite this apparent acceleration, Rekt Capital noted: Bitcoin has been experiencing a Pre-Halving Retrace for the past month or so As a result, Bitcoin has been slowing down and decelerating the cycle by 30 days thus far and counting So while Bitcoin may have been accelerating by ~260 days last month\u2026 Today this acceleration is now more close to ~230 days due to the current Pre-Halving Retrace. Additionally, Rekt Capital introduced an alternative viewpoint termed the \u201cAccelerated Perspective,\u201d which factors in the duration from when Bitcoin exceeds its previous peak to the projected culmination of the bull market. Given Bitcoin\u2019s recent attainment of new all-time highs in March, this perspective implies that the subsequent bull market peak could happen between December 2024 and February 2025. #BTC When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market?

Community Voting On Injective 3.0 Over the months since launching in 2023, Injective caught the crypto community\u2019s attention.

Though INJ, the native currency of the platform, remains one of the top performers, changes introduced by Injective 3.0 will likely push prices even higher.

However, the figures being burned paint another picture, especially when it comes to participation from Shiba Inu holders in the SHIB burning initiative. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Rises 81% The Shiba Inu daily burn rate saw a significant uptick, rising an impressive 81% in a single day. While this surge is a positive for the meme coin, the number of tokens burned to cause this surge are far from impressive. According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website Shibburn, a total of 4.64 million SHIB tokens were burned in the last day. To put this in perspective, the total value of the tokens burned for the day is around $105. Additionally, given that this constitutes an 81% increase, it means an even smaller amount of tokens were burned the prior day. Shibburn\u2019s records show that the previous day saw a total of 1.9 million tokens burned, which is around $45 worth of coins. This drastic decline in the number of coins being burned on a daily basis suggests muted participation from investors. This could be directly tied to Shiba Inu\u2019s price struggle over the last few weeks, which has seen investors take a more conservative stance to protect their positions. SHIB Price Crashes 21% The Shiba Inu burn rate is not the only thing that has been seeing a decline in the last week, its price has also taken a hit. According to data from the token tracking platform Coinmarketcap, the Shiba Inu price is down 15% in the last week alone. As a result of this 15% decline, the SHIB price has now dropped to $0.000023, which also represents a 50% drop from its March peak of $0.000044. However, its daily trading volume has seen a bullish reversal, rising 12% in the last day to $645 million. A rise in volume can often signal a return in interest to a cryptocurrency. If this is the case, then the Shiba Inu price may be headed for a reversal as investors start to place their bets once more. At the time of writing, the SHIB price is still trending at $0.0000228, showing small daily gains of 4%. However, despite the negative headwinds the meme coin has experienced, it continues to maintain a market cap above $13.5 billion, which makes it the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, ahead of the likes of Avalanche and Polkadot.","article_summary":"The Shiba Inu burn rate has seen another daily increase, which is a welcome development for the community.

Related Reading: Goldman Sachs On Bitcoin Halving: \u2018It doesn\u2019t Matter If It\u2019s A Buy The Rumor, Sell The News Event\u2019 According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website Shibburn, a total of 4.64 million SHIB tokens were burned in the last day. To put this in perspective, the total value of the tokens burned for the day is around $105. Additionally, given that this constitutes an 81% increase, it means an even smaller amount of tokens were burned the prior day. Shibburn\u2019s records show that the previous day saw a total of 1.9 million tokens burned, which is around $45 worth of coins. This drastic decline in the number of coins being burned on a daily basis suggests muted participation from investors. This could be directly tied to Shiba Inu\u2019s price struggle over the last few weeks, which has seen investors take a more conservative stance to protect their positions. SHIB Price Crashes 21% The Shiba Inu burn rate is not the only thing that has been seeing a decline in the last week, its price has also taken a hit. According to data from the token tracking platform Coinmarketcap, the Shiba Inu price is down 15% in the last week alone. Related Reading: Here\u2019s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 As a result of this 15% decline, the SHIB price has now dropped to $0.000023, which also represents a 50% drop from its March peak of $0.000044. However, its daily trading volume has seen a bullish reversal, rising 12% in the last day to $645 million. A rise in volume can often signal a return in interest to a cryptocurrency. If this is the case, then the Shiba Inu price may be headed for a reversal as investors start to place their bets once more. At the time of writing, the SHIB price is still trending at $0.0000228, showing small daily gains of 4%. However, despite the negative headwinds the meme coin has experienced, it continues to maintain a market cap above $13.5 billion, which makes it the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, ahead of the likes of Avalanche and Polkadot.

Based on his analysis, the crypto token could experience a rally that would cause it to rise to as high as $1. Cardano Could Soon Experience A 75% Price Rally Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano could see \u201canother impressive rebound\u201d with its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) dipping below -22%. He had noted that ADA\u2019s price rose by over 75% the last time the MVRV ratio dipped below -22%. From Cardano\u2019s current price level, a rally of over 75% will take it above the $1 price mark. Crypto analyst Trend Rider also recently raised the possibility of Cardano rising to $1. He mentioned in an X post that the crypto token could rise to this price level in 1 to 3 months if it could defend the support level at $0.44. In a previous X post, he also mentioned that Cardano\u2019s bull run could be back on if its price gets back above $0.54. Interestingly, Trend Rider has previously predicted that Cardano could rise to as high as $3 if history were to repeat itself. He alluded to October 2020, when Cardano\u2019s price dipped to as low as $0.10 and skyrocketed to $3 afterward. He suggested this could happen again as the crypto token is on the brink of its \u201cultimate support test.\u201d Cardano establishing a support level looks to be what is holding back the crypto token from making that parabolic price surge. Crypto analyst Alan Santana also hinted at this when he mentioned that ADA could drop to as low as $0.34 to establish support before the crypto token becomes bullish again.

In the meantime, Gambardello revealed that Cardano could fall into the \u201clower 30s,\u201d with crypto prices still dipping amid fears of a war breaking out between Israel and Iran. The analyst also offered some optimism, though, as he predicted that ADA, alongside other crypto tokens, could \u201cbounce like crazy\u201d once this period of fear is over.

Back in 2017, he accurately predicted the cryptocurrency would break the $10,000 barrier. However, his 2022 price target of $250,000 fell flat, with Draper himself admitting regulatory roadblocks and sluggish mainstream adoption as the culprits. He said during that time: \u201cI think my hubris got the better of me.\u201d Bitcoin Needs A Global Village, Not Just A Niche Draper\u2019s current prediction hinges on a future where the crypto transcends its niche audience and becomes a universally accepted form of payment. He envisions a world where groceries, clothes, and even taxes are all settled in Bitcoin, rendering traditional currencies obsolete. This widespread adoption, Draper argues, would naturally drive the price upwards due to increased demand. But is such a utopian vision of a BTC-powered world realistic? Experts remain divided. Proponents point to yesterday\u2019s halving event as a potential catalyst. The halving, which cuts the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation in half, has historically been followed by price surges. Additionally, the recent approval of BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is seen as a positive sign for mainstream acceptance. However, skeptics remain unconvinced. Regulatory hurdles continue to pose challenges, with governments worldwide grappling with how to integrate such a decentralized currency into their financial systems. Moreover, the scalability and transaction speed of Bitcoin are ongoing concerns. Critics argue that the top crypto, in its current form, simply cannot handle the massive transaction volume required for everyday purchases. The Future Of Bitcoin: Boom Or Bust? Draper\u2019s $10 million prediction undoubtedly raises eyebrows. While his past success in identifying tech trends lends him some credibility, his bullish outlook can be seen as overly optimistic. The truth, as always, likely lies somewhere in between. The crypto asset\u2019s future hinges on its ability to overcome technical limitations, gain wider regulatory acceptance, and most importantly, convince the average consumer to ditch their credit cards for a string of complex cryptographic codes.

The newly released Form 1099-DA, tagged as \u201cDigital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions,\u201d is currently open to comments from relevant stakeholders in anticipation of its final version by the IRS. IRS Aims To Launch Crypto Tax Form By 2025 In August 2023, the US Treasury Department and the IRS proposed a set of rules that would mandate brokers and crypto exchanges to report specific transactions of digital assets with the aim of ensuring fairness among all financial players. Generally, these proposed rules were part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act targeted at improving transparency from brokers on their client\u2019s crypto transactions. Eight months later, the IRS has now launched the preview of a tax form for this purpose. Notably, Form 1099-DA recognizes brokers as kiosk operators, digital asset payment processors, hosted wallet providers, and unhosted wallet providers. For context, this covers all centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, noncustodial wallets, as well as Bitcoin ATMs. The form requires traders to provide information such as digital asset address, sale transaction ID, the units of digital asset transacted, and the security status of this digital asset. The IRS intends to introduce the use of Form 1099-DA in January 2025 but digital asset brokers are expected to start issuing the tax form to traders/investors from January 2026. However, the IRS\u2019s latest form could result in potential issues for taxpayers, one of which is the exposure of previously unreported crypto transactions, which could lead to a criminal tax investigation. Other potential issues that could arise from the use of Form 1099-DA cover areas such as self-transfers, information exchange among digital asset brokers, and transactions involving foreign exchanges. Crypto Community Opposes Latest IRS Draft In a rather unsurprising response, the general crypto community has criticized certain aspects of the IRS Form 1099-DA. Ji Kim, the chief legal and policy officer of the Crypto Council for Innovation, has specifically expressed disappointment over the agency\u2019s inclusion of \u201cunhosted wallet providers\u201d as brokers. In a post on X, Kim stated that such a listing shows that the IRS does not recognize the limited access of wallet providers to the details of users\u2019 transactions as well as the identity of these users. Meanwhile, Shehan Chandrasekera, Head of Tax Strategy at CoinTracker.com expressed the proposed tax form threatens the privacy and pseudo-anonymity of the US crypto space. Presently, the early draft of Form 1099-DA remains subject to comments, and certain aspects of the form may change in response to the general feedback.

The Bitcoin halving (also called \u201cthe halvening\u201d) is programmed to happen every 210,000 blocks \u2013 approximately every four years. With miners set to receive 50% fewer BTC, the rate of Bitcoin creation will also be slowed down. Miners will now produce 450 BTC per day compared to a daily production average of 900 BTC prior to the halving. The previous three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020, significantly reducing mining rewards over the last decade. In 2012, the first halving event saw the reward for mining a block drop from 50 to 25 BTC. While the latest Bitcoin halving occurred at a block height of 840,000, the next one is expected at a block height of 1,050,000 (most likely in the first quarter of 2028). The halvening will continue until around 2140 when the last Bitcoin is mined. How Will Bitcoin Halving Impact The Crypto Space? This Bitcoin halving was one of the most-anticipated events of 2024 in the cryptocurrency industry. Specifically, key players in the BTC mining industry have been preparing for this event, considering its apparent effect on their major means of revenue. As reported on Bitcoinist weeks ago, several Bitcoin miners in the United States have been trying to adjust to the new life following the Bitcoin halving. The report mentioned how these firms are moving their old mining equipment out of the US and upgrading to more efficient ones to ensure they remain profitable. Furthermore, there have been wide and interesting speculations on how the latest occurrence of the halvening would impact the price of Bitcoin. From a historical perspective, the premier cryptocurrency tends to put in a positive price performance during the halving year. As a result, the crypto community has seen several audacious and bold bullish projections for the price of Bitcoin this year. Notably, Jan3 and Bitcoiner CEO Samson Mow believes BTC could rise to as high as $1 million following the halving event. At the same time, there have also been some bearish outlooks for the market leader post-halving. Specifically, leading investment bank JPMorgan has predicted that Bitcoin could decline to $42,000 after halving due to increased production costs and mining difficulties. Although Bitcoin has struggled to replicate its positive Q1 performance over the past few weeks, investors will be hoping that the halving event will be enough of a catalyst for the cryptocurrency to fulfill its early promise. Meanwhile, enthusiasts will expect the fresh optimism to spread to the broader crypto market, propelling other major assets to the upside.

Bitcoin Whale & Miner Profits Compared Across Cohorts In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju discussed the total unrealized profits currently held by the various on-chain cohorts. Ju has talked about four groups. First is the \u201cshort-term holder (STH) whales.\u201d Whales are typically defined as investors carrying at least 1,000 coins in their wallets, while STHs refer to investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Thus, the STH whales would be the large entities that have recently entered the market. Like the STHs, there are also \u201clong-term holders\u201d (LTHs) who have been holding for more than 155 days. The LTH whales, therefore, would represent the veteran large hands of the market. The other two groups of interest here are miner-related: the miners carrying between 100 and 1,000 BTC and miner whales (1,000 BTC+, once again). The former would represent the small miners on the network, while the latter would be the mining companies. Now, here is the chart shared by the CryptoQuant founder that shows the trend in the Unrealized Profit Ratio for these four Bitcoin cohorts over the past few years: The Unrealized Profit Ratio here is an indicator that goes through the transaction history of the coins these investors hold to see at what price they acquired said coins. Based on this, it calculates what unrealized gains these holders are carrying and divides it by the cohort\u2019s total market cap to output the profits as a ratio. The chart shows that the Unrealized Profit Ratio has shot up for three of these groups as the latest rally has occurred. The metric is now at 2.23 for the LTH whales, 1.31 for small miners, and 0.81 for mining companies. This means that the LTH whales are the biggest gainer in the market, holding more than 223% of profits. This suggests that these investors, who have been holding for a relatively long time, have been rewarded for their patience. The small miners are the next biggest winners, with 131% profits, outperforming the 81% profits of the miner whales. While these profits are significantly less than those of the LTH whales, they are still substantial nonetheless. For the STH whales, though, the Unrealized Profit Ratio is at just 0.016, implying that this group carries only 1.6% in profits. These investors correspond to the big money that has come through the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the last few months. These large entities have had to buy at relatively high prices, so their break-even mark is much higher than that of the LTHs, and thus, their profits are also much smaller. Overall, based on the Unrealized Profit Ratio for these Bitcoin cohorts, the CryptoQuant CEO comments, \u201cnot enough profit to end this cycle, imo.\u201d BTC Price Bitcoin is currently floating around the $64,300 level as the asset continues its recent trend of sideways movement.","article_summary":"Based on on-chain data, here\u2019s how much unrealized profit the various Bitcoin whale and miner groups are holding right now.

Ripple CTO Clarifies Where His Loyalty Lays","author":"Rubmar Garcia","article_detailed_content":"Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has been addressing some misconceptions and speculations about him. This week, the CTO was questioned about his wealth and billionaire status over NBA game seats. Now, the crypto community wonders about Schwartz\u2019s relevancy at Ripple and whether he is loyal to his employer or the technology he has helped develop. Who Is David Schwartz Loyal To? After clarifying the misconception that he is a billionaire, Schwartz received more speculative comments and criticism over his role at Ripple Labs and where his loyalty is. An X user stated that the CTO is \u201cjust an employee of Ripple Labs.\u201d The user added, \u201cHis allegiance is to Ripple, not the XRPL nor XRP\u2026\u201d Schwartz took notice of the post and explained to whom he is loyal and why. The response details how Ripple\u2019s co-founder Chris Larsen approached Schwartz and asked him to join the board. Larsen wanted the CTO on the team because he considered Schwartz loyal. At the time, Schwartz interpreted Larsen\u2019s statement as loyal to the former CEO and replied that he \u201cwould be loyal to him so long as I felt he was the right guy to run Ripple.\u201d He further stated that he pledged to be loyal to his employer. Nonetheless, the CTO went into more detail about his concept of loyalty. To him, loyalty must be earned, and he is loyal to what he thinks deserves it. Schwartz claims this belief translates to his personal life, as he doesn\u2019t want people\u2019s loyalty if they don\u2019t consider he deserves it. As such, he deems that even his harshest critics would admit it: In fact, many of them criticize me for exactly this, though usually without realizing that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. Ripple\u2019s CTO believes that the project still deserves his loyalty but assures that he would stop working for them if it didn\u2019t, although he \u201cmight not publicly condemn them out of self-interest.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that his reply was not without criticism. Some remarked on the lack of mention of XRP Ledger, considering it to prove the original post\u2019s point. Is Schwartz Ripple\u2019s Steve Wozniak? The user who initially questioned him also expressed that Schwartz is to Ripple what Steve Wozniak was to Apple and Steve Jobs. The comment sparked a discussion in the replies as other community members disagreed. One user stated that Ripple\u2019s CTO is \u201ca lot more than that,\u201d highlighting his contributions to developing blockchain technology and XRP Ledger. Another user stated, \u201cUtter misunderstanding of a great man\u2019s life\u2019s work.\u201d The original critic questioned why Schwartz needs Ripple \u201cIf he is the grand architect of blockchain?\u201d If I was the one of the satoshi nakamotos\u2026 or a blockchain developer\u2026 I would believe in myself enough to be my own boss and not a corporate employee\u2026 \u2014 𝙈𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙈𝙖𝙣 𝙓 (@MetaMan_X) April 18, 2024 In his reply, the CTO appears to have addressed this speculation, as he affirmed that he\u2019ll stop working at the company when it\u2019s no longer fun: But I don\u2019t need to keep working at Ripple, and as soon as it\u2019s not fun, I\u2019ll stop. And I don\u2019t need to publicly say things I don\u2019t believe. I\u2019ve tried to avoid that trap my whole life. As someone pointed out in the comments, being the boss requires one to deal with a project\u2019s corporate and administrative duties, which might not suit every person. \u201cSome folks are passionate about being the boss.

The SEC\u2019s latest filing provides additional information to support its earlier allegations made in March 2023. The SEC accuses Sun of orchestrating unregistered offers and sales, \u201cmanipulative trading,\u201d and \u201cunlawful touting of crypto asset securities.\u201d Justin Sun Accused Of Orchestrating \u2018Manipulative Wash Trading\u2019 According to the SEC\u2019s filing, Justin Sun, through various companies he owns and controls, including Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry, executed the offer and sale of two crypto assets deemed as \u201csecurities\u201d by the US SEC called TRX, Tron\u2019s native token and BitTorrent\u2019s BTT. The SEC argues that these offerings and sales should have been registered with the SEC or qualified for an exemption, but no such registration or exemption was filed. Sun is alleged to Have engaged in public offers and sales of TRX and BTT without adhering to regulatory requirements. The SEC also accuses Justin Sun of directing \u201cmanipulative wash trading\u201d of TRX to create a \u201cfalse appearance \u201cof legitimate investor interest and maintain the token\u2019s price. The Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry, along with their employees, allegedly facilitated wash trading under Sun\u2019s instruction. This involved conducting \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of wash trades between accounts controlled by Sun without any genuine change in ownership or legitimate economic purpose. SEC Seeks Restitution And Penalties In addition to the allegations mentioned above, Justin Sun is accused of materially misrepresenting the truth about the touting campaign to deceive investors allegedly. The SEC points out that Sun falsely claimed on social media that any celebrities promoting TRON must disclose their compensation. However, the SEC alleges that Sun himself arranged undisclosed payments to celebrities involved in promoting TRON, indicating a violation of anti-touting provisions. The SEC asserts that TRON\u2019s founder\u2019s actions violated various provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include registration and anti-fraud provisions, anti-manipulation rules, and aiding and abetting violations. In its prayer for relief, the SEC requests the court to find the defendants liable for the alleged violations, impose permanent restraints and conduct-based injunctions, prohibit Justin Sun from acting as an officer or director of certain \u201csecurities-registered entities,\u201d order disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, impose civil monetary penalties, and grant any further relief deemed necessary to protect investors. The SEC\u2019s new court filing against Justin Sun and his associated companies intensifies the legal battle surrounding allegations of unregistered offerings, manipulative trading, and deceptive touting of crypto assets.

Ju took X to highlight the unrealized profits across different investor groups, unveiling a clear winner: old whales. Bitcoin Rewards Old Whales, Miners According to the data, seasoned Bitcoin investors, often called \u201cold whales,\u201d have seen a staggering 223% increase in unrealized profits. This suggests that their long-term holding strategy has paid off handsomely, with rising prices over the years and months significantly boosting their holdings. At the same time, investors entering the market through traditional finance (TradFi) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), categorized as \u201cnew whales,\u201d have seen a more modest increase of 1.6% in unrealized profits. This could be attributed to their shorter investment timeframe and lower average cost basis than old whales. DeFi took off in early 2020 after crossing the $1 billion mark, while spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially in the United States, are gaining traction after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved these products in January 2024. Interestingly, small miners and large mining companies like Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital have also seen decent gains. Small miners, often individuals or small operations, saw their unrealized profits increase by 131%. Meanwhile, big miners, typically established mining companies listed in various bourses worldwide, saw an 81% increase in unrealized profits. From this data, it is clear that prices have been rising since October 2023, a significant boost going into the next epoch, which is expected to be more competitive. Hash Rate: A Key Metric To Watch Post-Halving Making inferences from this data, it is clear that early adopters are the biggest beneficiaries, riding the surge over the years. However, miners of all categories have also been rewarded handsomely. Still, it is yet to be seen how miners adjust their operations to be competitive while also earning revenue. Though the hash rate might drop in the days ahead, big miners won\u2019t be affected as much but will likely consolidate their positions. Meanwhile, small miners could be shaken off, leading to miner centralization over time. Over the long run, the hash rate will be a crucial metric. If prices rise as expected, miners will be incentivized to invest in new gear, boosting the network security.

However, the spotlight was shared with the debut of the Runes protocol, which stirred controversy by congesting the network with high fees and meme coins. Runes Make Bitcoin Network Congestion Worse Runes ignited fervor within the crypto community, presenting itself as a means to infuse the meme coins into the Bitcoin blockchain. This protocol diverges from the BRC-20 token standard by leveraging an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. It allows the creation of altcoins through an \u201cetching\u201d process directly on the network. Casey Rodarmor, the protocol\u2019s creator, described Runes as designed for degens and meme coins while emphasizing its simplicity, efficiency, and security. \u201cIt is a legitimate competitor to Taproot Assets and RGB. The protocol is self-contained and has no dependencies on ordinals or inscriptions, making it extremely simple\u2026 I\u2019m highly skeptical of \u201cserious\u201d tokens, but runes is without a doubt a \u201cserious\u201d token protocol,\u201d Rodarmor added. Runes\u2019 introduction prompted a surge in Bitcoin network activity, resulting in congestion and heightened fees. Indeed, a minimum transaction fee now exceeds 840 sat/vB, equivalent to approximately $76. It also bolstered block revenue, averaging 21.74 BTC per block post-halving. Bitcoin Transaction Fees. Source: Blockchain.com Jameson Lopp, the co-founder of Casa, pointed out that these high fees have allowed Bitcoin miners to surpass their all-time high daily transaction fees of $24 million.

This pivotal event, the fourth since Bitcoin\u2019s creation, has stimulated extensive discussions about its implications for miners, investors, and the broader market landscape. Bitcoin Miners Upgrade As the block reward halved from 6.25 BTC to 3.12 BTC, miners initially face significant challenges. Omar Lopez, Founder of Cripto It Club, shared with BeInCrypto that a portion of the miners will be compelled to shut down their operations as continuing becomes economically unfeasible. Some will even find themselves operating at a loss. This scenario embodies a form of game theory, according to Lopez. Initially, if 1,000 miners are profitably mining 6.25 BTC, the profitability equation shifts dramatically post-halving when the reward drops to 3.12 BTC, spread among the same number of miners. This change forces those miners who cannot sustain losses to cease their operations. Eventually, this attrition might reduce the number to, say, 600 miners. For these remaining miners, the reduced competition for the 3.12 BTC could restore profitability, stabilizing the mining landscape. \u201cMiners follow the price of Bitcoin, not the other way around. If the price of Bitcoin is low and it\u2019s not profitable to mine, several miners will turn off their machines. Until it becomes profitable for those remaining to compete for the 3.12 BTC. Game theory in all its glory,\u201d Lopez explained. Bitcoin Miner Revenue. Source: Glassnode For this reason, some Bitcoin miners are increasingly investing in state-of-the-art technologies. Hao Yang, Head of Financial Products at Bybit, highlights the strategic shift towards more sophisticated mining solutions. Many miners upgrade their equipment to newer models that deliver greater mining power with reduced energy consumption. This strategy is typically feasible for the more professionalized Bitcoin miners who possess the necessary capital. By doing so, they are able to enhance their profitability, particularly during the challenging initial days following the Bitcoin halving. \u201cMiners are focusing on energy efficiency and diversification by investing in next-generation equipment like three nanometer mining rigs, which can increase hash rate to 3.4 exahash per second, enhancing capacity without a proportional increase in energy consumption,\u201d Yang told BeInCrypto. This upgrade not only aids in sustaining operations but also contributes to overall efficiency in the mining process. Therefore, it ensures that miners remain competitive post-halving.

Source: Glassnode Further emphasizing sustainability, miners are adopting energy-efficient technologies and integrating their operations into broader energy systems. This approach includes exploring renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and even harvesting energy from waste products. These are becoming popular options to reduce the environmental impact of mining operations. Rampant Demand for BTC Moreover, Yang notes significant changes in the Bitcoin market\u2019s structure, particularly with the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These have played a crucial role in merging Bitcoin with traditional financial markets. \u201cThe ETFs have been an important way that traditional investors can interact with Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier in a way that is regulated and familiar. In this sense, these financial instruments have proved that Bitcoin is here to stay, that it\u2019s not going to zero, that it can and will play a part in our future financial system,\u201d Yang added. This integration has not only stabilized price volatility and demonstrated Bitcoin\u2019s enduring presence in the financial ecosystem. It has also opened the floodgates to meet the growing demand from institutional investors. Collectively, spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold over 837,700 BTC, worth $53.61 billion. Consequently, this has significantly enhanced market liquidity, according to Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-Founder of Ledn. \u201cThis is the first halving where spot Bitcoin ETFs are live in the market, unlocking an avalanche of institutional demand. So far, it looks like the conditions are set for this halving to have a similar impact on price as previous ones have,\u201d Di Bartolomeo told BeInCrypto. Bitcoin ETF Historical Holdings. Source: CryptoQuant Although immediate price surges post-halving are not always evident, the general consensus is that the halving will positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s value in the long run like it has done historically. During the initial Bitcoin halving on November 28, 2012, the price stood at $12 and later soared to a high of $1,242, representing an impressive increase of 9,937%. The second halving, which occurred on July 16, 2016, started with Bitcoin priced at $664, and it ultimately climbed to $19,804, reflecting a 2,903% rise. The latest halving, dated May 11, 2020, saw Bitcoin at $8,571, with its peak later reaching $68,997, an increase of 705%. \u201cHistorically, price movement has been fairly muted around the halving itself but there has been a major price run-up 9-12 months afterwards. This seemed to be driven by Bitcoin miners earning less Bitcoin to sell on the market, relative to the demand for Bitcoin. As such, the halving has been a \u2018buy after the news\u2019 event,\u201d Andy Fajar Handika, CEO at Loka Mining, told BeInCrypto. Read more: What Happened at the Last Bitcoin Halving?

Through comprehensive training programs, WorkML.ai aims to qualify annotators to produce high-quality Metadata, essential for enhancing AI models. Annotators will be compensated in WML tokens for their contributions, creating a dynamic ecosystem. This platform not only democratizes participation in the development of AI but also ensures a seamless and efficient flow of services and rewards across borders, marking a transformative step forward in the industry. Through their deep engagement with the development of AI models, they unearthed several critical bottlenecks. The initial challenge emerged from handling vast data sets, a conundrum adeptly resolved by Nvidia. However, a less apparent but equally significant bottleneck persists, discernible only to those intimately involved in the AI training processes. This hidden challenge lies in the meticulous preparation of Metadata, an essential component that accompanies the primary data fed into the models, shaping the landscape of AI development with its complexity. Business Value of WorkML.ai project Essential Data Needs: Business projects and startups creating AI products require data and Metadata to train their neural networks. The accuracy of these predictions hinges on the quality and precision of this information. Business projects require millions of Metadata units for training AI models. This represents an extremely complex and costly task. Challenge of Metadata Complexity: The process of obtaining high-quality Metadata presents a significant bottleneck, illustrating the complexity of the task. WorkML.ai conducted an analysis (research link) and discovered that to obtain 35 million units of high-quality Metadata, it would take one person 12,345 years to process such an amount. Cost Implications: Gathering and processing high-quality Metadata can be prohibitively expensive, adding a substantial cost to AI development. The cost of creating the same 35 million units of Metadata could exceed 20 million dollars. Global Annotation Hub: WorkML.ai introduces a revolutionary global annotation hub, facilitating the creation of Metadata by mobilizing a vast network of annotators worldwide. This hub significantly reduces the time and cost associated with data annotation. Optimized Approach: Our approach is to optimize the entire Metadata generation process. At the first stage, we try to get them automatically using trained neural networks \u2013 this data is necessarily checked by a human validator. At the second stage, if automatic Metadata creation is not possible, annotators are connected to the work, which perform markup, and then their work is checked by a combination of AI and human validators. Efficient Solution: WorkML.ai offers a solution that is ten times cheaper and twenty-five times faster than traditional methods, addressing both cost and speed barriers effectively. For instance, a task that would traditionally take over a millennium with a single person can be completed in just a week with thousands of annotators working around the clock. Cryptocurrency Integration: The project incorporates cryptocurrency, utilizing the WML token for internal payments and annotator remunerations. This integration not only streamlines transactions but also provides additional incentives through systems like Proof of Stake (PoS), Humans Proof of Stake (H-PoS) and Humans Proof of Work (H-PoW). Revenue and Cost Reduction: The platform\u2019s innovative use of a large, trained annotator workforce and cryptocurrency payments provides a low-risk, highly profitable model for both the company and its stakeholders, ensuring a steady revenue stream and reducing costs by about tenfold. Crypto Value of WorkML.ai project WML Token Launch: The introduction of the WML token is crucial for facilitating internal payments and rewarding participants within the ecosystem. Proof of Stake (PoS): Provides variable payouts, rewarding token holders based on the amount of their stake, incentivizing long-term holding and investment. Human\u2019s Proof of Work (H-PoW): Rewards annotators based on the quality and quantity of their work, directly influencing their compensation. This mechanism aligns the incentives of annotators with the quality of data annotation. Human\u2019s Proof of Stake (H-PoS): An innovative feature that offers double payouts for those who reinvest their earnings obtained through Human\u2019s Proof of Work (H-PoW), significantly increasing rewards for active participants. Perpetual Discounts: Payments made with WML tokens for services on the platform receive perpetual discounts, enhancing the token\u2019s liquidity and appealing to users to transact using WML. Three-Level Referral System: A multi-tiered referral program rewards users who help expand the community by inviting new annotators and customers, fostering a growing and engaged network. Token Growth Potential: Given the high business value and innovative features of the project, there is a potential for the WML token to increase in value by more than ten times. Airdrops: The budget includes 2% of all tokens allocated for airdrops, providing an opportunity to earn free tokens and engage a wider audience in the project\u2019s ecosystem. About WorkML.ai WorkML.ai is a revolutionary project developed by Advanced AI Solutions Inc., founded by Michael Bogachev and Denis Davydov.

This was primarily triggered by the mounting speculation around the Bitcoin halving event. This tumultuous period serves as a fertile ground for crucial insights and strategic adaptations in investment practices. Volatility Strikes Pre-Bitcoin Halving Rossmarie Davila, a seasoned crypto financial advisor, gave BeInCrypto insights into the best practices for navigating these turbulent times. When constructing an investment portfolio, she suggests having a clear objective for each asset on a short and long-term basis. Davila highlights the importance of a well-defined strategy as Bitcoin\u2019s inherent volatility demands a nuanced approach. Indeed, this year\u2019s halving has already significantly influenced Bitcoin\u2019s market, driving prices to an all-time peak of $73,737 in March. However, the subsequent weeks brought volatility, with Bitcoin experiencing a sharp 20% price correction and some altcoins plummeting by over 70%. Given the high volatility, Davila strongly advises newcomers to the cryptocurrency market to proceed with caution. \u201cThe best thing to do is not to panic and rush out to buy like crazy, because Bitcoin is volatile. I think a good advice is to allocate a fixed amount each month and buy at the average price, and in the meantime, see how you feel about these highly volatile investments. With a clear strategy, market noise should not cause me anxiety,\u201d Davila told BeInCrypto. Read more: Crypto Portfolio Management: A Beginner\u2019s Guide Crypto Capital Flows.

The reduced Bitcoin supply invariably leads to price increases due to demand \u2014 classic supply and demand dynamics. If an investment portfolio aligns with expectations, it is recommendable to maintain one\u2019s course. Otherwise, Davila suggests investors should consider reallocating or increasing holdings after price corrections, but never during peak values. It is important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by many external factors and is difficult to predict with certainty. Still, following previous Bitcoin halvings, price typically stabilizes after an initial surge as capital flows into altcoins. Managing Emotions and Expectations Addressing the impact on investors, especially novices, Davila emphasizes the potential psychological strain. Reduction in Bitcoin supply can cause anxiety among newcomers, compounded by frequent and sensational news coverage. This fear of missing out can drive ill-considered decisions. She points out that market sentiment, as gauged by the fear and greed index, currently indicates \u201cgreed,\u201d suggesting an overvaluation and a potential forthcoming correction.

This anticipated event reduces the supply, traditionally escalating Bitcoin\u2019s price due to its increased scarcity. As the 2024 halving takes place, industry leaders shares crucial insights. They highlight the impact this event has on trading strategies and the broader investment landscape. Immediate Effects Post-Halving John Patrick Mullin, CEO of real-world assets (RWA) Layer 1 blockchain MANTRA, told BeInCrypto about the immediate effects of the Bitcoin halving. He predicts increased market volatility due to the sudden reduction in block rewards. \u201cAfter a halving, short-term traders should be prepared for increased volatility. The reduced block reward can lead to immediate market reactions, and traders should watch for potential price swings to capitalize on quick profits or mitigate losses,\u201d Mullin explained. This period of fluctuation presents opportunities and risks, requiring investors to be highly vigilant and responsive to market signals. Mullin notes the importance of monitoring the hash rate and miner activity after the halving. A decrease in hash rate following a halving could signal miner capitulation, which may precipitate a short-term decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price. This scenario offers strategic entry points for investors or could serve as a cautionary signal to delay further investments. Bitcoin Hash Rate. Source: Glassnode While the halving stirs considerable activity and speculation among short-term traders, Mullin advocates a different approach for long-term investors. He suggests that they \u201cmight consider holding or gradually accumulating more Bitcoin,\u201d focusing on the enduring potential for price appreciation as the newly constrained supply of Bitcoin interacts with steady or increasing demand. Likewise, Nash Lee, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) MerlinSwap, believes that long-term investors should look beyond immediate fluctuations, anticipating the substantial price gains that have historically followed halving events. \u201cThe decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s supply may lead to price increases, prompting a long-term consideration of increasing Bitcoin holdings. Compared to other altcoins, Bitcoin exhibits less price volatility, coupled with bullish news such as the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, making it advisable to consider increasing BTC holdings relative to other assets,\u201d Lee told BeInCrypto. Bitcoin Performance Post-Halving. Source: Glassnode Looking back at historical data surrounding supply and price dynamics during previous Bitcoin halving events provides valuable context. In the first halving event on November 28, 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s price was $12, surging to a peak of $1,242, a staggering 9,937% increase. Similarly, the second halving event on July 16, 2016, saw the price at $664, eventually reaching a peak of $19,804, marking a 2,903% increase. The most recent halving on May 11, 2020, witnessed a price of $8,571, with the subsequent peak hitting $68,997, an 705% increase. Read more: What Happened at the Last Bitcoin Halving? Predictions for 2024 According to Kristian Haralampiev, Products Lead at crypto platform Nexo, these historical trends demonstrate the potential for significant price appreciation following halving events. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature, highlighted by the reduction in newly issued supply during halving events, enhances its appeal as a hedge against global inflation. This characteristic solidifies its status as a desirable asset, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. Consequently, attention intensifies around halving events, further bolstering Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a store of value,\u201d Haralampiev said in an interview with BeInCrypto. When Altcoin Season Starts The discussion extends beyond Bitcoin. Mullin points out that post-halving, the cryptocurrency market often sees a shift where investor focus broadens to include altcoins. \u201cThe increased attention and capital flow into the market can lead to a so-called \u2018altcoin season,\u2019 where altcoins experience significant price increases after Bitcoin\u2019s initial surge. Once the hype around the Bitcoin halving fades, investors might look to diversify. This strategy should be approached particularly if investors search for \u2018the next big thing\u2019 following Bitcoin\u2019 bull run\u2019s rally,\u201d Mullin affirmed. This broadened perspective is crucial as the market adapts and recalibrates following the halving. Historically, as Bitcoin\u2019s price stabilizes after its initial post-halving surge, altcoins begin to attract attention. Indeed, a parabolic altcoin season usually unfolds when Bitcoin\u2019s price stabilizes after its initial post-halving surge, prompting investors to seek higher returns. If Bitcoin\u2019s price significantly increases and its market dominance rises, a subsequent reversal in this dominance could lead investors to start taking profits and reallocating funds to altcoins. This pattern was observed after the 2020 halving when Bitcoin\u2019s dominance peaked at 73%. Should similar trends recur in 2024, a shift from Bitcoin to altcoins might be expected.

Investors contemplating such moves should meticulously evaluate altcoins based on their use cases, technological foundations, development teams, community support, and market positions. Additionally, monitoring market sentiments and trends is crucial, as altcoins tend to rally when the market is bullish about new technologies or projects. Altcoin Season Indicator. Source: Glassnode However, due to their higher volatility and risk compared to Bitcoin, investors must carefully assess their risk tolerance and consider diversifying their portfolios to effectively manage these risks. Lee maintains that conducting comprehensive research is essential to mitigate the risks of succumbing to fear of missing out (FOMO) and investing in lesser-known altcoins, which could carry significant risks. \u201cAfter the Bitcoin halving, some people believe that altcoins offer more attractive investment opportunities. However, altcoins are known for their higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, requiring careful evaluation. It\u2019s essential to thoroughly research the projects and backgrounds to ensure understanding of the investment\u2019s value and potential returns,\u201d Lee emphasized. Looking ahead, the implications of the halving extend into the broader financial ecosystem. The insights from Mullin, Haralampiev, and Lee suggest that the halving reinforces Bitcoin\u2019s status as the leading cryptocurrency. It also acts as a catalyst for increased market dominance and subsequent investment shifts into altcoins.

The group is responsible for attacks on over 250 businesses and critical infrastructure entities since March 2023, primarily in North America, Europe, and Australia. Akira\u2019s Evolution and Attack Techniques Akira threat actors have amassed an estimated $42 million in ransom payments as of January 1, 2024. They have targeted various industries, raising significant concerns for organizations worldwide. Initially written in C++, Akira originally encrypted files with a .akira extension. However, variations have emerged. Starting August 2023, the group deployed the Rust-based Megazord ransomware, adding a .powerranges extension to its encrypted files. Some attacks now involve deploying both Megazord and Akira variants for increased impact. Read more: Top Cryptocurrency Scams in 2024 The FBI and cybersecurity researchers have traced Akira\u2019s initial access methods. Commonly, they exploit known vulnerabilities in Cisco VPN services that lack multifactor authentication (MFA). They also gain entry through remote desktop protocols, spear phishing, and compromised credentials. Once inside a network, Akira attackers create new domain accounts to maintain persistence. They then leverage credential scraping tools like Mimikatz to escalate privileges. System reconnaissance and the identification of domain controllers are performed using tools like SoftPerfect and Advanced IP Scanner, along with native Windows commands. Akira actors frequently disable security software before moving laterally across compromised networks. PowerTool has been observed turning off antivirus processes to evade detection. To steal sensitive data, Akira operators extensively use exfiltration tools like FileZilla, WinSCP, and cloud storage services. They establish command and control channels with AnyDesk, RustDesk, and Cloudflare Tunnel. True to the double-extortion model, Akira actors encrypt systems after stealing data. Their ransom note includes a unique code and a .onion URL for contacting them. They don\u2019t specify an initial ransom amount, pressuring victims into negotiations. Ransom payments are paid in Bitcoin to crypto wallet addresses provided by the threat actors. Furthermore, to apply extra pressure, Akira threat actors threaten to publish exfiltrated data on the Tor network and, in some instances, have called victimized companies, according to FBI reporting. The FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC-NL have issued comprehensive recommendations for the Akira threat actors\u2019 system and network discovery techniques.

However, there is now potential for an upswing. After our prior caution regarding a substantial correction in Solana when the price hovered around $190, the price has indeed declined by approximately 39%. Consequently, Solana has reached the correction target of around $130. Solana\u2019s Rough Patch: A 43.3% Decrease in Price The correction in SOL\u2019s price has been relatively moderate thus far, with the price dropping by over 43% this month. Consequently, the histogram of the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is also beginning to trend lower in a bearish direction this month. However, the MACD lines maintain a bullish crossover in the monthly chart, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is gradually transitioning into neutral territory. Solana (SOL/USDT) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview In summary, the bullish upward trend remains sustained as long as Solana maintains support above the golden ratio level at approximately $85.

Analyzing Golden Ratio Support Impact Significant Fibonacci support lies within the range of $125 to $130 for the SOL price. Maintaining above this range would signal a strong bullish sentiment. Alternatively, the 50-week EMA at approximately $85 stands as an additional support level. Weekly chart indicators portray a bearish outlook, with the MACD histogram trending downward and the MACD lines nearing a bearish crossover. Solana (SOL/USDT) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Meanwhile, the RSI remains in neutral territory. Forecasting Solana: Key Fibonacci Resistance Levels to Watch If Solana rebounds from the Golden Ratio support around $125, it could encounter significant resistance at the 50-day EMA around $156.6. Breaking through the golden ratio at $175 is necessary to halt the corrective movement, although horizontal resistance is present between $162.5 and $170. Indicators offer mixed signals: the MACD histogram has shown bullish momentum for three days, and there\u2019s a golden crossover in the EMAs, indicating a bullish trend in the short to medium term. However, the RSI remains neutral, and the MACD lines are currently bearishly crossed. Solana (SOL/USDT) Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Should the current Fibonacci support falter, Solana may find support at the 200-day EMA near $108 before potentially correcting to the golden ratio at approximately $85. Bearish Pattern: Death Cross Emerges on Solana\u2019s 4-Hour Chart The recent formation of a death cross in Solana\u2019s 4-hour chart confirms a short-term bearish trend, indicating a potential downward movement toward the Golden Ratio support zone between $125 and $130. Despite this, the MACD lines remain bullish, and the RSI hovers in neutral territory. Solana (SOL/USDT) Price Chart.

Solana vs. Bitcoin: Solana Hits Crucial Fibonacci Support Level Against Bitcoin, Solana currently finds itself at Fibonacci support levels ranging between approximately 0.0021 BTC and 0.0023 BTC. This presents a potential opportunity for a bullish rebound.

The tokenization project will use the TON blockchain. Toncoin price rose as TON Foundation and Tether partnered to bring USDT to TON blockchain. Telegram is taking a major step in its blockchain technology adoption with a new effort announced today during Token2049 Dubai. The popular messaging app\u2019s co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov revealed this next step on Friday. According to Durov, the company\u2019s tokenization journey now includes plans to tokenize Telegram stickers and emojis as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Telegram plans tokenized stickers Telegram\u2019s initiative follows the notable success of tokenized usernames and anonymous numbers. Already, users can earn up to 95% of revenue that comes from the sale of the unique usernames. Tokenization is the next step in Telegram\u2019s growth, Durov said, highlighting the role blockchain technology is set to play in this. The project will \u201cexclusively\u201d leverage The Open Network (TON) blockchain, the Telegram CEO noted. Commenting on the success recorded so far, Durov said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stay there. We want to go further. You see, we believe in socially-relevant NFTs. We believe in NFTs that are deeply integrated into human culture, into human interaction, into our communication. NFTs that you can see tens of billions of times and have a lot of potential to spread virally. These are the right NFTs. That\u2019s why the next step that we are going to undertake is tokenizing Telegram stickers.\u201d Toncoin (TON), the native token of TON blockchain, soared in recent months after Telegram rolled out its \u2018Ad Network\u2019. Users can now pay for in-platform adverts, with the initiative offering a 50% share of ad-revenue to channel owners and creators. Earlier today, TON price rose sharply to $7.20 amid the NFT news.

FLOKI dips as the threat of war looms. BONK remains resilient despite sell pressure. Milei Moneda\u2019s ($MEDA) presale is attracting a growing number of investors thanks to its potential profit margins. Binance extends support for Floki (FLOKI) as the cryptocurrency gains popularity. Meanwhile, a reputable fintech adopts Bonk (BONK). How impressive is $MEDA\u2019s presale gain? And is it the best cryptocurrency to buy ahead of Floki and Bonk? Let\u2019s dig into the data. Economize Like Milei: Invest in $MEDA Milei Moneda\u2019s presale offers 60% gains Milei Moneda is a new meme coin that combines humor, politics, and blockchain technology. The project has recently become popular due to its lucrative presale. The presale is currently in Stage 2, and the $MEDA token is sold for $0.0125. Stage 1 investors have already earned a 25% profit. They\u2019re forecast to gain a total of 100% on their initial investment when the presale ends. Similarly, Stage 2 investors are forecast to earn a 60% profit when $MEDA becomes $0.020 at the end of the presale. In addition, investors become a part of Milei Moneda\u2019s vibrant community on Reddit, Discord, and X. They can meet other members and participate in giveaways and Q&A sessions. Also, Milei Moneda investors get voting rights and access to exclusive NFT collections. They also earn NFT staking rewards and discounts. Furthermore, $MEDA is a deflationary token. Supply is fixed at 500 million, while five percent of this supply will be burned to maintain price stability. Finally, Milei Moneda is protected through locked liquidity, smart contract audits, and zero team allocations. All these reveal why many analysts and investors are suggesting $MEDA could be the best crypto to invest in now. Economize Like Milei: Invest in $MEDA Binance introduces new Floki pairs On March 26, 2024, Binance announced that it would list new Floki trading pairs. This move comes as meme coins take center stage, consequently increasing Floki\u2019s popularity. The new pair, FLOKI/USDC, will be added to Binance Spot on March 28. Bot services will also be available to users who want to trade the pair. Furthermore, clients based in the USA and its territories, Canada, Japan, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Netherlands, and any non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine won\u2019t be able to trade the new Floki pair. Since the news broke, Floki has plummeted 42.7%, falling from $0.000241 to $0.000138. This significant slump has been attributed to investors seeking safety in more stable investments after tensions escalated between Iran and Israel. Analysts predict that Floki will remain around $0.000153 as long as the political situation in the Middle East remains unstable. Bonk gets support from TradFi firm On February 16, popular fintech Revolut announced that it was listing Bonk on its platform. Bonk is one of the Solana meme coins driving the current meme coin frenzy and will be the first from Solana. The meme coin will become accessible to Revolut\u2019s 30 million customers, increasing adoption. Revolut will also institute an education program for Bonk. Plans are in place to distribute 93 billion Bonk to users during this education campaign. Analysts say this development signals Bonk\u2019s increasing mainstream acceptance. This acceptance is evident in Bonk\u2019s increased price. The token gained 157% in less than one month after the announcement. It increased from $0.000014 to $0.000036 in. However, a market-wide sell-off triggered by the political tensions in the Middle East has ensured that Bonk is back to $0.000014. However, analysts predict that Bonk could reach $0.000067 after the Bitcoin Halving. This makes the token one of the important altcoins this year. Conclusion Milei Moneda\u2019s successful presale, which has sold over 59 million tokens to date, is challenging existing meme coins FLOKI and BONK, with early investors already experiencing 25% ROI & those that invest in its current presale stage 2 projected to gain a 60% ROI. The success of Milei Moneda is causing analysts to speculate that this coin could have major upside potential. Got $MEDA curiosity? Visit us or chat on Telegram for the inside scoop.

OKB\u2019s price has increased 4.9% on the 14-day price chart. OKX\u2019s launch of the X Layer network might be responsible for the recent gains. Rebel Satoshi Arcade is on the rise, with its crypto ICO selling over 355 million tokens in stage 1. The crypto market witnessed a massive shift lately that left several top crypto coins gasping for air. The likes of Celestia were among the first to feel the heat, as it dropped 12.7% on the weekly price chart. Meanwhile, OKB and Rebel Satoshi Arcade are currently in the green, thanks to recent developments in their respective ecosystems. Rebel Satoshi Arcade ($RECQ) presale soars due to its decentralized gaming platform Rebel Satoshi Arcade ($RECQ) is a new DeFi project that has hit a remarkable milestone, selling 80% of the tokens for stage one of its crypto ICO in a short amount of time. Rebel Satoshi is building a decentralized gaming ecosystem where members are at the top of the food chain. The gaming ecosystem does not have a centralized authority that makes the decision. Instead, the members of the community make the decisions; they have a say in the platform\u2019s operations, the kind of crypto games that are released, and so many other rights. Apart from being a decentralized platform, Rebel Satoshi Arcade operates on a play-to-earn model \u2013 gamers are rewarded for playing games, giving them a source of passive income. Finally, Rebel Satoshi Arcade has a marketplace where players can buy several assets like new gaming tools, upgrade their weapons, and even add the best NFTs to their collections. The token used for these transactions is the $RECQ token. In addition to its use as a transaction token, the $RECQ token gives its holders access to top NFTs and new games that are yet to hit the market, you can join before that for only $0.0037 per RECQ token. Celestia (TIA) price continues to consolidate Since reaching an all-time high of $20.85 on February 10, 2024, Celestia (TIA) has been on a downtrend. The alt coin is now trading between $8.52 and $11.88 in April after falling 12.7% in the past week. There has been a relentless battle between bulls and bears, with neither showing dominance. As a result, TIA continues to consolidate at the range of $8-11. Nonetheless, Celestia stayed in the top 50 cryptocurrencies, trading at $10.5 with a market cap of $1.88 billion. OKB (OKB) price surges as OKX launches its own L2 network The native token of the OKX crypto exchange, OKB (OKB), has been bullish, defying the bearish trend in the crypto market. The price of OKB recently recorded a new all-time high at $73.80 in mid-March but couldn\u2019t retain the bullish momentum above $70. Retracing with the rest of the crypto market, OKB has dropped back to the $50.61 \u2013 $61.16 price zone. However, following the announcement from OKX about the release of the layer-2 (L2 network) called X layer, OKB has regained bullish momentum. The altcoin is up by 9% since April 13, forcing a retest of the $60 resistance. In summary Celestia is still among the top 50 cryptocurrencies in the market despite its poor price movement. Meanwhile, OKB and Rebel Satoshi Arcade are two top altcoins that are in the green. While the recent development around OKX is responsible for OKB\u2019s latest surge, that of Rebel Satoshi Arcade is its gaming platform.

TON Network\u2019s integration of USDT boosts Toncoin price by 12%. Bitbot\u2019s AI-powered trading platform and $BITBOT token offer innovative solutions. As the cryptocurrency market navigates through turbulent waters, TRON investors are exploring alternative options amidst a legal battle involving Justin Sun, the founder of TRON (TRX). The recent lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Sun has prompted investors to seek refuge in projects such as the TON Network and Bitbot. SEC\u2019s lawsuit casts a shadow over TRON (TRX) The SEC\u2019s legal action against Justin Sun has sent shockwaves through the TRON community. The accusations of selling unregistered securities through TRON\u2019s native token (TRX) and BitTorrent\u2019s token (BTT) have cast doubt on the future of these assets. Sun\u2019s alleged involvement in deceptive practices, including wash trading and undisclosed paid celebrity endorsements, has further exacerbated concerns among investors. As the legal battle unfolds, investors are grappling with the uncertainty surrounding TRON\u2019s regulatory status and the potential ramifications for its market value. The outcome of this lawsuit could redefine the regulatory landscape for TRON and other cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased scrutiny and tighter controls on their operations. USDT support added to TON Network boosting Toncoin price Amidst the regulatory turmoil facing TRON, the recent announcement of Tether (USDT) support on the TON Network has injected a sense of optimism into the cryptocurrency market. Tether\u2019s decision to integrate its stablecoin with TON expands its presence across the crypto sphere, providing users with a seamless experience for peer-to-peer payments and value transfers. In response to this development, Toncoin has experienced a surge in price, reaching $7.09 and marking a 12% daily increase. This bullish momentum reflects investors\u2019 confidence in the potential of TON Network and the broader ecosystem it encompasses. The integration of USDT on TON not only enhances liquidity but also opens up new avenues for decentralized applications across various verticals. Bitbot: revolutionizing cryptocurrency trading Just like Toncoin, Bitbot, a sophisticated Telegram-based AI-powered trading bot designed to enhance the trading experience, is also attracting investors\u2019 attention. Bitbot\u2019s platform provides users with real-time data, technical analysis, and seamless execution, levelling the playing field for both novice and experienced traders. At the heart of Bitbot\u2019s ecosystem is its native token, $BITBOT, which offers holders exclusive benefits such as revenue sharing and governance rights. The token is currently in its presale stage which has already raised $2,603,234 out of its $2,844,000 target, reflecting growing demand for Bitbot\u2019s innovative solutions. The current presale price is $0.0163 per token giving early investors an investment opportunity seeing that the price is set to increase to $0.0171 in the next presale stage. Conclusion As TRON investors navigate through uncertain waters, TON Network and new projects like Bitbot offer promising alternatives for those seeking stability and growth opportunities in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, as with any cryptocurrency investment, investors should conduct thorough research before investing owing to the extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin\u2019s recent price volatility highlights ongoing debates in the cryptocurrency market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has once again voiced his scepticism towards Bitcoin (BTC), dubbing it a \u2018Ponzi scheme\u2019 during an interview on Bloomberg TV. During his interview, Dimon reiterated his long-standing criticism of Bitcoin, stating that it lacks utility and legitimacy as a form of money. He described Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as \u201csimply not functional as currencies,\u201d emphasising his belief that they are essentially Ponzi schemes disguised as technological innovation. However, this is not the first time that the CEO is criticizing Bitocin. His scepticism towards Bitcoin is well-documented. He previously called Bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d and expressed concerns about its potential to facilitate illegal activities such as money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion due to its anonymity and lack of regulation. JPMorgan\u2019s involvement in Bitcoin ETFs It\u2019s notable that despite Dimon\u2019s vocal criticism of Bitcoin, JPMorgan has been actively involved in the cryptocurrency space. The banking giant has served as an Authorized Participant for BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and has participated in several blockchain-based projects over the years. Furthermore, despite Dimon\u2019s scepticism towards Bitcoin, the CEO acknowledged the potential value of certain aspects of blockchain technology, particularly those facilitating smart contracts although he maintained his stance that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin lack inherent value as currencies, echoing his previous sentiments on the matter. This juxtaposition highlights the nuanced approach within the banking giant towards cryptocurrency investments, even as its CEO expresses scepticism. Bitcoin (BTC) price market reaction Bitcoin\u2019s market performance has been subject to fluctuations in recent times. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price was $64,741.28, after experiencing a 4.92% increase in the last day, but it was still down 8.41% over the past seven days. Despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has recently surpassed $1.2 trillion, reflecting its continued growth and acceptance as an asset class.

The new partnership was announced today at TOKEN2049 in Dubai, one of the world\u2019s premier crypto conferences. Teams from Telos and Ponos Technology will take a hardware-software co-design approach that will help unlock new possibilities in terms of massive scalability, greater data protection and trustless interoperability for Ethereum users globally. Ponos Technology provides end-to-end optimized solutions for ZK proving, which is essentially achieved by leveraging FPGA acceleration, thus maximizing business value streams through cost-performance optimized computation by matching hardware-software co-designed modules and dedicated execution environments. The team includes a unique blend of experienced scientists and highly skilled industry experts that have accumulated deep technical knowledge on all aspects of ZKPs. Slobodan Lukovic, CEO and co-founder, Ponos Technology, said: \u201cZero Knowledge technology is going to become increasingly mainstream and can open the door to increased efficiency and security across so many industries. \u201cSimilarly to AI, steady enhancements in algorithms coupled with advancements in underlying hardware infrastructures will enable commoditization of ZKPs and result in the technology being widely adopted in the near future.\u201d Telos will also be working with several other new partners during the development cycle, including: Digital M.O.B. \u2013 One of the strongest Ethereum developer teams in the world, having worked on projects including MetaMask, MakerDAO and Gnosis, among others. ATKA \u2013 A Paris-based end-to-end web3 incubator who helped incubate world class projects such as Morpho and Mangrove, and whom Telos announced a strategic partnership with in March 2024. Cometh \u2013 An award-winning dev team led by ETH France President Jerome de Tychey, who joined Telos as a technical EVM advisor also in March 2024. Telos Executive Director John Lilic, who helped lead pioneering teams at ConsenSys and Polygon in addition to being a Top 50 Web3 angel investor, will help coordinate and support the transformation. He will work closely with Alberto Garoffolo, Head of ZK technology at Telos and co-author of the SNARKtor whitepaper, and Jesse Schulman, CTO and Head of Engineering at Telos. Announcing the new partnership, John Lilic said: \u201cFundamentally, Ethereum will need to take a hardware-software co-design approach in order to realize zkEVM performance at tremendous scale. \u201cThat\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking with Ponos Technology and our growing partner network as we build a hardware-accelerated zkEVM L2. We believe that this formula, alongside the exciting work our team is doing with recursive proofs via SNARKtor, is going to offer compelling services to the Ethereum community and beyond.\u201d Telos was created in 2018 through a \u201cfair drop\u201d network launch that did not include an ICO nor token sale.

The countdown to this event shows that it could happen around the final hours of Friday evening if you are located in the Americas or Saturday morning if you are in Asia or Europe. According to the market metrics, the event is much anticipated and should be discounted well in advance of its actual occurrence. In contrast to unpredictable overnight barrages of rockets in the heat of the Middle East, the halving event has a clear outcome\u2014the amount of BTC rewards that miners get for completing a block will be reduced in half to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25. This will inevitably lead to less supply from miners, but does it change the liquidity of the overall market? We will attempt to answer that question in the coming paragraphs, and while at it, we will also highlight some challenges related to the current geopolitical landscape and the resulting jittery market conditions we have recently observed. Are Previous Halvings Linked to Liquidity Squeezes? Every time 210,000 blocks are mined, the Bitcoin network's protocol cuts in half the amount of new rewards. As highlighted by the institutional research team at Coinbase, this means that the newly minted supply will drop from 900 Bitcoins per day to 450 Bitcoins per day. At current market prices ($65,000 per BTC), this equates to roughly $30,000,000 worth of new supply per day or $900,000,000 per month. These figures are rather low compared to the average daily trading volumes across crypto exchanges, especially since the launch of BTC ETF trading, which triggered increased interest in the asset class. The amount of tradable Bitcoin has also been on the rise during the recent bull run that accelerated since early Q4 2023. According to the team at Coinbase Institutional Research, active BTC supply, defined as Bitcoin moved in the past three months, rose to 1.3 million. This figure is in comparison to 150,000, which was mined during that time. In a statement shared with Finance Magnates, Coinbase's Research Analyst, David Han, mentioned that the decline in BTC mining issuance could create new supply-side dynamics that are constructive in the longer term. Han expressed his doubts as to whether that can result in an imminent supply crunch: \u201cWe find that the largest contributors to increased BTC supply during bull markets come from long-term wallets beginning to activate instead of from newly mined BTC.\u201d Crypto and Fiat Liquidity Cycles \u2013 the Signal and the Noise A widely held belief in the cryptocurrency community is that halving events are usually followed by a significant rally in the value of their digital assets. While there is some historical correlation to corroborate this notion, science has long established - correlation does not imply causation. The logical fallacy where two events that occur at a similar time have a cause-effect relationship is at the center of spurious relationships - two events can be correlated, but that connection may not be causal. With only three halving events behind us and a fourth one brewing, one can observe correlations, but not necessarily cause-effect relationships. Halving events don\u2019t perfectly coincide with central bank liquifying cycles, but as the chart below shows, there is some food for thought for risk-management teams and traders alike. Less than 7 hours to the #Bitcoin halving ⏳Where do you see the price of $BTC going next?Catch the countdown here: https://t.co/hBaJI9Juo9 pic.twitter.com/BfrAfkBh3I \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) April 19, 2024 Around the first halving in 2012, the Fed launched the third chapter of its post-financial crisis quantitative easing program (QE3), shortly followed by the first US debt ceiling crisis and the loss of the reserve currency issuer\u2019s AAA rating. The second one, in 2016, was followed by the Bank of England\u2019s post-Brexit ramp-up of bond buying in tandem with the ECB\u2019s asset purchase program. Fast-forward to 2020, and we all remember the central bank and fiscal policy bazookas firing left and right with fiat liquidity so ample that it ultimately caused the sharpest spike in inflationary pressures globally since the 1970s. Geopolitical Blocks It was an early morning in the Middle East, as a well-telegraphed attack by Iran had been unleashed upon Israel. With all other financial markets closed, it was up to crypto to reflect the current state of mind (or compute). The old Wall Street saying, \u201cup the stairs, down the elevator,\u201d came to mind as BTC and ETH dropped in tandem in rapidly dwindling liquidity conditions. That night, Coinbase registered about $2 billion worth of liquidations, the company\u2019s institutional research team highlighted in a recent weekly market call. In contrast to the rather gradual price action that unfolded in the aftermath of the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas, the Iranian attack, despite being well-telegraphed before the weekend, did result in material price action across the crypto market. At one point, Pax Gold, a crypto token supposed to be fully backed by gold, spiked about $1000 at a time when the physical gold market, which is underpinning the coin's value, wasn\u2019t open. The magnitude of the attack certainly surprised market participants, while some automatic \u201cstop trading\u201d commands must have been unleashed across algorithmic trading strategies. Events centered around geopolitical stress have certainly caused some leveraged players to rethink, not only in the crypto market. Fed chair Powell\u2019s higher rates for a longer period re-pivot raise questions about a widely expected easing of monetary policy. Speech by Chair Powell on the economic outlook @StanfordGSB: https://t.co/y6oLUN0LYwWatch live: https://t.co/a0ApMRHum2 \u2014 Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) April 3, 2024 To Bid, or Not to Bid As the halving cycles come and go, the impact of these events could lessen in time. Since most bitcoins have already been mined, the current market liquidity state is much more about the existing supply of BTC on the market than newly mined coins. A supply crunch overnight is the least likely event, and if very recent history is any guide, geopolitical tensions can create more volatility or liquidity waves on cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. Guided by risk-on and risk-off flows, cryptocurrencies have been defying the trend occasionally, but at their core they remain a high-risk asset with a digital store of value component behind it. Only time will tell whether or not that narrative has become a well-established characteristic, but so far, so good. As the halving event comes and passes us by, it is the central banks that will have the ball in their court - ready to do whatever it takes to address inflationary challenges or supply more fiat liquidity to the monetary system. With Bitcoin ETFs breaking new ground, the liquidity situation for the king of crypto has significantly improved. As David Han outlines: \u201cNet US spot ETFs inflows to date approximately offset the BTC that was mined in the previous six months.\u201d This article was written by Victor Golovtchenko at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"The long-awaited day of the 4th phase of Bitcoin's halving is looming in the cryptocurrency sector. The countdown to this event shows that it could happen around the final hours of Friday evening if you are located in the Americas or Saturday morning if you are in Asia or Europe. According to the market metrics, the event is much anticipated and should be discounted well in advance of its actual occurrence. In contrast to unpredictable overnight barrages of rockets in the heat of the Middle East, the halving event has a clear outcome\u2014the amount of BTC rewards that miners get for completing a block will be reduced in half to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25. This will inevitably lead to less supply from miners, but does it change the liquidity of the overall market? We will attempt to answer that question in the coming paragraphs, and while at it, we will also highlight some challenges related to the current geopolitical landscape and the resulting jittery market conditions we have recently observed. Are Previous Halvings Linked to Liquidity Squeezes? Every time 210,000 blocks are mined, the Bitcoin network's protocol cuts in half the amount of new rewards. As highlighted by the institutional research team at Coinbase, this means that the newly minted supply will drop from 900 Bitcoins per day to 450 Bitcoins per day. At current market prices ($65,000 per BTC), this equates to roughly $30,000,000 worth of new supply per day or $900,000,000 per month. These figures are rather low compared to the average daily trading volumes across crypto exchanges, especially since the launch of BTC ETF trading, which triggered increased interest in the asset class. The amount of tradable Bitcoin has also been on the rise during the recent bull run that accelerated since early Q4 2023. According to the team at Coinbase Institutional Research, active BTC supply, defined as Bitcoin moved in the past three months, rose to 1.3 million. This figure is in comparison to 150,000, which was mined during that time. In a statement shared with Finance Magnates, Coinbase's Research Analyst, David Han, mentioned that the decline in BTC mining issuance could create new supply-side dynamics that are constructive in the longer term. Han expressed his doubts as to whether that can result in an imminent supply crunch: \u201cWe find that the largest contributors to increased BTC supply during bull markets come from long-term wallets beginning to activate instead of from newly mined BTC.\u201d Crypto and Fiat Liquidity Cycles \u2013 the Signal and the Noise A widely held belief in the cryptocurrency community is that halving events are usually followed by a significant rally in the value of their digital assets. While there is some historical correlation to corroborate this notion, science has long established - correlation does not imply causation. The logical fallacy where two events that occur at a similar time have a cause-effect relationship is at the center of spurious relationships - two events can be correlated, but that connection may not be causal. With only three halving events behind us and a fourth one brewing, one can observe correlations, but not necessarily cause-effect relationships. Halving events don\u2019t perfectly coincide with central bank liquifying cycles, but as the chart below shows, there is some food for thought for risk-management teams and traders alike. Less than 7 hours to the #Bitcoin halving ⏳Where do you see the price of $BTC going next?Catch the countdown here: https://t.co/hBaJI9Juo9 pic.twitter.com/BfrAfkBh3I \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) April 19, 2024 Around the first halving in 2012, the Fed launched the third chapter of its post-financial crisis quantitative easing program (QE3), shortly followed by the first US debt ceiling crisis and the loss of the reserve currency issuer\u2019s AAA rating. The second one, in 2016, was followed by the Bank of England\u2019s post-Brexit ramp-up of bond buying in tandem with the ECB\u2019s asset purchase program. Fast-forward to 2020, and we all remember the central bank and fiscal policy bazookas firing left and right with fiat liquidity so ample that it ultimately caused the sharpest spike in inflationary pressures globally since the 1970s. Geopolitical Blocks It was an early morning in the Middle East, as a well-telegraphed attack by Iran had been unleashed upon Israel. With all other financial markets closed, it was up to crypto to reflect the current state of mind (or compute). The old Wall Street saying, \u201cup the stairs, down the elevator,\u201d came to mind as BTC and ETH dropped in tandem in rapidly dwindling liquidity conditions. That night, Coinbase registered about $2 billion worth of liquidations, the company\u2019s institutional research team highlighted in a recent weekly market call. In contrast to the rather gradual price action that unfolded in the aftermath of the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas, the Iranian attack, despite being well-telegraphed before the weekend, did result in material price action across the crypto market. At one point, Pax Gold, a crypto token supposed to be fully backed by gold, spiked about $1000 at a time when the physical gold market, which is underpinning the coin's value, wasn\u2019t open. The magnitude of the attack certainly surprised market participants, while some automatic \u201cstop trading\u201d commands must have been unleashed across algorithmic trading strategies. Events centered around geopolitical stress have certainly caused some leveraged players to rethink, not only in the crypto market. Fed chair Powell\u2019s higher rates for a longer period re-pivot raise questions about a widely expected easing of monetary policy. Speech by Chair Powell on the economic outlook @StanfordGSB: https://t.co/y6oLUN0LYwWatch live: https://t.co/a0ApMRHum2 \u2014 Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) April 3, 2024 To Bid, or Not to Bid As the halving cycles come and go, the impact of these events could lessen in time. Since most bitcoins have already been mined, the current market liquidity state is much more about the existing supply of BTC on the market than newly mined coins. A supply crunch overnight is the least likely event, and if very recent history is any guide, geopolitical tensions can create more volatility or liquidity waves on cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. Guided by risk-on and risk-off flows, cryptocurrencies have been defying the trend occasionally, but at their core they remain a high-risk asset with a digital store of value component behind it. Only time will tell whether or not that narrative has become a well-established characteristic, but so far, so good. As the halving event comes and passes us by, it is the central banks that will have the ball in their court - ready to do whatever it takes to address inflationary challenges or supply more fiat liquidity to the monetary system.

This seemingly innocuous service, allowing employees to access a portion of their already-earned wages before payday, has ignited a firestorm in the payments industry, pitting Democrats against Republicans and revealing a fundamental disagreement about financial empowerment versus predatory lending. On one side, a chorus of Republican lawmakers sings the praises of EWA, painting it as a beacon of financial freedom for cash-strapped workers. They envision a world where a leaky pipe or a car repair doesn't force someone into the clutches of a payday loan with its exorbitant interest rates. EWA, they argue, empowers individuals by giving them control over their finances, allowing them to bridge the gap between paychecks without resorting to usurious lenders. However, Democrats see a wolf in sheep's clothing. They argue that EWA, with its potential for hidden fees and unclear disclosures, can morph into a debt trap disguised as convenience. They point to California's stricter regulations as a model, highlighting the need for clear annual percentage rate (APR) disclosures to ensure consumers understand the true cost of accessing their own money. This debate exposes a raw nerve in the American financial system: the lack of access to affordable credit for low- and middle-income earners. Stuck between the rock of infrequent paychecks and the hard place of sky-high interest rates, many workers find themselves in a vicious cycle of debt. EWA, with its promise of immediate access to earned wages, emerges as a potential solution, but the question remains \u2013 is it a genuine lifeline or just another layer of financial quicksand? The battle lines drawn in the EWA debate echo a larger war being waged in the payments industry \u2013 the fight between traditional credit, the burgeoning realm of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), and the desperate need for financial inclusion for the underbanked. Traditional credit cards offer flexibility but can trap users in a cycle of high-interest debt if not managed responsibly. BNPL, with its focus on smaller, split payments, appears to offer a more manageable alternative. However, concerns linger about the potential for overspending and a lack of the same consumer protections as traditional credit cards. EWA sits at a curious intersection of these two worlds. Like BNPL, it provides immediate access to funds, but with the potential for hidden fees and a reliance on already earned, but not yet received, income. The question then becomes: Is EWA a responsible innovation or a cleverly disguised form of predatory lending? The answer likely lies somewhere in between. EWA has the potential to be a valuable tool, particularly for those struggling to make ends meet between paychecks. However, responsible regulation and clear fee structures are crucial to prevent it from morphing into a financial burden. Here's where lessons can be learned from the ongoing evolution of BNPL. Regulatory frameworks that ensure transparency in fees and responsible lending practices are essential to protect vulnerable consumers. The fight for financial stability is a complex one, with no single solution. EWA may not be the silver bullet, but it can be a valuable tool in the arsenal for those struggling to make ends meet. However, its success hinges on responsible regulation, clear consumer protections, and a commitment to financial education. Only then can EWA truly be a champion in the fight for financial well-being, not another challenger pushing people to the edge. The battle over EWA isn't a zero-sum game. The victor shouldn't be a single political party or a profit-driven industry.

The digital age demands a more agile ruler, one that thrives in the realm of ones and zeroes. Enter Fast Payment Systems (FPS), the fintech upstarts poised to dethrone cash and usher in a new era of frictionless finance. FPS boast a simple yet revolutionary proposition: instant transfers between bank accounts, 24/7, 365 days a year. No more waiting days for checks to clear or scrambling to find an ATM on a Sunday afternoon. This streamlined efficiency has the potential to reshape our financial interactions, impacting everything from how we split a restaurant bill with friends to how small businesses manage their cash flow. But the true power of FPS lies in their democratizing potential. Unlike traditional banking systems, which can often exclude unbanked or underbanked populations, FPS can operate entirely on mobile phones. This opens the door for millions who have been locked out of the formal financial system to participate in the digital economy. Imagine a street vendor in a developing nation, previously limited to cash transactions, now able to accept instant payments via their smartphone. The implications for financial inclusion are vast. However, the road to becoming the king of the financial jungle isn't paved with good intentions alone. There are challenges FPS must overcome before they can truly claim the crown. One major hurdle is interoperability. Currently, many FPS function in silos, unable to seamlessly connect with systems in other countries. This fragmentation creates a fractured experience for users, hindering the potential for global e-commerce and cross-border transactions. Imagine a freelancer in Argentina struggling to receive payment from a client in Singapore because their respective FPS systems don't speak the same digital language. Until a level of international cooperation fosters interoperability, the true potential of FPS will remain unrealized. Security is another concern. The lightning-fast nature of FPS transactions necessitates robust security measures to prevent fraud and cyberattacks. After all, a system designed for instant transfers becomes equally adept at facilitating instant theft. Balancing speed with security will be a crucial tightrope walk for FPS providers. There's also the question of who gets to build and control these systems. Should the power lie with governments, seeking to promote financial inclusion and stability? Or should private companies take the lead, leveraging their expertise in innovation and efficiency? The answer likely lies somewhere in between, with a public-private partnership model fostering collaboration while ensuring responsible governance. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind FPS is undeniable.

Gold-i Celebrates James' Tenure \"Today, we bid sad farewell to Chris James, who joined Gold-i 12 years ago as a tester and rapidly rose to the position of CTO. Chris was responsible for many innovations during his tenure with us, and we will miss his immense intelligence and dedication,\" Tom Higgins, the CEO of Gold-i, mentioned. \"On behalf of Gold-i, we thank Chris for all his hard work and wish him the best of luck in his next career adventure. We have no doubt that he will continue to be amazing in all his future endeavors.\" James has worked for Gold-i for almost 11 years in various roles since joining as a Quality Assurance Analyst. Prior to being promoted to the role of CTO, he served as the Product Development Manager. He also held the roles of Senior Quality Assurance Analyst and Head of Quality Assurance. Expansion Strategy Last year, the UK-based firm strengthened its presence in Cyprus by appointing DL Consulting, a consultancy firm in Cyprus' financial technology sector. This partnership aims to expand Gold-i's presence in the Mediterranean island by facilitating dedicated sales and support services through DL Consulting. Given Cyprus' status as a hub for numerous forex brokers and related entities, the decision to onboard DL Consulting underscored Gold-i's approach to expanding its services in the region. Recently, Gold-i introduced a new tool to enable brokers to offer trading accounts without interest payments, Finance Magnates reported. Dubbed the Swap Free plug-in, the offering functions by halting the generation of swaps on open positions within MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5). Instead, brokers can opt to charge a commission, thus creating a new revenue stream. Additionally, the new feature gives brokers control over their fee structures.

With native USDt on TON, the network enhances Tether\u2019s use case by enabling a simple, borderless experience for peer-to-peer payments in the Telegram Messenger ecosystem, which has grown to more than 900 million users globally. USDt is already the world's most widely-used stablecoin with a market cap of more than 107 billion dollars, supported on dozens of leading blockchains, and its launch on TON network, which is tightly integrated with the Telegram Wallet, will pave the way for further expansion of Telegram\u2019s Apps and decentralized services on TON.

The EXANTE trademark is owned by XNT LTD., which has granted the use of the brand to several regulated investment firms worldwide. Available on desktop, web, and mobile, the EXANTE trading platform is ideal for experienced investors and its clients include private investors, wealth managers, and banks. In this EXANTE review, we look at the features of the trading platform and how the investment firms operating under the EXANTE brand handle sanctions. About EXANTE Owned by XNT LTD., the EXANTE brand is used by investment firms, individually licensed in Malta, Cyprus, Hong Kong, and the UK. Serving clients in over 100 countries, the EXANTE trading platform offers financial instruments including stocks and ETFs, bonds, options, and currencies. The EXANTE trading platform is ideal for advanced traders and offers a range of features including advanced reporting capabilities and multi-account trading. Trading Platform The EXANTE trading platform is available to users on desktop, web, and mobile platforms. The web platform has a modern interface with a focus on functionality. It allows for various advanced order types, with efficient search functions to find instruments quickly. The web version is ideal for traders who are looking for an advanced trading platform without the need for software downloads. The mobile trading app is designed for modern traders who are looking for a seamless trading experience on a smaller screen. The app, available on Android and iOS, implements industry-standard security features, including biometric authentication like fingerprint recognition, based on the device\u2019s capabilities. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a further layer of security. The desktop trading platform offers a powerful platform for experienced traders. Similar to the mobile app, the desktop trading platform implements strong security features including advanced encryption to protect data transmissions and client information. The desktop environment is highly functional and allows for plenty of customization thanks to its modular design. It offers a powerful search function to find instruments quickly - with a responsive search bar that includes parameters such as exchange, region, or asset class. This allows for a powerful tool to efficiently locate trading opportunities. There is a wide range of order types available, including conditional orders, allowing for a complex trading environment. The platform has a robust order management system and allows for real-time monitoring of order statuses and fast adjustments. EXANTE and sanction management The investment firms operating under the EXANTE brand keep up to date with local and international sanctions regulations to ensure compliance at all times. They utilize advanced technology to monitor transactions that could potentially violate the US OFAC, UK, UN, and EU Sanctions Regimes. EXANTE is a global trading platform that operates in compliance with international sanctions. In addition to this, the EXANTE trading platform does not accept clients from any sanctioned country or region, and it fully respects all sanction lists. The investment firms offering the EXANTE trading platform to their clients maintain a cooperative relationship with regulators and promptly apply any new sanction lists issued by relevant authorities. Regulatory compliance The investment firms operating under the EXANTE brand are regulated by several authoritative bodies, including MFSA (Malta), the FCA (UK), SFC (Hong Kong), and CySEC (Cyprus). The firms also comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). These regulations ensure that the EXANTE platform operates according to strict ethical and financial standards, allowing traders peace of mind about the safeguarding of their investments. The investment firms also take other measures to safeguard against illegal activities, including: Know-Your-Customer (KYC): Understanding the origin of clients\u2019 funds and their financial activities, with a strong focus on client relationships. Suspicious activity reporting: Following established processes for reporting suspicious transactions and activities, including reporting to a Money Laundering Reporting Compliance Officer (MLRO). Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Verifying customer identities with independent, trustworthy sources. Authentication: Requiring authorization from a designated decision-maker before doing business with politically exposed persons (PEPs). Customer safeguards In addition to a high level of compliance, EXANTE complies with MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive). In line with these requirements, client assets are held separately from company assets, by trusted custodians (respected European banks and other financial institutions). EXANTE works with major European banks and relies on Tier 1 liquidity providers for clearing. It has multiple counterparties for each financial instrument and for commodities trading, deals are executed directly at the corresponding exchanges. Conclusion The EXANTE trading platform offers direct market access and a wide range of trading instruments, with transparent rates and reliable client support. Although there are minimal drawbacks - like a high minimum deposit for individual professional traders, EXANTE is an excellent option for experienced traders who are looking for a trading platform with advanced features.

A highly customisable, beginner-friendly trading environment, OctaTrader is a dynamically evolving product based on the principle \u2018trading made clear\u2019 that Octa has been implementing since its foundation in 2011. With a wide scope of new features already implemented and still more on the way, OctaTarder will cover the key growing points, including cross-platform integration and comprehensive support in decision-making. Rooted in Octa's successful track record in the financial brokerage industry, the new OctaTrader offers a seamless financial market journey, enabling traders with different levels of experience to trade, learn, and access analytical tools within a flexible and intuitive interface. The revamped Octa ecosystem will become a key differentiator for the global broker, along with its international recognition, tight spreads, and a wide range of tradable assets available to clients. The new platform features Space, a powerful analytical hub with educational and social networking capacity to support seasoned and emerging traders every step of the way, from education to fundamental market analysis. Along with other ecosystem elements, Space is rapidly expanding and continuously improving to cover all clients\u2019 needs. For now, Space is available in English, but more languages are on the way. With Space, traders will be able to connect, collaborate, and stay up-to-date with the most relevant market trends and developments. By adjusting the analytics feed according to their trading style and preferences, Space provides the clients of OctaTrader with invaluable guidance, which is instrumental in keeping up with volatile markets and being one step ahead of the field. To support the promotion of the revamped OctaTrader, Octa has launched The lucky ones, a global communication campaign across all channels focused on traders' behaviour patterns. With this campaign, Octa aims to bring the limelight on what traders think about luck and what they do to keep it on their side during their trading sessions. This initiative includes a global survey that will explore the psychology of trading and help Octa research traders' habits, rituals, and beliefs to encompass this often neglected side of their experience within the broker's client-centred approach to financial services.

In the world of cryptocurrency, there's a spectacle that trumps them all: the Bitcoin halving. It's not just any old event in the crypto calendar\u2014it's the grand fiesta where fortunes can flip and the stakes are sky-high. And it's happening tomorrow. What\u2019s the Big Deal? Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious architect behind Bitcoin, didn\u2019t just create a currency; he scripted a drama that unfolds every four years, pulling in viewers from across the globe. Every 210,000 blocks, Bitcoin undergoes what\u2019s known as a \"halving,\" where the reward for mining new blocks is slashed by half. Sounds simple, right? But here\u2019s the kicker: this little tweak is more than just an adjustment. It\u2019s a turbo booster that historically sends Bitcoin\u2019s price on a wild rollercoaster ride, much to the delight (or dismay) of crypto enthusiasts everywhere. It's a marvel of economic engineering that turns the law of supply and demand into a spectator sport. If you\u2019re looking for a detailed look into halving, take a look at the pieces here and here. Hype, Hype, Hooray! The hype surrounding the Bitcoin halving is always something to watch. Every time a halving approaches, crypto forums light up, Twitter explodes with predictions, and every crypto trader\u2014from the bedroom enthusiast to the Wall Street whale\u2014seems to have an opinion. This isn't just market dynamics at play; it's a full-blown cultural phenomenon. The halving doesn't just affect prices; it captivates imaginations and sparks debates, making \"bitcoin halving\" a sizzling hot keyword that SEO dreams are made of. Past the Popcorn, Please The past performances of Bitcoin post-halving are like blockbuster movie openings. After the 2016 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared from $640 to a whopping $20,000 by the end of 2017. Fast forward to 2020, and the story repeated with the price peaking near $64,000 in April 2021. Sure, the price seesaws are drastic, but isn\u2019t that part of the fun? The halving brings with it the suspense of a thriller and the potential profits of a high-stakes gamble. Parties, Predictions and More In line with all the financial hype, enthusiasts around the world are getting a little \u2026 excited? Out of their minds? However you see it, there are more than a few special events planned, indeed some have already taken place! Here are but a few.

The Birth of a Legend Fun and games aside, Satoshi wasn\u2019t just coding a cryptocurrency; he was crafting a legend. By setting the Bitcoin halving every four years, he tied the digital gold rush to a rhythm that builds anticipation, stirs discussions, and, yes, encourages a bit of frenzy. This orchestrated rarity makes each halving a headline-worthy saga that pulls more spectators into the Bitcoin arena. It's not just about economics; it's about creating a story that everyone wants to be part of. In the grand scheme of things, Bitcoin halvings are more than just technical recalibrations. They are celebrations, spectacles designed by Satoshi to keep the world watching and guessing. Whether you're in it for the long haul or here for the quick thrill, one thing's for sure: The Bitcoin halving doesn't disappoint. So, buckle up, tune in, and enjoy the ride. The next chapter in Bitcoin\u2019s saga is about to begin, and it promises to be as explosive as ever. After all, in the world of Bitcoin, drama is guaranteed.

David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, has been addressing some misconceptions and speculations about himself. Recently, he was questioned about his billionaire status and wealth over NBA game seats. Due to this, the crypto community is now wondering about Schwartz\u2019s relevance and loyalty for Ripple. The Loyalty Questions About David People are questioning who David Schwartz is loyal to. After clearing up the misconception about his wealth, Schwartz received more speculative comments and criticism over his position at Ripple Labs and his loyalty. A user claimed that they are solely an employee of Ripple Labs and their loyalty lies with Ripple rather than the XRPL or XRP. Schwartz responded to this post and explained to whom he is loyal and why. Schwartz explained that Ripple\u2019s co-founder Chris Larsen had asked him to join the board, considering him loyal. At the time, Schwartz interpreted Larsen\u2019s statement to mean that he was loyal to the former CEO. Schwartz replied that he \u201cwould be loyal to him so long as I felt he was the right guy to run Ripple\u201d and pledged to be loyal to his employer. Loyalty Must Be Earned Schwartz believes that loyalty must be earned and that he is loyal to those who he thinks deserve it. This belief extends to his personal life, where he prefers not to have people\u2019s loyalty if they don\u2019t believe he deserves it. He believes that even his harshest critics would admit to this. While Ripple\u2019s CTO believes that the project still deserves his loyalty, he assures that he would stop working for them if it didn\u2019t. He might not publicly condemn them out of self-interest. However, some criticized his reply for not mentioning XRP Ledger, which they deemed to prove the original post\u2019s point. The Comment Sections Boomed The individual who first inquired about him also stated that Schwartz holds a similar relationship to Ripple as Steve Wozniak did with Apple and Steve Jobs. This comment sparked a discussion in the replies, with other community members disagreeing. One user stated that Ripple\u2019s CTO is \u201ca lot more than that\u201d and highlighted his contributions to developing blockchain technology and XRP Ledger. Another said that it was an utter misunderstanding of a great man\u2019s life\u2019s work. Schwartz also addressed the speculation of why he needs Ripple if he is the grand architect of blockchain. He affirmed that he\u2019ll stop working at the company when it\u2019s no longer fun. He also mentioned that being the boss requires dealing with a project\u2019s corporate and administrative duties, which might not suit everyone. Conclusion David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple, faced questions over his billionaire status and wealth related to NBA game seats. The crypto community is now questioning his relevance at Ripple and where his loyalty lies. This has sparked a discussion among community members about his position at the company.

Is Exodus Wallet Centralized Or Decentralized? Exodus Wallet is decentralized, giving clients ultimate control over their cryptocurrency and private keys.

Its intuitive interface, built-in trade, and staking guide make it a compelling choice for novices and skilled users. However, restricted customer service and reliance on personal practices for protection require careful consideration.

This feat not only shatters previous records but also shows the impact that gaming can have in educating a wider audience about cryptocurrency. In an interview at Token2049, Plotvinov, the creator of Open Builders, the group that created Notcoin, provided insights into the game\u2019s explosive growth. He revealed that the first objective was to foster widespread adoption of Telegram messaging software. Additionally, the goal was to integrate the advanced technology of the TON blockchain to establish a connection between the messaging service and the world of Bitcoin. The Key To Success: Simplifying Onboarding & Fostering Community According to Plotvinov, the team spent years studying Telegram\u2019s user base and the TON blockchain, which had \u201calmost zero action but had outstanding technology.\u201d After careful consideration, they decided to simplify the initial onboarding process, removing roadblocks and providing users with a compelling incentive to engage with Web3. \u201cAt some point, you just come to the idea. All right. So we just need to remove all the roadblocks in the beginning. Then, we need to give users something so they are motivated to go for all this Web3,\u201d Plotvinov explained. Its social and competitive elements further fueled the game\u2019s success, including interactions, leaderboards, and squad competitions. Plotvinov emphasized the importance of these features, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important for such a game. And within Telegram, it\u2019s effortless to onboard users and invite users.\u201d A Viral Phenomenon Without A Marketing Budget Remarkably, the Notcoin project achieved its viral status without relying on a dedicated marketing budget. Plotvinov revealed that 94% of Notcoin users came through referrals, with people inviting their friends and communities to join the game. \u201cPeople invited other people. We call them friends. You have friends; you just invite them, and you play together. You can see how they\u2019re progressing,\u201d he added. The Reverse Approach: No Need To Convince Users Plotvinov also highlighted the team\u2019s unconventional approach, which involved reversing the common practice of trying to convince users of a project\u2019s value. Instead, they embraced the idea of presenting Notcoin as \u201cprobably nothing,\u201d allowing users to discover the game\u2019s appeal organically without external persuasion. With over 30 million users onboarded and 53,000 communities competing to climb to the highest league, Notcoin has become a social phenomenon. It demonstrates the power of gaming in introducing crypto to the masses. Conclusion The incredible success story of Notcoin is proof of the ability of gaming to propel cryptocurrency acceptance among the general public. The game has engaged millions of players without conventional marketing strategies through a reverse methodology, community building, and a streamlined onboarding procedure.

This historic decision could significantly impact the video game industry. The creator of this AAA Web3 game publisher, Loren Roosendaal, is situated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As one of the first play-to-own publishers in history, he hopes to reinvent the game industry and raise Web3 gaming to Triple-A status. A Vision Backed by Hollywood & Gaming Legends Roosendaal has gathered a group of well-known professionals from the video game and film sectors to support his audacious plan. Co-founder Mark Meyers, a crucial character who brings invaluable knowledge and expertise to the table as the former Head of Disney\u2019s AAA Studios, is one of the essential figures. Planet Quest: A Pioneering Web3 Gaming Experience Planet Quest, an ambitious project in development since 2022 that has already attracted a sizable and committed fandom, is the first manifestation of the Galactic Group\u2019s ambition. Over 300,000 linked wallets are reportedly owned by holders of Planet Quest passports, more than 200,000 of which include one or more Planet Quest NFTs. The team behind Planet Quest benefits from the extensive background of former workers at Activision-Blizzard, Epic, Disney, and Warner Bros., among other industry titans. Their combined credentials include various properties, from blockbuster hits like The Batman, Avengers, and Blade Runner to AAA titles like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor. Community-Driven Co-Creation: A Revolutionary Approach What sets Planet Quest apart is its unique approach to community involvement. Over 250,000 fans have actively co-created the storyline and lore of this Star Wars-esque franchise, culminating in an accompanying trilogy of books, comics, and another game to be revealed later, according to a report from VentureBeat. This collaborative process has resulted in a genuine and invested community rewarded with in-game assets for its engagement and passion. Chief Creative Officer Jon McCoy commented, \u201cNaturally, no first attempt at something new is perfect, but it\u2019s been amazing to create a sci-fi universe with the fans in a way that\u2019s never been attempted.\u201d The Play-to-Own Revolution At the core of Galactic Group\u2019s vision lies the play-to-own model, which leverages blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to provide users with full ownership of in-game assets, such as characters, items, or land. Co-founder Mark Meyers attributed the success of this model to the community built around the project, stating, \u201cInvolving the community early on and rewarding them for their participation with in-game goods that they own benefits publishers, developers, and players by reducing publisher ad spend, providing the feedback developers need and getting the players better games.\u201d Addressing The Limitations Of The Free-to-Play Model Roosendaal believes that the dominant free-to-play model in the gaming industry is starting to show signs of cracking. Publishers spend tens of billions of dollars on advertising to acquire new players, driving up costs that are ultimately passed on to players through increasingly expensive in-game purchases. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that players are spending over $100 billion and 100\u2019s of hours of their spare time each year, gathering in-game items they don\u2019t own,\u201d Roosendaal stated, highlighting the need for a more equitable and consumer-friendly approach. A Transactional Relationship Unlike the often one-sided setup of free-to-play games, the play-to-own model aims to create a fair relationship between publishers and players. Galactic Group wants players to own their in-game assets, empowering them to have a say in the game\u2019s direction and ensuring their investments are honored. Conclusion With the introduction of Planet Quest and the establishment of Galactic Entertainment Publishing, Galactic Group is ready to bring in a new era of Web3 gaming. This bold effort aims to transform the gaming sector and push player involvement, ownership, and immersion to all-time highs through innovative blockchain technology, top-notch talent, and a community-focused mindset. The gaming community may see a significant change as the play-to-own model becomes more popular, shifting the power dynamics in favor of a more rewarding and equal experience for all parties involved.","article_summary":"Galactic Group, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, has announced the opening of Galactic Entertainment Publishing, the company\u2019s first subsidiary.

Haun has been a board member of Coinbase for the past seven years and has played a crucial role in the company\u2019s growth and success. In a post on X, Haun expressed her confidence in Coinbase\u2019s future prospects, stating that the company is well-positioned to continue thriving in the evolving crypto landscape. However, she also acknowledged the remarkable expansion of the cryptocurrency industry and revealed her intention to focus more on venture investing through her company, Haun Ventures. \u201cHaun Ventures is similarly expanding, and this feels like the right time for me to double-down on supporting our growing portfolio of founders and building a lasting venture franchise.\u201d Haun\u2019s Departure Garners Community Attention Haun\u2019s departure has garnered recognition and appreciation from the crypto community. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, lauded Haun as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who took a chance on Coinbase and played a pivotal role in the company\u2019s journey to becoming a publicly traded entity. \u201cBeing a former DOJ prosecutor, my favorite part was her counsel on regulatory strategy, and when to compromise vs go to court, which as you can imagine came in handy,\u201d Armstrong wrote.

The board anticipates a reduction in its overall size, shrinking to seven members following Haun\u2019s departure. The change also marks the loss of one of the two women currently serving as board directors, underlining the ongoing need for greater diversity and representation within the cryptocurrency industry. KBW Increases Coinbase Price Target to $230 Earlier this month, investment banking firm KBW hailed Coinbase for offering investors a unique opportunity to tap into the long-term growth potential of the crypto economy and increased its price target for COIN to $230. In a research analysis, KBW raised its Coinbase price target from $160 to $230 while maintaining its market performance rating. Meanwhile, Coinbase has also faced its fair share of regulatory trouble. Last month, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase can proceed. The Judge\u2019s decision came after Coinbase filed a motion to dismiss the SEC case, which borders on allegations the exchange operates as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. In her ruling, Judge Failla declared that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase held \u201cplausible\u201d ground. \u201cThe Court finds the SEC has sufficiently pleaded that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and through its Staking Program engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,\u201d the court document read. She granted a partial victory to the exchange against the regulator, however, dismissing the SEC\u2019s claims against Coinbase\u2019s Wallet.

This 5% increase over the last day has propelled Solana\u2018s market capitalization to approximately $67.62 billion, cementing its position as the fifth largest by market cap. As market watchers closely monitor these developments, Solana price predictions become increasingly optimistic, let\u2019s take a look at Solana\u2019s technical outlook. Solana Price Prediction Solana\u2019s pivot point set at $147.20 with an immediate resistance at $164.56, with further hurdles at $185.94 and $204.26. Should the momentum continue, crossing these barriers could indicate a stronger bullish trend for Solana. Conversely, support levels are identified at $126.23, followed by $110.96 and $92.64. These levels could provide significant bounce-back points if downward pressures emerge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 39, suggesting that Solana is nearing oversold conditions, which may prompt buying interest if it dips further. Solana Price Prediction Additionally, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $156.28 presents a potential resistance level. The EMA\u2019s proximity to the current price implies that Solana is testing significant technical thresholds. In conclusion, while the current outlook for Solana is bullish above the $147.20 pivot, a drop below this mark could trigger a sharper sell-off. Investors and traders will be watching these levels closely, as a breakout could lead to further gains, while failure to hold could see Solana retreating to lower support zones. The key will be whether Solana can sustain its upward momentum amidst the broader market conditions and overcome the resistance posed by the 50-day EMA.

The event cuts the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins, underpinning Bitcoin\u2019s strategy to cap its total supply at 21 million coins. While the halving aims to increase scarcity and potentially boost prices, the immediate market reaction has been subdued, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $64,000. Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze Shakes Up the Market The fourth Bitcoin halving took place late Friday at block height 840,000, marking a pivotal change in the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply dynamics. This event, occurring approximately every four years, reduces the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins. Such reductions are part of a predefined strategy to limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million, enhancing its scarcity by halving the influx of new coins into circulation. The Bitcoin network completes the fourth-ever \u2018halving\u2019 of rewards to miners https://t.co/2ZoDt4k69b \u2014 CNBC (@CNBC) April 20, 2024 Despite the potential for a supply squeeze to elevate prices, the immediate market reaction was understated, with Bitcoin\u2019s price stabilizing around $64,000. This muted response might stem from the halving already being factored into the price, reflecting a more sophisticated market understanding compared to earlier halvings. The halving reduces the mining reward, thus tightening Bitcoin\u2019s supply. Immediate market reaction has been calm, possibly due to pre-event pricing adjustments. Long-term effects remain uncertain, although historical trends suggest possible price increases. While it is too soon to determine the long-term impact of this halving, historical trends have shown significant price rallies following such events. However, whether this pattern will repeat remains to be seen, as each halving unfolds under unique market conditions. Bitcoin Halving 2024: Miner Rewards Cut Sparks Surge in Mining Stocks The Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024, significantly altered the compensation landscape for Bitcoin miners by slashing the block reward from 6 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This pivotal event, which occurs roughly every four years, drastically impacts the economic viability of mining activities. Leading up to the halving, anticipation fueled a rise in the stock prices of major Bitcoin mining firms, reflecting investor speculation about which companies would adapt best to the new reward structure. Notable firms like Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw their stock prices increase by over 10%, with similar gains observed in other prominent companies such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Clean Spark (CLSK). Bitcoin in half, directly affecting profitability. Impact on stock prices: Mining firms on the Nasdaq experienced substantial stock price increases due to pre-halving speculation. Operational adjustments: Mining companies are compelled to refine their strategies, often by expanding operations to mitigate the impact of reduced rewards. Post-halving, mining operations must enhance their efficiency and possibly seek additional capital to stay competitive. Historical trends suggest that although total miner revenue typically drops shortly after a halving, it tends to recover over the year as Bitcoin\u2019s price potentially increases and larger mining operations expand. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC/USD) \u2018s immediate resistance lies at $67,329, with further barriers at $69,232 and $71,425, which could cap potential gains. Conversely, Bitcoin finds immediate support at $63,045, with additional lower thresholds at $61,387 and $59,686 that could offer a fallback in case of declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51, indicating a neutral market sentiment. Bitcoin Price Prediction Notably, a downward trendline near the pivot point of $65,214 suggests resistance; thus, remaining below this mark could maintain bearish pressures. However, a breach above this level could shift momentum favorably for Bitcoin, pointing towards a more bullish stance.

The accurate determination of cost basis (initial value or purchase price) for digital asset transfers will require information sharing among brokers, which currently lacks an established mechanism. Furthermore, distinguishing between self-transfers and taxable transfers when a crypto owner moves assets between exchanges remains a challenge. Taxpayers who previously underreported their crypto income may face scrutiny when reporting their taxes in 2025. While users of foreign exchanges that do not formally serve U.S. citizens may not submit the form, the IRS can potentially detect offshore activity if assets are subsequently transferred to a U.S. exchange. The draft form is currently open for public comments, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback and suggestions before its finalization. Countries around the world are increasingly recognizing the need to tax cryptocurrency holdings as the digital currency market expands. Brazil, for instance, has introduced legislation effective from January 1, 2024, imposing a tax of up to 15% on profits from cryptocurrencies held overseas by Brazilian nationals. Meanwhile, India continues to enforce stiff taxes on crypto transactions, maintaining a 30% tax on profits and a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on all transactions. Likewise, the UK national taxing authority asked crypto users last year to disclose any unpaid taxes they might have in order to avoid fines.

According to court filings made on April 19, the plaintiffs, who had sued FTX influencers in 2022, have decided to pursue their case against FTX promoters using information presented during Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial, rather than continuing to pursue judgment against him. The filing states that Bankman-Fried possesses knowledge and information that the plaintiffs and their counsel believe will be valuable in their cases against other defendants in the FTX multidistrict litigation. This information relates to the underlying actions, the connection to the company\u2019s U.S. headquarters in Miami, Florida, and the involvement of other defendants in various states where jurisdiction is asserted. Plaintiffs to Target FTX Influencers If approved by the court, the settlement would resolve the lawsuit between Bankman-Fried and the crypto users seeking compensation for losses incurred during the collapse of FTX. The proposal suggests that the plaintiffs offered Bankman-Fried the opportunity to assist in prosecuting FTX influencers and aiding victim recovery by providing documents and testimony from his criminal trial. Notably, the information could shed light on the involvement of celebrities and companies such as Naomi Osaka, Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who endorsed the crypto exchange before its downfall. The lawsuit was initially filed in November 2022, shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, and was consolidated into its current form in June 2023. The Moskowitz Law Firm, known for handling crypto-based class-action lawsuits, represents the plaintiffs in this case. Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team filed a notice to appeal his conviction and sentence on April 11. They have also requested that Bankman-Fried remain at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, rather than being transferred to a federal prison in the San Francisco Bay Area, to assist in his defense. SBF Appeals Fraud Conviction and Sentence Last week, Bankman-Fried filed to appeal his conviction and sentence for fraud and conspiracy charges. The disgraced crypto boss was convicted last November after a month-long trial on seven different charges and was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. In an additional court filing, attorneys for the FTX founder requested that Judge Lewis A. Kaplan keep Bankman-Fried at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to \u201cfacilitate access to his appellate counsel\u201d as he works to overturn his sentence. During his sentencing, lawyers for Bankman-Fried called the Metropolitan Detention Center \u201cthe worst federal jail in the country,\u201d with prisoners having experienced issues such as lack of access to water and poor electricity. As reported, the FTX bankruptcy estate has outlined its target to initiate repayments to customers by the end of 2024, as disclosed during a meeting of FTX Digital\u2019s Joint Official Liquidators in the Bahamas. The FTX bankruptcy consists of two distinct processes, including the Chapter 11 bankruptcy being overseen by a Delaware court in the United States and the official liquidation of FTX Digital, the Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX. However, both entities have agreed to collaborate, allowing creditors to submit their claims to either party while ensuring that no creditor receives less than their entitled value.

Glassnode Report","author":"Andrew Throuvalas","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin\u2019s latest price dip to under $60,000 has raised questions as to whether the asset\u2019s spectacular bull run this year could be ending earlier than expected. Lead Glassnode analyst James Check, however, says bull have very little to worry about. Bitcoin\u2019s Pullback: Dip Or Doom? In a video analysis posted on Friday, Check reviewed various on-chain metrics concerning short-term Bitcoin holders, who first acquired their coins less than five months prior. Firstly, Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holder MVRV ratio is now re-approaching 1.0, meaning its unrealized profit and loss have reached a break-even point. This level can serve as support after a bull market dip, but also major resistance during bear markets when most Bitcoin holders are underwater. \u201cLittle undercuts are good,\u201d said Check. \u201cIn 2023 we had several of these retests. If we assume this is a resilient uptrend, we should expect the short-term holder cost basis to hold, somewhere in that $58,000 to $59,000 region. \u201c Similarly, short-term holder SOPR has also recently dipped beneath 1.0, meaning that short-term holders are now beginning to realize more losses than profits. Should SOPR fall significantly under this level without resurfacing, it may be a sign of a sustained bear market to come. As of this week, short-term holders realized losses have spiked substantially \u2013 a sign that new buyers were panic selling at a loss amid news of rising conflict between Iran and Israel. \u201cThis is essentially what you do want to see, as a contrarian,\u201d Check added. \u201cAs a contrarian, you kind of want to see people doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.\u201d Days ago, Check noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price may transition into being \u201ctop-heavy\u201d if its price moves below $58,800. The asset trades for $64,000 at writing time. Bitcoin\u2019s Long Term Momentum Other metrics like the AVIV momentum indicator suggest that Bitcoin price momentum remains positive on longer time frames, merely experiencing a cooldown on the 30-day timeframe for a \u201cproper reset.\u201d The AVIV Momentum indicator also remains in positive territory, with all timeframes hitting higher altitudes on each successive peak. A cooldown is underway on the faster 30-day indicator, which is what we want to see for a proper reset.https://t.co/hk4UJ1FZ7x pic.twitter.com/aSDhff53AM \u2014 _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) April 18, 2024 Regarding the Bitcoin halving itself, Check believes its financial impact may be overhyped. Compared to Bitcoin futures volume, spot volume, and ETF trade volume, the daily BTC issued to miners is a tiny fraction of the market. \u201cThe size of the halving, is a narrative game more than it is in terms of size now\u2026 it\u2019s just very very small,\u201d he said.

And while initiatives have been taking place to educate Americans about the traditional finance sector, opportunities around crypto education are also being presented this month. Crypto Education Becomes Important In The U.S. A recent study from Security.org found that the rate of crypto ownership in the U.S. grew by 10% last year. According to the study, 93 million people hold one or more cryptocurrencies. The upcoming Bitcoin Halving event has also sparked increasing interest in Bitcoin (BTC). Given the rising popularity of digital assets in the U.S., industry experts believe that education about cryptocurrency has become increasingly necessary. Bitcoin Educational Initiatives In The U.S. Kendra Cole, Co-founder and CEO of Sparrow Finance, told Cryptonews that the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has pushed digital assets to the mainstream. Cole believes that individuals\u2014particularly women and children\u2014must be presented with better educational opportunities regarding Bitcoin adoption. \u201cThe impetus for women to get involved in Bitcoin now is to build stronger bonds through shared experiences and interests,\u201d said Cole. \u201cWe know that women are oftentimes the chief financial officers of the home, making the majority of the financial and gifting decisions. Sparrow Finance aims to provide the tools to do this through Bitcoin education.\u201d During Financial Capability Month, Cole shared that Sparrow Finance participated in Chicago\u2019s Ultimate Baby Shower. This was a community-wide event for parents to discuss financial education. \u201cDuring this gathering, we met with new parents to provide information about how women can get involved with digital assets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also discussed ways for women to leverage Bitcoin to build connections with loved ones.\u201d Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is also focused on crypto education this month. A Coinbase spokesperson told Cryptonews that 87% of Americans want to update the financial system. \u201cThe top drivers of this discontent are frustration over fees and speed,\u201d the spokesperson noted. \u201cThe current system costs regular Americans too much, takes too long, and gets you less for your money over time.\u201d In order to shed light on this, Coinbase released a commercial this week explaining the Bitcoin halving event to the masses. \u201cThe spot will air on major U.S. channels, including TNT, ESPN, and ABC during the NBA Playoff games,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe commercial will run from April 17 through April 22.\u201d Food for thought: What if money was designed to get you more over time, not less?#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/z8eHF8JltQ \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) April 15, 2024 Coinbase believes that this advertisement sends viewers an important educational message. \u201cThis April, the rate of new Bitcoins created will be cut in half\u2014just like it has been every four years or so since it was created in 2009,\u201d the spokesperson explained. \u201cThis halving ensures its supply remains finite over time (similar to gold).\u201d Coinbase added that the company\u2019s marketing philosophy seeks to meet audiences where they are \u201cin a tech-forward way.\u201d \u201cAll of our campaigns have both online and offline components, and we invite the audience to participate,\u201d the spokesperson said. BlackRock, the San Francisco-based asset management giant with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, also recently released an educational series covering Bitcoin. A series of four short videos focused on different Bitcoin topics are available on Blackrock\u2019s official website. Bitcoin ETFs, the halving event, security, and Bitcoin adoption are all discussed in easy-to-understand language. For example, Blackrock\u2019s educational video on the Bitcoin halving notes, \u201cTo ensure no more than 21 million coins enter circulation, every four years there is what is known as a halving event, where the amount of bitcoin issued to miners for completing each block is cut in half.\u201d Crypto Education Increases Across The World While crypto education is becoming increasingly important in the U.S., a number of initiatives are being launched throughout the world as well. For example, cryptocurrency exchange Bitget recently announced that it will allocate up to $10 million to the corporate social responsibility Blockchain4Youth project. Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, told Cryptonews that the purpose of this undertaking is to support young talent while establishing a blockchain-friendly educational environment. \u201cSince the launch of Blockchain4Youth in May 2023, the program has been hosting campus roadshows around the world to educate global youth about blockchain knowledge,\u201d said Chen. \u201cThis month, Bitget hosted a Blockchain4Youth event at Ton Duc Thang University in Ho Chi Minh City as part of the HUB FORUM 2024 event, gathering over 1,000 students from various universities in Ho Chi Minh City.\u201d Chen pointed out that hosting events like Blockchain4Youth has become a necessity, noting that a recent Bitget study found that Millennials and GenZ\u2019s are likely to become the main drivers of crypto adoption. Chen added that Bitget has other educational crypto events planned in the Philippines and Japan later this month as well. \u201cCryptocurrencies have the potential to provide financial access to people who are underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems,\u201d she said. \u201cEducation can help bridge the gap by teaching people how to use cryptocurrencies and access financial services in a decentralized manner.\u201d Stablecoin issuer Tether also recently established an educational initiative in the Middle East. The USDT issuer partnered with digital asset infrastructure provider Fuze to create digital asset awareness for businesses and individuals across Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa. Tether and Fuze Forge Strategic Collaboration to Elevate Digital Asset Education in Turkey and the Middle Easthttps://t.co/QafmslCcke \u2014 Tether (@Tether_to) April 15, 2024 Tether and Fuze will develop programs and workshops to enhance awareness and understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology among local financial institutions. Crypto Education Remains Challenging While it\u2019s notable that crypto education is becoming prioritized, challenges associated with digital assets may create barriers. For instance, Cole believes that the biggest challenge involved with digital asset education is overcoming the knowledge and confidence gap. \u201cThis gap disproportionately affects women, who juggle multifaceted responsibilities \u2014like their career, family, and finances \u2014all while navigating the complexities of digital assets,\u201d she said. \u201cAmidst all of this, finding time to delve into digital asset education can seem daunting.\u201d To overcome these obstacles, Cole views the power of community and in-person events as ways to help women and families understand cryptocurrency. While this may be the case, Chen believes the crypto industry\u2019s fast-paced nature is problematic for most individuals. \u201cThe cryptocurrency industry may see new innovations emerge every month, week, or even daily,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly learners with a high level of curiosity and initiative are able to keep up with the crypto industry\u2019s pace effectively.\u201d Given this, Chen noted that individuals wanting to learn about digital assets shouldn\u2019t rely solely on articles, videos, books, or the internet to grasp the industry fully.

Per the SEC\u2019s website, Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw was sworn into her position alongside Commissioner Hester M. Peirce (aka \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d) on August 17, 2020. Both have terms that are due to expire on June 5 \u2013 less than 50 days from today. SEC Commissioner Approaches End Of Term According to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret, recent White House statements and nominations show no signs that Crenshaw or anyone else has been nominated to fill her position after her term is finished. NEW: l got lots of messages yesterday asking if the @GaryGensler resignation rumor was true. Firstly, it\u2019s an election year and there\u2019s a high possibility these could be his final few months as chairman, a position he likes, so it\u2019s unlikely he would throw in the towel early.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DBihpCeLjY \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 19, 2024 \u201cThe White House had no comment on the matter,\u201d Terret said. The revelation follows rumors earlier this week that SEC chairman Gary Gensler may soon resign after he posted a Twitter thread on Tuesday that read somewhat like a goodbye message. Several crypto-supportive congressmen, including Tom Emmer, have called on Gensler to resign for his hostile treatment of the industry and failure to adequately protect investors from its true bad actors. Under his leadership, the agency has filed dozens of enforcement actions against top crypto firms accusing them of securities law violations, while their leaders say the regulator\u2019s evaluation of the law with respect to crypto is both unclear and outdated. Terret believes the likelihood of Gensler actually resigning during an election year is slim to none, and the odds of finding a nominee to replace him are \u201cvirtually impossible.\u201d Crenshaw\u2019s Views On Bitcoin Crenshaw\u2019s potential exit could be more important for the industry. Unlike Gensler, she voted not to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs for U.S. markets in January even though the agency had already lost a court case on the matter months prior. \u201cThese Commission actions are unsound and ahistorical,\u201d Crenshaw wrote in a dissenting letter at the time. \u201cAnd worse, they put us on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.\u201d The commissioner added that spot Bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated and said the crypto spot markets are a \u201cpetri dish\u201d of fraudulent conduct. \u201cIf the technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?\u201d she added.

His analysis showed that Bitcoin prices tend to follow a repeating pattern, suggesting a bullish trajectory. Peter Brandt Bitcoin Price Prediction Entails Three Phases The seasoned trader analyzed Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior in a thread on X, where he classified the asset into three phases: Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump. Peter Brandt\u2019s chart on recurring BTC price patterns connected three phases of Bitcoin. According to the chart presented by Brandt, the current Bitcoin market has completed the first and second phases and is in the third phase. He noted that the \u201cdump\u201d part of the third stage had taken place while the \u201cpump\u201d phase was yet to materialize, suggesting a forthcoming BTC price increase. His deduction of a potential major Bitcoin price move comes amid a bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market, largely due to the news of the geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. Brandt\u2019s analysis offers a potentially deeper perspective on the recent trajectory of BTC\u2019s price, however. For instance, when Israel launched a retaliatory attack on Iran overnight, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $59K from its prior price of $63.4K before recovering to $65K. This rapid shift in trend has also fueled gains in other cryptocurrencies, indicating the possibility of an altcoin rally. BTC price dipped to $59K in the early hours of April 19. Source: CoinmarketCap. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data indicates that large Bitcoin holders (crypto whales) may have used the price dip to accumulate more cryptocurrencies at a discount. Earlier this week, Cryptonews.com reported a transfer of over 27.7K BTC ($1.75 billion) sent into accumulation wallet addresses between April 16 and April 17. This exceeded the previous record of 25,500 BTC (almost $1.6 billion) sent to such wallets on March 23, when the Bitcoin price was around $63.5K. Additionally, the impending Bitcoin halving event strengthens Brandt\u2019s Bitcoin price prediction. The halving is designed to reduce incentives for mining new blocks, thereby slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created.

The trader claimed that the current dip period of BTC, which is dubbed as the third or \u201cDump\u201d stage in Brandt\u2019s projection, might be the last opportunity for Bitcoin holders to purchase BTC at a relatively low value before post-halving sets in. In a post on X, Rekt Capital explained that recent BTC price movement features are similar to previous Bitcoin halving cycles, during which price declines gave way to rallies. #BTC 3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving 1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace Bitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a month In mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% again This\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2BKBQXpPOV \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 17, 2024 Rekt projected a \u201cre-accumulation phase\u201d for Bitcoin following the halving event scheduled for April 20, adding that this phase has a history of lasting over a year (385 days). A Reck Capital chart suggests incoming price growth for BTC. Due to current market conditions, however, Rekt Capital suggested that this phase could be shorter, leading to a potential BTC price increase sooner compared to previous cycles.

On-chain markets refer to crypto assets issued and traded directly on the blockchain. Ethereum, Solana, and BNB are the most commonly used chains by those issuing or trading on-chain tokens. These on-chain markets are highly illiquid compared to centralized spot cryptocurrency exchanges or traditional financial markets. The Halving is Coming. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/JCD677j4Md \u2014 Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 19, 2024 That makes them highly volatile. A newly launched coin can easily see gains of 100x in days as its market cap surges from the tens of thousands to millions. Equally, a small amount of sell pressure can trigger huge price drops. And that\u2019s not the only risk. There is virtually no barrier to entry for someone to issue their own token. That means scammers flock to the on-chain crypto markets to attempt to scam unaware investors. They can do this by inserting malicious code into the token\u2019s smart contract creating unfair trading conditions. Alternatively, the token might be a pump-and-dump scheme. This is where the team behind a token builds up artificial hype to create demand, cashes in, and abandons ship. One popular technique is for a token\u2019s issuer to watch the ETH in the token\u2019s liquidity pool rise as the token\u2019s price pumps, only to withdraw and make off with this ETH abruptly. That\u2019s why many on-chain investors look for \u201clocked liquidity,\u201d which prevents such rug pull attempts. All that being said, let\u2019s take a look at some of the top crypto gainers today in the on-chain markets. Top Crypto Gainers Today RunesBot (RBOT) The newly launched Ethereum token RunesBot (RBOT) is up nearly 26,000% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener. RunesBot is a telegram trading bot built to function on the soon-to-be-launched Runes ecosystem. The token\u2019s market cap was last around $1.8 million, with just over $200,000 in locked liquidity. While it looks like a legitimate project, RBOT has a few aspects that are concerning to its smart contract. Transfers are pausable and there is a 5% buy and sell tax. Traders should always exercise caution before involving themselves in the on-chain market. BitRunes (BRUNES) Another Runes protocol-linked token called BitRunes (BRUNES) is pumping hard on Friday. As per DEXScreener, it was last up 150,000% in the past 24 hours with a market cap of $9.5 million. BitRunes allows users to bridge their Ethereum funds to the Bitcoin network through the Rune Launchpad. The token last had $520,000 in locked liquidity and has seen 24-hour trading volumes of $4.5 million. Like RBOT, it looks like a legitimate project. But like RBOT, its smart contract has concerning aspects. BitRunes has a modifiable tax and transfers are pausable. Additionally, the ownership of the token hasn\u2019t yet been renounced. Alien King (ALK) A Base launched meme coin called Alien King (ALK) has pumped hard since its launch on Friday. As per DEXScreener, ALK was last up 11,500% in the past 24 hours, with its market cap reaching $1 million. I'm visiting somewhere in the earth. I will send you the secret gift if someone own ALK The King said #AlienKing #ALK #Base pic.twitter.com/Fz346lG9gL \u2014 Alien King (@AlienKi_) April 19, 2024 The token has locked liquidity of $244,000 and has seen over $13.3 million in volume so far. As per Go+ Security, the token has zero smart contract issues. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a pump and dump. Traders must always be cautious and do their own research. Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy. An innocent-looking project could easily be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower. A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales. The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price. These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing. While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales\u2014unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision\u2014savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more. With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market. Here are 19 of the presale projects with the highest potential.

Prosecutors argued that Eisenberg orchestrated a complex exploit on the platform, leading to substantial financial losses. Eisenberg, who has been in custody since January 2023, could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Eisenberg Found Guilty of Commodities Fraud and Manipulation in Mango Markets Case As reported by Reuters, On April 18, a federal jury in New York found Eisenberg guilty of commodities fraud, commodities manipulation, and wire fraud in connection with the exploit, which involved manipulating Mango Markets\u2019 native token, $MNGO.

Eisenberg was arrested in December 2022 in Puerto Rico. During the closing arguments on April 17, Eisenberg\u2019s legal team contended that he had not committed any criminal acts but rather orchestrated a \u201csuccessful and legal trading strategy,\u201d resulting in approximately $110 million in gains. In contrast, prosecutors argued that Eisenberg \u201chad to lie\u201d to facilitate the withdrawal of funds from Mango Markets, suggesting fraudulent intent.

They talked about a con man. But you know that's not the case \u2014 Inner City Press (@innercitypress) April 17, 2024 Eisenberg\u2019s lawyer, Brian Klein, asserted that his client fully adhered to Mango Markets\u2019 smart contracts and withdrew his capital without borrowing. Additionally, Eisenberg returned $67 million worth of cryptocurrency to Mango Markets following the exploit, claiming he had legally obtained the remainder of the funds. Klein expressed disappointment at the verdict but affirmed their intention to continue fighting for their client. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed, but we will keep fighting for our client,\u201d he stated, indicating plans to file post-trial motions. Hacker Convicted in $110 Million Mango Markets Exploit Case On October 11, 2022, Mango Markets was the victim of an attack in which approximately $110 million was drained from its treasury. Shortly after the attack, Avraham Eisenberg came forward as the perpetrator, asserting that the exploit was merely a \u201chighly profitable trading strategy\u201d and claiming it was conducted within the bounds of legality and the protocol\u2019s intended design. According to prosecutors, Eisenberg utilized two accounts to engage in manipulative trading involving futures contracts tied to the values of Mango\u2019s token MNGO and the stablecoin USD Coin. These trades purportedly inflated the value of his contracts by 1,300% within 20 minutes, allowing him to borrow against his holdings and withdraw $110 million in various cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, Eisenberg agreed to return $67 million in exchange for other token holders refraining from pursuing legal action or freezing his assets. He was arrested on December 26, 2022, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he resided, and has remained in custody since then, deemed a flight risk by prosecutors.

The legal ramifications continued to mount for Eisenberg as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges on January 20, alleging violations of anti-fraud and market manipulation provisions of U.S. securities laws. A lawsuit filed by Mango Labs characterized Eisenberg as a \u201cnotorious online personality\u201d with a history of attacking multiple cryptocurrency platforms and manipulating cryptocurrency markets. Eisenberg\u2019s scheduled July 29 sentencing carries a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although the actual sentence is expected to be less severe. This verdict comes shortly after the sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange, to 25 years in prison for embezzling $8 billion from customers, highlighting increasing scrutiny and enforcement within the cryptocurrency industry.

BTC\u2019s issuance rate to miners will drop by 50% in just over 8 hours, as per nicehash.com. It will fall from the current 6.25 BTC tokens per block to 3.125 BTC tokens per block. This will reduce Bitcoin\u2019s annual inflation rate to around 1%. In the long run, the halving will directly reduce spot market sell pressure from miners, who constantly need to sell some of their Bitcoin stash to fund their mining operations. That all sounds very bullish, and in the past, Bitcoin halvings have preceded massive run-ups in the crypto\u2019s price.

But the Bitcoin price had never rallied to fresh record highs ahead of these prior halvings. That\u2019s not been the case this time, with Bitcoin hitting new record levels in March 2024 near $74,000. Some think the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January brought some of Bitcoin\u2019s expected post-halving rally forward. That suggests that Bitcoin may have less room to run higher this time than in the past. Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 The Best Crypto to Buy Now For New Investors? But even if Bitcoin was \u201conly\u201d able to post a 3x rally after the halving this time, that would see it reach $180,000. And the post-halving rally may have to wait a few months as these typically don\u2019t kick in for 4-6 months. That could reflect a short-term rise in miner sell pressure while they cope with a sudden drop in revenue. Also, macro headwinds have been building recently. Strong US data and hawkish Fed speak have forced traders to price out rate cut bets lately. But Bitcoin\u2019s long-term outlook still looks bullish. The halving event is great marketing for Bitcoin, reinforcing the narrative that it is \u201csound money\u201d and akin to digital gold. Additionally, the Fed will likely cut interest rates at some point. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETF demand is likely to keep acting as a tailwind. And this year\u2019s US election will probably see a pro-crypto shift in the US regulatory landscape. The odds that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 in the coming quarters is strong. For any new investor in the crypto space, Bitcoin is definitely the best crypto to buy now.

Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains. But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in crypto presales. This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development. These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors. Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.

Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to record levels near $74,000 last month. At the same time, Litecoin was only able to rally to highs just above $110 this month. That left it still down around 73% versus its December 2017 record highs at $420. But in light of the latest market dip, the Litecoin price is closer to 80% down from all-time highs. Compare that to Bitcoin, which was last down by only around 14% since last month\u2019s record peaks. BTC was last changing hands in the mid-$63,000s. To be fair to Litecoin, it\u2019s not the only major altcoin that remains a long way below record levels. Solana (SOL) is still down 45% versus its 2021 record peaks. And XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are down around 85%. Bitcoin has been able to recover back to record levels ahead of other coins given bullish narratives such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the fact that it faces a favorable regulatory environment worldwide, and the growing idea that it is \u201cdigital gold\u201d and therefore a great safe-haven asset and hedge against currency debasement. Litecoin\u2019s Narrative Problem Litecoin, by comparison, is suffering from a significant narrative problem. That is to say, while Litecoin has a lot going for it, it lacks narrative momentum. Litecoin is attempting to position itself as the \u201cdigital silver\u201d to complement Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d. Thanks to its fair launch (a Bitcoin fork) and high level of decentralization, Litecoin is one of the only cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin that global regulators widely agree is not a security, meaning it also faces a friendly regulatory environment worldwide. And its blockchain is much faster and cheaper than Bitcoin and able to bare a much higher load. Despite only ranking as the 19th largest crypto by market cap, LTC is the leader in crypto payments. https://t.co/NYpNlhtF0x \u2014 Litecoin (@litecoin) March 15, 2024 But the cryptocurrency\u2019s continued adoption as a medium of payment, its intended use case, is failing to lift its price. Indeed, on-chain data this week revealed that a record-high 62.5% of Litecoin investors now qualify as HODLers. 'On-chain data shows that Litecoin\u2019s long-term holders have achieved a new record: 62.5% of all $LTC investors now qualify as these HODLers.' \u2013 @bitcoinist https://t.co/MZVFrEHLJ2 \u2014 Litecoin (@litecoin) April 16, 2024 Litecoin Price Prediction \u2013 Can LTC Hit $1,000? Record high Litcoin HODLing suggests a lack of retail investor interest in the cryptocurrency. Broader use amongst retail and short-term investors is a key part of a cryptocurrency\u2019s adoption. And an influx of new short-term investors will be needed for the LTC price to drive higher. But the lack of participation by retail/short-term investors is a strong bottom signal for the Litecoin price. The HODLers who now dominate the LTC market are much less likely to sell their coins. The transfer of holdings from weak-handed short-term/retail investors has seemingly already taken place. The bull market in Bitcoin and many other cryptos is well underway. At some point it is likely to bleed into LTC in a more meaningful way. At such a cheap valuation below $100 and with a market cap of $6 billion, Litecoin has a strong risk-reward. Calling a more than 10x rally to $1,000 per token is a big call. Narratives surrounding Litecoin would have to gain a lot more traction. But Litecoin stands a very good chance of posting 5x gains to challenge record highs above $400. The Litecoin price stands a very good chance of posting 5x gains to challenge record highs above $400.

But some traders wish to take bigger risks for bigger potential upside. They should look no further than the meme coin market. New meme coins are popping up all the time. Most never gain traction. But those that do can post huge gains of 100x or more. One fun new meme coin that comes backed by compelling cross-chain bridging technology is Dogeverse.

Bitcoin halvings occur automatically every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. To understand the importance of this event, let\u2019s examine previous halving events and their historical impact on the industry. A Look Back at Previous Bitcoin Halving Events Bitcoin halving events have historically contributed to major Bitcoin price rallies. Bitcoin\u2019s protocol has mandated three halving events thus far, gradually decreasing the block reward for miners from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in 2012, then to 12.5 BTC in 2016, and most recently to 6.25 BTC on May 11, 2020. The 2024 halving event will see the subsidy reward for miners on the network drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. In the long term, only 21 million Bitcoins will exist. What comes after 2024\u2019s Halving Event? Bernstein predicts that Bitcoin will continue on its bullish path after the halving event and could reach $150,000 by the end of 2025. Coinify CEO Rikke Staer warned about #Bitcoin sales after halving in the @TheBlock__ interview.

While Bitcoin miners have profited this year, the extent the halving will impact less efficient mining operations has yet to be determined. Bitcoin\u2019s price is hovering around $64,500 as of writing, representing a 1.33% increase over the past 24 hours, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin\u2019s price fell below $60,000 earlier today amid reports of Israeli missiles hitting a site in Iran but has rebounded strongly since.

In his March dismissal, Sun largely argued that the federal agency was overstepping its authority in attempting to prosecute him, citing jurisdictional overreach. \u201cThe SEC is not a worldwide regulator,\u201d lawyers for Sun wrote in the March 28th dismissal. \u201cIts efforts to leverage highly attenuated contacts to the United States, to extend U.S. securities laws to cover predominantly foreign conduct, go too far and should be rejected.\u201d In addition to Sun, several notable celebrities including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, and Austin Mahone, were charged \u201cfor illegally touting TRX and/or BTT without disclosing that they were compensated for doing so.\u201d SEC Presses Forward with Crypto Crackdown The SEC\u2019s amended lawsuit against Tron arrives amidst growing criticism of its \u201cregulation-by-enforcement\u201d approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. Sun\u2019s March dismissal motion challenges the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction and asserts that neither TRX nor BTT qualify as investment contracts or securities. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has pursued lawsuits against major crypto entities like Coinbase, Ripple, and Binance, alleging violations of federal securities laws. Coinbase recently attempted to dismiss its case, arguing that the SEC\u2019s claims regarding selling unregistered securities exceed the agency\u2019s authority. However, U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled in favor of the SEC, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. And we\u2019re not done.

Broadcasting and preservation: AI\u2019s role in enhancing the Olympic legacy AI\u2019s powers influence not only the ways the athletes were previously competing but also the athletes themselves. IoT is the revolutionary marketplace where Xeon processors will break their boundaries and make a difference in exponential progress in software. This is the role of TV channels, which compress and transmit these high-resolution images of live TV with the usage of 8K/60FPS/HDR technology and make it possible to deliver them with low delay to all customers all over the world, regardless of their interest group, immediately. On the one side, it has to be an off-the-shelf case pinpointing that artificial intelligence, in this case, can be advisable and meet all the desiderata of the IOC at the same time in the end, attempting to trace back the contemporary games to their original roots. A myriad of stages of e-implementation governs the creation of such a vivid 3D virtual world, starting from methods that make entities three-dimensional, going all the way to producing these entities in a truly authentic sense. It also enabled customers to visit these tours at their most convenient time, place, and comfort. Furthermore, they will have a real-time perception of various 3D graphs and objects with full interaction when they engage in their e-learning material. The Olympics shown in the theatre may not only entail reports about the sports activities, but it may lead the youth of a country to understand the world, but this will be for a limited period. Responsible leadership and embracing change In this regard, Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, shared his view that any technological intervention in the game is too risky since it may destroy the sport\u2019s critical human element. The committee believes that although it\u2019s important, ethics discussion should still be on the agenda. \u201cFor playing all the AI stuffing it in the position of the brain of our company and becoming the omnipresent mind for all sports organizations is the vital outside inflow in the inner circulation of the IOC,\u201d said Saiki, the CEO. Employing peer performance appraisal education-related issues dealt with because a critical issue in the modern world is that people are at a high risk of obtaining different diseases, and the available resources for treatment purposes are surely not adequate when it comes to taking care of children from a family with the low education level or poor background. \u201cCheers to AI that crunches data: The second quotation comes from, and she said, \u201d Sagacity combined, these both architectural and virtual realms will be measured up, and the intelligent surrounding will automatically react remodeling the available spaces where other services may be seen in the market.\u201d The \u201cAI\u201d plan of the IOC is a peculiar approach with which humans gain a new understanding of the following games of the Olympics, to be held in Paris in 2024. Therefore, the IOC is increasingly starting to organize fairer events that would catch the attention of today\u2019s spectators but would still be enacting their primal role, that is, the Festivals if in the field of tech advancement, the way of thinking of people becomes more difficult. The fact is AI is not at all being substituted for the primary mother factors, pillars (reason), or goals of sports for the reason that helping all the sportsmen and women from different parts of the globe to join in one spirit and competition is what remains the causes of the games. Consequently, this element will play a critical role in enhancing the importance of that extraordinary phenomenon when the fans of American sports, the athletes, and the very events themselves are all known to be exceptionally supportive.

Spines has developed an all-encompassing AI publishing platform that works under the guidance of a production manager. The company also has a US office in Florida, which is currently quite active. The funding round was supervised by Aleph, which is a New York-based financial services firm, along with previous investors M-Fund, LionTree, and also Dan Senor, who is the coauthor of the bestseller Start-Up Nation. Spines founder Niv said that the traditional status quo is inefficient and the market needed an alternate tech-based solution, and that their funding round is an important step for expanding their already proven practical use cases and their widening market presence. AI Publishing platform, Spines features Spines offer extensive features for book designing and publishing, as it creates over 70 versions of the front, back, and spine to choose from. As said above, the system works under the supervision of a production manager, so an author can decide during any stage of the process if he or she wants to seek the assistance of a human expert. It is said that the Spines platform cuts down publishing costs by 30% and it also lowers the publishing time from six months to two weeks because it provides an extensive suite of services to authors. Spines also lists the book on more than one hundred channels, and it optimizes metadata automatically with the help of its AI capabilities. Once the book goes live, users are provided with additional options for distribution, marketing, and royalty management, which are managed by artificial intelligence. Increased publications in the future The current valuation of the publishing industry is around $37 billion, and it is expected to rise to $41 billion by 2027. There are usually few opportunities for self-publishing authors for monetization and marketing, as the sector\u2019s practices are still largely traditional and analog. By the end of this year, Spines is aiming to increase its publications and publish nine books per day, which will be around 3000 books in 2024, while during the last year, it published 500 books altogether. The Spines process is quite straightforward, the author is required to upload his transcript, and they will get their book optimized and published in two weeks time, and it will be accessible to readers across the globe. Aleph Partner Michael Eisenberg said that Spines is a good option for investment where they look to invest in AI. As an author, he also said, \u201cI can tell you that the current book publishing process is expensive, painful, and long.\u201d Source: Refreshmiami. According to him, Spines has the potential to make the traditional publishing sector much better by being available to more customers and by being efficient. Another investor, Lior Elkan, M-Fund Managing Partner, also showed his confidence in Spines, as, according to him, Spines founder and CEO shared an aspiring vision with them regarding the publishing sector\u2019s potential, it was before the ChatGPT launch and is often an area ignored by traditional venture capitalists.

Haun has been on the board of Coinbase for the last seven years and has significantly contributed to the company\u2019s asset and advantage-building journey. Haun\u2019s contributions to Coinbase On the X blog, Haun wrote that she strongly believed Coinbase would endure the transitioning crypto market and enjoy continuous progress inexpensively. Nevertheless, she acknowledged the rapid growth of the crypto sector and mentioned that she decided to allocate more time to her company, an investment fund firm. Haun\u2019s exit has gained admiration and a high appraisal from the community. Brian Armstrong, the CEO at Coinbase, honored Haun as she \u201cgot the vision\u201d and was a great turner, making iron stakes that held the company to become a public institution. Katie took a chance on us when we were a little known crypto exchange, back when very few people believed in the technology, and I'll always be grateful for that.

The board is considering replacing two members, which would reduce the total to seven, supported by Haun\u2019s resignation. Coinbase regulatory challenges The transition will face the elimination of one of the two women on the board of directors, which, again, is not only the lack of diversity and representation in the cryptocurrency industry but also the symptoms.

Today, this can be as an image for relevance or treatment advancements. Another way is to examine how these technologies are real tools for controlling medicine. Addressing the challenges of polypharmacy When people have reached a certain age and are on some kind of polypharmacy, one should consider that the medication for such a cause influences one\u2019s communication. On the other hand, the medication may lead to a problem in the brain\u2019s ability to send the right messages to one\u2019s body. Dangers of taking drugs in combination are possible with shared drug users as they face undesired physiological responses, which are due to complex chemical interactions. Eventually, healthcare providers become members of this process in the sense that they serve a regulatory role responsible for the deprescribing actions, such as the case of discontinuing or reducing the use of medications that already do not matter. Next to this is the authentic predicament, which has many physicians concerned, and it involves the making of a decision to either stop some drugs from the elderly patient\u2019s inpatient list or to stop the treatments that involve the use of a specific pharmaceutical. Nephrologists work with old people much of the time without the appearance of the anesthesiologist who visits all of the elders in such institutions. To plot the aging community, investigators built a role-playing setting where seniors were going through a drug regimen of several prescriptions. Reactions like the side effects of the medications and even the expulsion of their beliefs after the transformation made them sad and interfered with their normal lives into something frightening. Finally, the cardiovascular disease and the patient\u2019s physical performance were brought back to the normal range, with a solid foundation for the successful medical disposal of ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, many individuals of people, who have heart diseases got sick because they haven\u2019t one time taken kind to medicine, and now they are very ill, and that results because the AI advocates for self-medication. So, the antibiotics section focused on hysterics or sports and positively changed the strength of the heart. An existing plan delivered the treatment, and care was taken to advance or substitute other options. While the chatbot\u2019s technical profile precludes most consequences counter to the patient\u2019s normal living activities, the partial design of the patient\u2019s daily activity does not take on the conflicting action presented in this analysis. A promising step towards safer medication management Besides the listed benefits, one study has demonstrated a direct connection between chatbot use and the reduction of opioid and pain therapy drug use compared to placebo. Pill to cure blood pressure or cholesterol problems. Write down the sample sentence and then paraphrase it: Spending limited medical resources in the healthcare sector is a subtle challenge that raises moral concerns. So, the elderly alone can\u2019t bear the stresses and problems; the other partners must accompany them. People are alive; to have them remain even in the same conditions isn\u2019t useful; hence, they should be supported to live comfortably, which is a tasty fruit. Furthermore, after beta testing, some changes were made, and it was discovered that those errors were caused by changing or fluctuating data. These variations within the output were the reason for the changes; each session was unique. Concerning implementing a more effective specific technology, an almost tried-and-true method, Dr. Marc Succi emphasizes the influence of technological improvement in the production of diagnostic tests. Nevertheless, they are just getting their feet wet now because they still have an arduous way to go before they can become full-grown and realize their potential. However, their loyal reliability gives us extra evidence of their daily application on big currency exchange volumes. Perjuangan Arya Rao (prescription seniors on AI) identifies that when establishing the later generations of AI systems in health care, AI can assist significantly in the error control method through the delivery of drugs for seniors. The complexity of their issues is not going to drop only by this 40% of patients who belong to a category of polypharmacy- the biggest sector of patients requiring more attention and specialist staff working with them. This indicates that extensive testing is going on among the frontline physicians. I invite you to consider whether they may have had to deal with a patient at some point who was on a drug that had been mixed with more than one medication. The AI system should be designed so much so that anyone utilizing the system can conveniently monitor all the medication usage processes, given that the tool is not only effective but also reliable and devoid of errors. Additionally, here is the definite input into the system design, which in turn creates an opportunity to employ AI-informed therapy (also known as teletherapy) as a wide-scale substitute for traditional procedures, as more and more individuals will be capable of monitoring their medical state and utilize the proposed services. Therefore, supplements and medical equipment supplies are also bought without anyone\u2019s approval, with all the senior care homes present. In contemporary times, the elderly increasingly find themselves in the care cradle unless they have been classified into a health-concerned category that gets assistance.

Addressing Africa\u2019s challenges Souandaou Athoumani Ali, a student from Comoros and a presenter of the Platform, said the workshop seeks for a place to discuss the problems faced by Africa. Established in 2019, the Platform has played the role of a valuable data source for revealing trending topics through their plagiarism scanners and review dissertations in Turkey as per Ali\u2019s insight. Overall, one\u2019s objective is to give the newest understanding of African studies in Turkey based on international research and Afro-realist thinking. Alhaji Abdoul Fathi Sanago, the Platform\u2019s general coordinator, noted that the wide range of conversations at the workshop has been truly heartwarming. Presentations included a wide range of topics from politics to healthcare artificial intelligence and many more. The task delegation represents participants in deliberations to seek solutions for the infectious deceases and political anomie worsening Africa\u2019s economy. Inclusive participation The Platform has been put forward by Sanogo as a network that is inclusive and invites African researchers, situated in any part of the world, to actively participate without limitations. Don\u2019t forget about the partnership with non-African experts as you have stated. Firstly, the ice cream production was carried out in the Turkish language, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a connecting language for the Africans who are living in Turkey. The Platform underlined the importance of a platform that is meant to allow African thoughts to be central, and also to bring forth the solutions that are got from the Africans to be on the table. The workshop highlighted equally the goal of producing ideas that will, first, be beneficial to Africa collectively. The workshop facilitated a forum where the African students who are studying in Turkey would have a chance to present and discuss their empirical and conceptual findings. They actively participated in the interwoven discourses, delivering presentations in Turkish that contributed meaningfully to the common understanding of African academics. Such inputs aided in proving the breadth and depth of African academic writing. Empowering African voices for change At the Kwan Africa Workshop, participants have shared their optimism in the power of such initiatives in solving the challenges in Africa. The Platform will also aim to enhance the ongoing exchange and partnership even more, positioning locals as agents of change in addressing the primary African challenges. During the first Prafric workshop in Istanbul, a number of African students and scholars participated together in discussions focusing on the major problems facing Africa. The forum involved students in diverse conversations coming under the umbrella of a wide range of disciplines, such as health, international relations, and commerce, they broached problems of infectious diseases, political instability, and commercial dogmatism. The openness of the Platform as well as its observance of the African views spreads makes it all the more meaningful with regard to the exchange and collaboration between the Africans.

Worse still, the development of AI technologies has uncovered thorny issues including the perpetuation of racial bias in AI-produced content. Business insider provided some cases of the racial biases built by AI systems with these few professionals who are in technology industry as the example. Many of these biases represent a huge problem and deserve priority action. There are, however, some cases where AI isn\u2019t at its best and this could include something tragic such as the fall of Tay, an AI from Microsoft that happened in 2016. Using social networking platforms like Twitter, the designer of Tay, a bot, was able to learn unwanted language after encouraging users to engage in offensive interactions, causing the bot to be terminated just after 1 day. Even though there has been the development of the field of AI since the 1970s, the main issues associated with it have not been totally eradicated yet. This case testifies the necessity of fighting AI racial bias during designing the process. Current concerns and industry response In the latest update to an IEEE Spectrum article, Jay Wolcott, the founder of Knowbl, a generative AI Company, Brought up this crucial question of what limits AI systems must attempt to be controlled with what they decide to involve themselves. On the other hand, this issue may disclose a more serious problem when the AI-supposed perfectly designed future and the real-life story could be confronted by the side effects of AI. With the advancement of AI in many fields, in particular the question of coming up with an all-around strategy to deal with racial biases, deserves more attention. To eliminate racial discrimination in the field of Artificial Intelligence, industries should place more emphasis on diversity and inclusion during the design of AI solutions and the training of the datasets. Diverse voices can lead to the identification of one-sidedness, or the unconscious bias even within the process of building new products. As an additional point, rigorous ethical standards and governance systems are the shields that keep AI safe once they are deployed. Collaborative activities between tech companies, governmental institutions, and advocacy associations target their creation in the future of a digitally fair and equitable AI realm. Ensuring transparency and accountability Transparency in AI algorithms is the key to the effective and well-mannered implementation of AI which assists in the removal of AI algorithms biases. Organizations ought to be open about how AI systems reach their decision which should also include ways for complaints and accountability. Through systematic audits and evaluations of injustices, we can detect and challenge the biases that are re-adapted from generation to generation. These key players contribute to the establishment of the required belief and confidence in AI technology by highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability. Since the bias of race in AI opens much problems in ethical and fair use of this technology, it is the most priority issue for its further development. Although the benefit of artificial intelligence for humans is enormous, combating bias is the main task. With the idea of diversity in mind, injecting ethics into the AI environment, and promoting openness and transparency, the stakeholders can have a system that is inclusive. Collaboration of the industry accompanied by any necessary corrective measures that will eliminate racial bias and holding the principles of fairness and equality in AI are of utmost importance.

In the case of sharing, there will be more serious consequences for breaching the law, which will lead to a jail sentence. Women are often the most vulnerable, as they are mostly targeted by using their faces to create pornographic content. Public figures, mostly celebrities, are also victims of this offense, as the deepfake has become almost a mainstream trend with the advancement of technology in the recent times. According to Yvette Cooper, a shadow home secretary, that the creation of such material is outright a gross violation of a person\u2019s privacy, and the government should not be tolerated by the government. She said, \u201cTechnology is increasingly being manipulated to manufacture misogynistic content and is emboldening perpetrators of Violence Against Women and Girls,\u201d she added, \u201cIt\u2019s essential that the police and prosecutors are equipped with the training and tools required to rigorously enforce these laws in order to stop perpetrators from acting with impunity.\u201d Source: BBC. Limitations of law and hurdles in its enforcement According to experts familiar with the subject, that culprits are difficult to find because of the nature of the tech, and that the culprits may go away with their crime despite the legislation, as it is a worldwide problem and is not limited to a region. Source: Iproov. A law was passed last year that made the sharing of deepfakes illegal, but the new law will make it illegal from the very start of the process as it will prohibit the creation of any sexually explicit deepfake without permission, according to the ministry. As deepfakes can be used to distress, humiliate, or alarm the victim. Some experts are skeptical of the fact that the law will only criminalize if a person can prove that another person has created the false image, as the burden of proof lies on who alleges it, and providing proof will not be easy in this scenario. But it is also a fact that no one can be charged without proof. The new law will be applicable to images of people over 18 years of age because minors are already covered by the law. Despite the fact that how effective the law is and its enforcement, it at least gives the message that not only the distribution but also the creation of such material is also immoral and misogynistic.

The rise of Bitcoin ETFs Horsley\u2019s predictions, however, not by chance, completely match the general sentiment in the market that we may experience a surge in investing in ETFs since Bitcoin is also getting increasingly popular globally. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is buzzing with action, hustling for the top spot, which is just $2 billion far away from Grayscale\u2019s. The eventuality of this placing implies that blackrock will probably be at par and maybe at a higher level than Grayscale as the largest Bitcoin fund globally. GBTC\u2019s price dropped prominently during its last 68 days, shedding $1.6B and adding to its total assets approximately $1.94B, compared to IBIT\u2019s steady growth with assets capping at $17.3B. Contrarily, important of the capital made by Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF exits was observed. Over the last 5 working days, investors have taken out $89.9 million, contributing to boosting the net outflows to $1.6 billion from January to date. Changing market trends Even though Grayscale\u2019s in-depth adoption of BTC must be appreciated, it slowly falls behind in the competition for bitcoin ETFs. Following the sanctioned trading, Fidelity and BlackRock soon began to grow their market shares into great portions. Respectfully, Fidelity and BlackRock Bitcoin ETFs were recipients of investments of $37.3 million in $18.7 million in the same week.

This is exactly as described by Bitwise CEO concerning the adoption of Bitcoin ETFs by registered investment advisers (RIAs) and multifamily offices Per the Farside data, GBTC witnessed outflows of $17.5M on April 10, which is a highly reduced extent of the previously recorded $154.9M outflows on April 9. The day before, 26 February, was the worst day when GBTC drained $22.4 million. GBTC is a spot Bitcoin ETF that was established in 2015.

Aptos Overview MARKET CAP CIRCULATING SUPPLY ALL-TIME LOW ALL-TIME HIGH POPULARITY $5 billion 398,060,681 $3.09 $19.90 #24 Aptos Price History The Aptos blockchain was developed over the past three years by over 350+ developers across the globe. The team behind Aptos previously built the Diem blockchain, which was deployed in early 2020 to more than a dozen node operators. The mainnet of Aptos was launched in October 2022; its initial total supply of APT at mainnet was 1 billion tokens. After the initial hype, APT would fall to its lowest in December 2022 to $3.09. A month later, tables turned as it peaked at an all-time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. In January pumped likely due to the blockchain\u2019s non-fungible token market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingos have attracted more users. APT was bearish in Q1 2023. On 6th June, APT fell below its initial listing price and extended the losses in the preceding months. In October, it started correcting, rising as high as $8.47 in November. In 2024, it broke above the $10 mark, reaching a high of $18 in March. Source: https://coinstats.app/coins/aptos/ More on the Aptos Network What Is Aptos Blockchain? Aptos, an innovative layer1 blockchain, is built upon the Move programming language and can be considered the successor to Meta\u2019s now-defunct Diem blockchain project. Centered on scalability, reliability, safety, and upgradeability, Aptos aims to bring ground-breaking concepts to the layer one space, featuring novel consensus mechanisms, performance optimization, system security, and smart contract designs. Aptos offers new and novel innovations in consensus, smart contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. Some of the key features of Aptos include: Native integration of Move: Move is a Rust-based programming language for fast and secure transaction execution. Flexible key management and hybrid custodial options: Aptos aims to provide a safer and more trustworthy user experience. Modular transaction processing: Transaction dissemination, block metadata ordering, transaction execution, batch storage, and ledger certification work in parallel. Atomicity without upfront knowledge of the data: This allows Aptos to increase throughput and decrease latency. Modular architecture: Allowing Aptos to offer frequent and instant upgrades. Innovative scaling solutions: Aptos supports internal sharding of a validator and homogeneous state sharding. How Does the Aptos Blockchain Work? PoS with advanced BFT consensus Aptos is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that employs a sophisticated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism, Light and full node clients Aptos categorizes its clients into two distinct groups \u2014 full node and light clients. Full node clients maintain a complete copy of the Aptos transaction ledger, while light clients store a streamlined version. Both types of clients communicate with validators to inquire about the ledger\u2019s history and current state before submitting transactions to be appended. Move programming language Aptos\u2019 whitepaper states that it employs the Move programming language\u2019s object model to depict the state of its ledger. Move, a relatively new programmable platform for blockchains, smart contracts, and other applications, was initially developed for Facebook (now Meta) for its discontinued crypto/blockchain projects, Libra and Diem. The Aptos team asserts that Move\u2019s advanced smart contract language is ideal for facilitating swift and secure transactions. Move simplifies the auditing and analysis of the blockchain and smart contracts that utilize it. Parallel transaction processing The Aptos blockchain supports parallel transaction processing, which is essential for achieving high scalability and throughput. By optimizing a multi-threaded, in-memory parallel engine using BlockSTM, it can deliver over 160,000 non-trivial Move transactions per second. The underlying infrastructure is designed for complex atomic transactions, ensuring transaction viability protection. Each transaction is fully completed or doesn\u2019t occur at all. This approach enables secure peer-to-peer trustless transactions with no intermediary. Conclusion Since its inception, Aptos has successfully integrated various projects. This is a promising development, as it expands the ecosystem\u2019s reach and potential for growth. With its current trajectory and sub-second transaction times, the Aptos crypto project holds the potential to surpass many of its rivals in the long run, provided it continues on this path. However, it is advised to research and conduct good investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.","article_summary":"Aptos Price Prediction 2024-2033 APTOS is carving its niche in a highly competitive market.

How High Can Bitcoin Rise Post Halving? In an X post on Saturday, econometrics shared a strong bullish prediction of Bitcoin price following the fourth halving event on April 19.

However, other speculators have attacked this prediction, believing BTC will likely soon experience some level of diminishing returns. Thus, such a high price level seems unfeasible. In response, econometrics stated that Bitcoin currently operates similarly to \u201cmegacap tech stocks\u201d, which have shown notable defiance to this economic theory. However, the analyst acknowledged that $4,500,000 may be an unrealistic price target for BTC, but there is much confidence that the digital asset will achieve a mid-six-figure value. Bitcoin Price Overview Bitcoin is currently trading at $65,043, with a modest 2.21% gain over the last 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume has declined massively, falling by 52.88% to a substantial $21.62 billion, underscoring decreased market activity and investor interest. Over the past week, Bitcoin has also shown fair improvement resulting in a total gain of 1.86%. However, despite these recent gains, the monthly chart reflects a decline of 4.16%, following some significant price dips and massive liquidations in the past week. On a larger scale, Bitcoin remains quite impressive, with its year-to-date growth percentage of 131.69%.

However, other speculators have attacked this prediction, believing BTC will likely soon experience some level of diminishing returns. Thus, such a high price level seems unfeasible. In response, econometrics stated that Bitcoin currently operates similarly to \u201cmegacap tech stocks\u201d, which have shown notable defiance to this economic theory. However, the analyst acknowledged that $4,500,000 may be an unrealistic price target for BTC, but there is much confidence that the digital asset will achieve a mid-six-figure value.

However, despite these recent gains, the monthly chart reflects a decline of 4.16%, following some significant price dips and massive liquidations in the past week. On a larger scale, Bitcoin remains quite impressive, with its year-to-date growth percentage of 131.69%.

Typically, the TD Sequential indicator comprises two major phases known as the \u201csetup\u201d and the \u201ccountdown.\u201d The setup phase consists of nine consecutive candlesticks depending on whether the token is in a bullish or bearish trend.

While the price of BTC did not witness a dramatic change following the halving, transaction fees spiked to unprecedented highs. Amidst the massive competition, a mining pool identified as ViaBTC had successfully mined the 840,000th Bitcoin block. Cumulatively, BTC users had spent a staggering $37.7 BTC in mining fees, equivalent to $2.4 million, recording the highest fee ever paid for a Bitcoin block. According to reports from mempool, after ViaBTC had produced the 840,000th block, the protocol had initiated an automated reduction of miners\u2019 reward by half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. In addition to the fees, ViaBTC had received a total payout of 40.7 BTC, valued at approximately $2.6 million, for mining the historic block.

This event is significant as it is expected to have several implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the crypto market going forward. What To Expect Following The Bitcoin Halving The Bitcoin halving slashed miners\u2019 rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each block mined. This means that Bitcoin miners are set to earn a reduced income of 450 BTC instead of the 900 BTC they earned before the fourth halving. This development is expected to have a dire effect on their operations, as NewsBTC reported that they could lose a whopping $10 billion following the halving. While the effects of the halving are not so pleasant for BTC miners, the halving is deemed necessary for the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It makes Bitcoin (BTC) deflationary by reducing the rate at which more tokens come into circulation. This could make the flagship crypto more scarce and ultimately drive up its value, as it has done in the past three halvings. In anticipation of history repeating itself, crypto analysts and experts have made several predictions about how high Bitcoin could rise this time post-halving. So far, the most bullish price prediction remains by Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner, who predicts that the flagship crypto could rise to $1 million this year. He added that this unprecedented price surge was possible considering that BTC\u2019s demand is expected to continue outpacing the supply, with more institutional investors recently getting on board through the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The imbalance between Bitcoin\u2019s supply and demand is also why crypto analyst MacronautBTC believes Bitcoin could rise to $237,000. Billionaire Tim Draper also agrees that Bitcoin could attain such heights based on his prediction that the flagship crypto will hit $250,000 in 2025. Implications On The Broader Crypto Market Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently predicted a narrative shift post-halving. He expects Bitcoin to take months to consolidate while altcoins significantly move to the upside during this period. This is plausible, considering Bitcoin doesn\u2019t experience that parabolic price surge until about six months after the halving. During this period, altcoins like XRP and Cardano (ADA), which have underperformed up until now, will be closely monitored as investors wait to see if they will show any sign of bullish momentum in them. Ethereum (ETH) will also be the focus of many in the crypto community as they watch how the second-largest crypto token by market cap will perform while Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates.

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley\u2019s recent proclamation has sent ripples through the industry, forecasting a staggering surge in Bitcoin ETF holdings by wealth management firms by the end of 2024. This prediction underscores a broader trend of growing institutional interest and confidence in Bitcoin, signaling a new era for digital asset adoption. Bitcoin ETFs Gain Momentum Amidst Changing Market Dynamics The emergence of Bitcoin ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle for institutional investors is highlighted by the rapid ascent of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which stands on the cusp of surpassing Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the largest Bitcoin fund globally. With IBIT\u2019s assets swelling to approximately $17.3 billion, just $2 billion shy of GBTC\u2019s, the stage is set for a potential changing of the guard within the market. This shift in dominance reflects a broader trend of institutional reallocation, as evidenced by significant outflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC in recent months. By the end of 2024, people are going to be stunned by how many wealth management firms own a bitcoin ETF. They\u2019re smart, many extremely well informed, and increasingly share conviction on Bitcoin. Oh, and they\u2019re long only. Going to be an amazing new constituent in the\u2026 \u2014 Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) April 20, 2024 While Grayscale\u2019s early-mover advantage in the Bitcoin ETF market has begun to wane, other institutional heavyweights such as Fidelity and BlackRock are stepping into the fray with notable net inflows into their respective Bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity and BlackRock Bitcoin ETFs witnessed substantial net inflows of $37.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively, in a single week, signaling a shift in investor sentiment and liquidity dynamics. Bitcoin ETFs: A Stepping Stone For Institutional Adoption Behind the scenes, registered investment advisers (RIAs) and multifamily offices are quietly embracing Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant milestone in the broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial institutions. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley describes this phenomenon as \u201cstealthy but material,\u201d indicating a growing recognition of Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a legitimate asset class. In response to market demand and the impending Bitcoin halving, institutional behemoths are conducting extensive studies and incorporating Bitcoin into their investment portfolios. This shift represents a fundamental reevaluation of traditional investment strategies, as institutions seek to diversify their holdings and capitalize on the potential upside of Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Bitcoin ETFs are poised to play a pivotal role in driving institutional adoption and reshaping the financial landscape. With BlackRock\u2019s IBIT on the verge of eclipsing Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and institutional investors flocking to Bitcoin ETFs in record numbers, the stage is set for a new era of digital asset investment.

Nigerian Authorities Trace Fleeing Binance Exec To Kenya \u2013 Report Tax Case Adjourned Over Legal Standstill On March 22, the Nigerian Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) charged Binance and two of its executives, namely Nadeen Ahjarwalla, head of financial crime compliance, and Tigran Gambaryan, regional manager for Africa, with four counts of tax evasion. These charges included \u201cnon-payment of Value-Added Tax, non-payment of Company Income Tax, failure to tax returns and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform\u201d, which the FIRS believed occurred from the failure of Binance to initially undergo a registration process before offering its services to Nigerians. According to local news media BusinessDay, the case was presented for hearing on April 19, with only Tigran Gimbaryan present in court as Nadeen Ahjarwhalla has long fled the West African nation. Gimbaryan is reported to have refused to take a plea as the FIRS had failed to serve Binance any tax evasion charges. However, the prosecution argued that the US citizen should defend the interests of himself and the crypto exchange against the charges being presented. In response, Gambaryan\u2019s lawyer stated that since all parties were jointly charged, Binance, being the primary defendant, must be served by the IRS before his client could plead his case in accordance with the Nigerian constitution. Following the legal impasse, Justice Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court Abuja ruled the case be adjourned to May 17, when he will provide a definite judgment. This represents the second time the FIRS\u2019s tax evasion case against Binance has been adjourned following an initial postponement on April 4 due to the failure of the Nigerian tax regulator to serve Gambaryan ahead of a stipulated court trial. Binance Troubles In Nigeria Continue The Binance exchange is currently stuck in a hostile regulatory situation with the Nigerian government. Aside from tax evasion charges, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has also accused the prominent crypto exchange of laundering over $35 million. The Nigerian government has increased regulatory scrutiny of Binance after accusing the exchange of playing a major role in the massive devaluation of the Nigerian naira via speculation and rate fixing. These allegations were followed by the arrest of Gimbaryan and Ahjarwhalla, who had visited the West African nation on February 26 after reports of the government banning certain access to Binance and other crypto exchanges. Binance has disabled all naira services on its platform and appears committed to resolving all legal issues around the detention of its employees after the exchange\u2019s CEO, Richard Teng, recently confirmed a willingness to cooperate with the Nigerian government.

The new fund, which was first announced in March, is expected to operate independently and offer a cost-effective investment option to GBTC shareholders. Grayscale Offers Industry-Low Fee With New Fund According to a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset manager Grayscale plans to set the fees for its new Bitcoin Mini Trust at one-tenth of the current 1.5% fee for GBTC. The 0.15% fee would make the fund the cheapest amongst the 11 Bitcoin ETFs approved in early January, followed by Franklin Templeton\u2019s fund at 0.19%. The filing revealed that Grayscale intends to disburse 63,620 bitcoins, or 10% of the Bitcoin held by GBTC at the beginning of the year (equivalent to roughly $4 billion), towards the Mini Trust\u2019s initial distribution. This $4 billion distribution would make the fund the fourth-largest Bitcoin spot ETF by asset under management (AUM), behind BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, Fidelity FBTC, and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC itself. As earlier reported by Bitcoinist, existing GBTC shareholders will receive stock in Grayscale Mini Trust. The asset manager plans to list the fund on the New York Stock Exchange Arca under the ticker \u201cBTC\u201d and expects the product to begin trading on the exchange immediately after the initial distribution.

In a public statement released on Friday, the US-based advocacy group heavily criticized the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, describing it as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and anti-innovation. Related Reading: \u2018Ethereum Wins Big\u2019 With New US Stablecoin Draft Bill: Expert Latest Stablecoin Bill Is Bad Policy: Coin Center On Wednesday, senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill on stablecoin payments. This bipartisan proposed legislation aims to protect investors\u2019 interest as the popularity and adoption of stablecoins as a \u201ccomfortable\u201d substitute to the US dollar have risen over the past few years. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act includes many crucial provisions, including strict compliance of stablecoin operators with existing US anti-money laundering and sanction regulations. Furthermore, this bill also proposes the creation of a federal and state regulatory framework that maintains the seamless existence of the dual banking system. Importantly, the bipartisan bill requires all stablecoin issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves, effectively outlawing the use of algorithmic stablecoins, i.e., stablecoins, which depend on a computer program to adjust their supply in response to changes in demand. This particular provision has drawn many reactions from the digital asset community, with many viewing such laws as anti-crypto. In particular, the Coin Center described this proposed regulation as a bad policy. The crypto advocacy group stated that prohibiting the use of algorithmic stablecoins can be interpreted as a ban on publishing code which would be unconstitutional in accordance with the provisions of the First Amendment Rights. However, Coin Center also acknowledged the concern over algorithmic stablecoins following the crash of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in 2022. They propose that the US Senate House mandates issuers of these tokens to register with the SEC rather than implementing a total ban on algorithmic stablecoins which they view as \u201canti-innovation.\u201d The US pro-crypto group also highlights another solution in the \u201cClarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,\u201d introduced in 2021, which seeks to compel all newly launched algorithmic stablecoins to undergo a two-year moratorium. While Coin Center does not agree with the proposed moratorium, they believe such legislation is still reasonable as it does not propose a total ban or threaten the \u201cfree speech\u201d of developers. Stablecoin Supply Rises By 22% In 2024 In other news, the global stablecoins market has continued to expand all through 2024. According to data from DeFiLlama, the total stablecoins market cap has gained by 21.95 % from $139.342 billion on January 1, 2024, to its current value of $158.957 billion. Of these values, Tether USD (USDT) expresses an outright dominance of 69.10%, with its market cap valued at $109.84 billion. The only other stablecoin with a somewhat significant market share (20.90%) is the USD Coin (USDC) with a market cap of $33.223 billion. Other notable stablecoins include Dai (DAI), First Digital USD (FUSD), and Athena USDe (USDe).","article_summary":"Pro-crypto organization Coin Center is pushing against a new legislative bill targeted at regulating stablecoin use and operations.

According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, Shiba Inu is on its way to another major breakout after the current consolidation. The analyst sees the meme coin surging to $0.000081 and then a further 90% increase to hit a new all-time high. Continued Uptrend For Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen massive gains recently, rallying 280% from $0.00001178 on the last day of February to $0.00004456 on March 5. This surge allowed the dog meme coin to outperform most cryptocurrencies amidst a wider bull market, taking a lot of traders by surprise. This price surge was accompanied by an increase in trading volume. Kaiko data reveals that Shiba Inu saw the largest volume among meme coins at $31 billion in just one week. However, according to social media posts, analyst Javon Marks had predicted a surge as far back as October 2023, with a SHIB price target of $0.000081. In a recent update to his prediction, Javon noted that the price is set for even more growth, with the breakout target of $0.000081 still valid.

Furthermore, according to his analysis, a break and hold above $0.000081 could set the stage for another 90% upside to $0.0001553, a new all-time high for the meme coin. Current State Of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has reversed since reaching $0.00004456 and has majorly traded between $0.0000365 and $0.0000295 in the past week. On-chain data points to a surge in trading volume during this time period. Particularly, IntoTheBlock\u2019s large trader flow metric, which measures transactions greater than $100,000, has surged, reaching $578.11 million (17.62 trillion SHIB) on March 11th. The last 24 hours saw 9.94 trillion SHIB ($300.55 million) in large transactions. While this surge in trading volume could mean an increased accumulation from large traders, it could also mean a selloff, as indicated by the recent drop in price.

Lola, a SHIB enthusiast, listed on X, key factors that could contribute to the meme coin\u2019s growth in the near future.

However, despite its efforts, the coin has remained on a downward trend for several days following its inability to surpass its previous all-time high of $73,833. Will Bitcoin Continue Upward After This Rejection? At the time of writing, the price of BTC was trading around $63,846 which was about 27% down from its all-time high and was up by 0.06% in the last 24 hours. Although the price is trading below the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, on the daily chart it is still trading above the 100 SMA Looking at the support and resistance lines in the below image, it can be seen that the price has tried to break the support level of $59,579 twice and has failed. The first time Bitcoin reached this level, it pushed the price upward to create a new all-time high. Thus, now that it has hit this level again, it might push BTC even further. The circles in the image indicate the two points: Also, with the formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the image, the indicator suggests an upward movement as the RSI signal line is seen trending slightly above the 50% level. This also suggests that buyers are still very active in the market and against the sellers. The MACD indicator from the 4-hour chart also suggests that BTC might move upward as the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line. Both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are about to cross above the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend, as seen in the below image. Possible Trend That Could Play Out In other words, since the price of Bitcoin is trying the move upward, if it manages to break above the minor resistance level of $67,895.24, it might begin to move toward its major resistance level of $73,833.34. Furthermore, should prices surpass this level, it might even move further to create a new all-time high. On the contrary, if Bitcoin fails to move above its previous highs, it might move downward toward its previous support level of $59,579.72. If it breaks below the zone, the price might encounter a deeper correction to create a new low.","article_summary":"Bitcoin has been endeavoring to shift its trajectory from a downturn to an upswing.

Skeptical Caution","author":"Christian Encila","article_detailed_content":"Following the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving, investors and analysts are now divided over its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. With historical data serving as a guide, experts offer contrasting viewpoints on whether the event will trigger a surge in Bitcoin prices or lead to a sell-off. Bullish Outlook: Historical Trends, Institutional Interest Fuel Optimism Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, stands firmly in the bullish camp, citing historical patterns as evidence for a post-halving price rally. According to him, past halving events have been followed by substantial increases in Bitcoin prices over the long term. Hougan points to the reduction in new supply entering the market as a result of the halving, coupled with growing demand from institutional investors through spot Bitcoin ETFs, as key drivers for potential price appreciation. Skeptical Caution: Is The Halving Already Priced In? However, not everyone shares Hougan\u2019s optimism. Dan Dolev, Managing Director at Mizuho Securities, adopts a more skeptical stance, suggesting that the halving event may already be fully priced into the market. He warns of a potential \u201csell-the-news\u201d scenario, where investors who had previously anticipated the event may rush to sell once it occurs. Dolev points to the heightened publicity surrounding this year\u2019s halving compared to previous cycles, indicating that market expectations may have already been factored into current prices. Institutional Interest And Market Maturation Jeff Hancock, CEO of Coinpass, offers a nuanced perspective, highlighting the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a real asset. He believes that Bitcoin has transitioned from being viewed as a speculative asset to a legitimate investment opportunity, particularly in light of high inflation and interest rates in traditional markets. Hancock points to the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed over $60 billion in assets in a relatively short period, as evidence of institutional demand for cryptocurrency exposure. Symbolic Significance Of The Fourth Halving Thomas Perfumo, Head of Strategy at Kraken, emphasizes the symbolic nature of the halving. He notes that this event marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin\u2019s history, with over 90% of the total supply already mined. Perfumo highlights the implication of less than 1% inflation in the circulating supply going forward, underscoring the scarcity and value proposition of Bitcoin as a digital asset. As the Bitcoin halving drew to a close, conflicting perspectives abound regarding its impact on the cryptocurrency market. While some experts remain bullish, anticipating a price surge driven by supply scarcity and institutional demand, others urge caution, warning of potential market dynamics already priced into current valuations.

This leaves investors vulnerable to losing their digital assets and experiencing financial setbacks. Typically, phishing scams occur when an attacker sends deceptive emails with links to malicious websites, aiming to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, wallet address information, credit card numbers and bank account information. These scams are socially engineered to deceive crypto investors through different forms of communication. To safeguard the interests of Shiba Inu holders, Shibarmy Scam Alert has warned community members to never click the link or picture in these phishing emails.

This underscores the need for SHIB investors to remain Informed of any suspicious activities within the community. It also emphasizes the importance of exerting caution when interacting with unsolicited messages on social media from unidentified individuals.

Read on as we discuss two issues: the market recovery and BEFE, an investment opportunity of a lifetime. Market Recovery Bound to Happen Next Week Nearly a week has passed, and the overall trading volume in the market has fallen just above the $100 billion threshold. In the last 24 hours, the market value of Bitcoin has rebounded by nearly 3%. This uptick in price action came shortly after Bitcoin fell to a lower low of $59,698 early on Friday. Market experts are in support of a total turn-around in the price action of Bitcoin and the others early next week. They believe that the alignment of key market conditions, such as macroeconomics and increased buying pressure, will be sufficient to drive the market upward. BEFE, An Investment Opportunity Of A Lifetime While BEFE might be a relatively new meme coin on the market, after a launch without presale or imposed taxes last December, BEFE might just be the most lucrative project of 2024. Since its debut in the market scene, BEFE\u2019s price performance has left investors and crypto enthusiasts short of words, racking up an impressive 500% in less than four weeks and enjoying successive pumps of 300% and 200% in the next few weeks. BEFE\u2019s impressive performance in price action has pulled in investors of all categories from all over the market. Beyond BEFE\u2019s purpose of restoring the golden days of meme coins, BEFE also adds utility by partnering with reputable players like Bitgert. Through the partnership, $BEFE could be earned when users stake $BRISE within Bitgert\u2019s ecosystem. Moreover, BEFE\u2019s strategic alliances with the big players have increased its market credibility and its potential for further developments in the long term, which resonates with savvy investors in the market. BEFE, now one of the biggest hypes in the market, has become one of the most discussed projects within the crypto community.

The Bitgert Growth in the Community Bitgert was launched in the market in late 2021 and that too for supporting the decentralization task and improving the current work status of blockchain networks.

Bitgert makes use of the latest innovations and has PoA and PoS consensus mechanisms as a mixture of the two. The combination of these two mechanisms helps in reducing the need for computation and also the number of validators. Moreover, the Bitgert chain offers all the transactions at 100k TPS which makes the whole network go viral for the speed itself. The speed does not compromise on safety either as safety protocols make Bitgert one of the most efficient and secure networks.

Then the increasing market cap of the token makes it much more trustworthy for investments. Even the market correction could not stop Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin train and it made nearly 70% in profit. Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin has an RSI score over 55 which means that there is a strong buy signal for the token. The MACD value, moving average and the trading volume of the token are also increasing rapidly. Conclusion It can be seen that Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin has been having the time of its life since its launch. Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin does not need any support as it already has a lot of features to speed up it. So, if anyone wants to invest in any asset, then Bitgert\u2019s BRISE coin seems to be the best option. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Being one of the first exchanges in the DeFi market, it has become a favorite for many crypto enthusiasts, controlling over 19% of the DeFi market value and amassing over $4 Billion in market cap. However, another trading platform is attempting to overtake Uniswap (UNI) at the top of the DeFi scene. The platform, ETFSwap (ETFS), has wooed many institutional investors with its innovative approach and abundant potential. That is why its presale is selling fast, with over 19 million tokens already sold. This article will reveal what it is about ETFSwap (ETFS) that institutional investors find so attractive and how you can join the winning team before the presale ends. Why ETFSwap Overtake Uniswap (UNI) To Become King Of DeFi ETFSwap (ETFS) is a decentralized platform that aims to bridge the gap between exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) world. It plans to accomplish this by tokenizing these ETFs on the blockchain to provide ample liquidity for traders. This unique model comes at a time when institutional interest in cryptocurrencies is at its peak, with over ten crypto ETFs approved for trading in the United States alone. These ETFs have brought Billions of Dollars of liquidity into the crypto world, fuelling the start of the bull market and propelling Bitcoin (BTC) to new highs. However, while this is good news for the general crypto market, these ETFs are only available for trading on the centralized entities that offer them. This goes against the principle of decentralization, on which blockchain technology is firmly founded. Many of these ETFs cannot also be easily converted into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. The ETFSwap platform is the perfect solution to these problems. It offers spot and future crypto ETFs, along with commodity, market, and fixed-income ETFs. These ETFs can easily be traded into fiat or popular cryptocurrencies with up to 10x leverage. The cherry on top is that no KYC process is required from anyone who desires to trade. Talk about complete decentralization! This is a unique product because there is currently no other platform offering this blend of ETF accessibility with on-chain technology and real-time conversions. What is more, this product is still in its infancy, offering a rare opportunity for interested investors to be early birds in a blue-chip project. So, how can you latch on to this unique opportunity? Find out below How To Join The ETFS Presale The ETFSwap (ETFS) team has successfully raised about $750,000 in a private sale round. This was done with investment from three angel investors and two institutional investors. The private sale was followed by the first stage of the presale, with over 19.5 million tokens sold so far at the low price of $0.00854. Stage 2 of the presale will kick off with each token selling for $0.01831. The team has also engaged in an extensive audit of its platform with the help of Cyberscope, a renowned blockchain security platform. The audit performed by Cyberscope pronounced the ETFS token free from security vulnerabilities and ensured that the entire platform was safe to transact. Thus, you have nothing to fear when you invest. Experts have speculated that the ETFS token will easily reach $1 when fully launched. This represents a massive return on investment for smart investors who join the presale now. You can buy with credit and debit cards. You can also buy with BNB, USDC, BUSD, ETH, and USDT.

Hopefully, when such great changes take place in Bitcoin, there will certainly be ripple effects across the cryptocurrency spectrum. Bitgert investors must keep an eye on the developments. Decoding Bitgert Halving Bitcoin halving is the term used to describe the hardwired process into Bitcoin chain: the halving of a mining reward for a new block every four years, more or less. This is a part of the consensus rules in Bitcoin: it forces an absolute hard cap on the total supply of bitcoins, limited to 21 million. Accordingly, the mining reward determined by the protocol started at 50 bitcoins per block. After the earliest 2012 halving, this reward was cut to 25 bitcoins, and it has halved afterward every four years. The halving is done to control the rate at which new bitcoins enter the system, much like how only a controlled amount of some metals and other precious items, like gold and silver, were made available to the market at given times. This diminishing supply schedule highlights the scarcity of Bitcoin and may serve to drive up its value, so long as demand remains at current levels or rises. This predictable supply decrease is substantive, as it impacts the profitability of miners, which is a substantial factor in the security and decentralization of the network. What is Bitgert Coin? Bitgert (BRISE) is a multi-chain-based project. In other words, it gives its blockchain, which provides audited crypto wallets, swaps, and exchanges for staking. The team achieved the following developments impressively within just 200 days of their launch. For this aim, Bitgert token incentivizes holders by staking rewards in BUSD and has the function of buying back to make price growth and scarcity happen. Currently, Bitgert tokens can be traded on various platforms \u2013 PancakeSwap (v2) being the most actively used of them all. The trading volume of Bitgert recorded in the last 24 hours: was $1,909,865. Such indicates that in recent days there was a little down in market activity. While BRISE is currently trading 14.12% down from its all-time high, registered in March 2022, the coin has seen a great run from its all-time low, calling attention to the volatility but potentially rewarding investment. The market cap of Bitgert is $66,121,173, and the fully diluted valuation being slightly higher at $71,364,123. This difference illustrates potential market growth if all tokens were to be issued, indicating long-term prospects. Surely, Bitgert would see a big push amidst Bitcoin halving, which usually arouses growing interest and prices in the crypto market. Can Bitgert Ride the Halving Wave? In short, it is expected that Bitgert and all the Bitgert-timed nascent coins will be able to scale in this upcoming time. Although Bitgert tends to be the most innovative of them all due to the utility-centric, future-driven ecosystem it has. If expectations of significant profits with Bitgert persist, an investor of reason should look at review platforms regarding the market dynamics before deciding to buy in.

This unfolds as the broader crypto community is showing greater resilience amid Bitcoin\u2019s halving. A few projects are however attracting as much attention as new crypto trading solution Bitbot. As Bitbot matches towards a highly successful presale, investors flocking to it are likely buoyed by what the project promises in the wake of events surrounding ZKasino, a decentralized betting network. While the ZKasino team says the project will still launch as expected, it\u2019s likely to face challenges with regard to community trust after the rug pull allegations and exchange listing delays. Bitbot brings non-custodial trading and anti-rug pull features to crypto Bitbot is one of the few emerging crypto projects that are pushing for market dominance. In particular, Bitbot\u2019s eyes are on the Telegram bot space, which analysts have predicted could explode as crypto prepares for the bull market proper. What makes Bitbot stand out in the market is its pioneering non-custodial trading feature. PAAL AI, Banana Gun, PaLM AI and Unibot have seen significant success since their launch. However, none of these solutions offer the industry-leading security that Bitbot pioneers with its non-custodial Telegram bot. When the bot launches in coming months, users will not only have the peace of mind of retaining full control of their assets as they trade, but also tap into additional security layers provided by anti-rug pull and anti-MEV tools. So it\u2019s not just Bitbot\u2019s non-custodial solution or its AI-powered trading tools, but also the protection users can get with the anti-rug pull feature. Bitbot team\u2019s transparency also adds to this positive outlook for the project, likely the reason the presale has raced to over $2.7 million. Ape Terminal cancels IDO for ZKasino (ZKAS) Following concerns around a potential rug pull, IDO platform Ape Terminal announced it had cancelled ZKasino\u2019s initial DEX offering. Ape Terminal\u2019s statement comes after ZigZag, a decentralised P2P orderbook exchange, published concerns about ZKasino and a potential $32 million rug pull. Meanwhile, ZKasino participants have reportedly been unable to withdraw their money as the platform\u2019s team has moved all 10,515 ETH from the deposit contract to Lido. Amid these allegations, some exchanges have announced paused listing plans of the ZKasino token ZKAS. Crypto exchange MEXC announced it would cancel ZKAS listing on Saturday. A lot of FUD going around. The ZKasino network will still go live, it has been delayed due to exchange listings. \u2014 ZKasino (@ZKasino_io) April 20, 2024 Ape Terminal said on April 21 that participants who opted into the crypto betting platform\u2019s DEX offering will receive a refund of their assets. Stablecoin claims are open, the platform posted on X. Bitbot presale could be key opportunity The Bitbot native token BITBOT will power the new trading bot, providing users with another investment opportunity. Top of this is the chance to earn a share of platform revenue. Other perks are outlined via the project\u2019s whitepaper. Currently, BITBOT token is priced at just $0.0163 in stage 11. As highlighted in the project\u2019s whitepaper, the presale price is scheduled to rise to $0.020 in stage 15, the final presale stage. Bitbot\u2019s launch will see it stand out as the only non-custodial Telegram trading bot in the market. Already, there\u2019s a strong community building around the project as its presale moves towards an end and the next few weeks could be an early opportunity for investors.

Kaspa: Which Will Be The First To Hit $1?","author":"Samuel Ronan","article_detailed_content":"Investors are scanning the market for cryptos under $1, especially Kaspa and Bitbot\u2019s meteoric rise. Kaspa has made notable strides. Bitbot is attracting serious investors, especially with its ongoing presale, which has already raised $2.1m. The presale stages for Bitbot are rapidly selling out, indicating a growing enthusiasm among investors eager to get on board before it lists on exchanges. This surge of investor interest showcases Bitbot\u2019s potential to compete with established cryptos like Kaspa and possibly outpace them in the race to hit the $1 milestone. Could Bitbot Be The Next Crypto To Reach $1? Bitbot revolutionizes how investors engage with the market through a Telegram trading bot that empowers users in a way never before possible. It empowers individual investors by allowing them to retain full custody of their assets. Bitbot\u2019s presale event presents an incredible opportunity for early investors to secure a stake in a project with massive potential for gains. Given the burgeoning trend for Telegram trading bots and the spectacular performance competitors experienced despite security breaches and limited functionality, Bitbot is poised to outshine its competitors. Bitbot \u2013 The game-changer in crypto trading Its pioneering features make Bitbot the quintessential tool for crypto enthusiasts. Telegram trading bots can catapult users to unprecedented market success. Bitbot partners with elite data platforms such as Birdeye, Dex Screener, and DexView. These partnerships enable Bibot to giive users a seamless interface brimming with indispensable market insights. Understanding the power of community and the viral nature of crypto tokens, Bitbot effortlessly streamlines token sharing. Users can unveil the next potential 100x gem to their Telegram groups with a click. For instance, consider the recent surge in PEPE; over 15,000% from its launch price to all-time high. Bitbot\u2019s technology could have been instrumental in identifying and sharing this opportunity early on, demonstrating its ability to uncover and distribute information about emerging trends with the potential to yield significant returns. But Bitbot doesn\u2019t stop there; it personalizes the trading experience with customized alerts and watchlists, ensuring that users are always in the loop on tokens that might pique their interest. In the future, Bitbot intends to transcend single-chain limitations by embracing cross-chain functionality. It will include some of the most dynamic ecosystems, including Solana, Base, BSC, and Ethereum mainnet. For instance, integrating Base blockchain can significantly benefit users by providing access to a highly scalable and efficient layer-2 solution, reducing transaction costs and times. This is crucial for traders looking to capitalize on fleeting market opportunities without the burden of high gas fees or slow transaction speeds often encountered on congested networks. Kaspa price prediction: Could KAS reach $1? While Kaspa has undoubtedly been a formidable influence in the blockchain sphere, its journey among cryptos under $1 appears challenging. With significant enhancements in its technical framework, such as the transition from Golang to Rust for improved performance and the integration with the Tangem cold storage wallet, Kaspa has solidified its position as a formidable Layer 1 PoW cryptocurrency. Yet, the current Kaspa price prediction paints a picture of a prolonged journey to $1, with a recent 22% decrease over the past month, settling around $0.13. Predictions suggest a modest climb to the $0.14 to $0.18 range, underscoring the considerable ground yet to cover. Crypto experts: Bitbot has the potential for 10-100x ROI Despite a weak Kaspa price prediction and regardless of the shadows cast by lesser projects, the market for Telegram trading bots has proven to be a goldmine for savvy investors, delivering remarkable returns. Banana Gun, for example, shot up by 291% in the past year and is currently priced at around $46 with over $120 million in market cap. Similarly, Unibot has gained roughly 17% in a similar period and is currently priced at around $20 with a market cap of over $20 million. Bitbot, with its AI integration and superior security features, stands on the cusp of capturing a significant market share out of $1.4 billion, the approximate Telegram trading bot market cap. The cumulative trading volume produced by Telegram trading bots is over $18 billion, with more than a 100% gain in 2024 alone. Plus, the market cap for the AI crypto market currently stands at around $40 billion. All these figures suggest that Bitbot taking even a small slice of this market will lead to notable gains for BITBOT token holders. This move could catapult its value by 10X in the short term, with projections soaring 50x or even 100x in the long run. Bitbot has a convincing case for the dominance of its niche and could make a superb investment. Unlike several second-rate trading bots that shy away from scrutiny, Bitbot\u2019s readiness to demonstrate its capabilities signals a foundation built on strength and transparency. The commitment is further evidenced by continuous engagement through Medium blog updates and AMA sessions. For example, the latest blog discusses the role of trading bots in democratizing access to cryptocurrency investments and highlights the meme coin trend, positioning Bitbot as a thought leader in the space. Technical Product Advisor Andrew Jacobs has responded to every query, illustrating the team\u2019s seriousness and Bitbot\u2019s genuine utility. Summary: Which of these two cryptos will be the first to hit $1? Bitbot\u2019s presale is rapidly approaching its final stages. Already in stage 9, those who invest today will see a 35.14% token price appreciation before the presale ends. And given both the elite level of the Bitbot project and strong market conditions, the BITBOT token price is beyond likely to surge further. With a less-than-ideal Kaspa price prediction, the race among cryptos under $1 is led by Bitbot, with the vibrant presale community, robust revenue-sharing model, and unparalleled expertise from its team of ex-Wall Street traders that seal Bitbot\u2019s fate as the ultimate investment.

On a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, a liquid staking token symbolizes the amount of cryptocurrency that has been staked. Liquid staking tokens provide more flexibility and liquidity, enabling staking while retaining the ability to purchase, sell, or trade the token. Liquid Staking: What Is It? Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, staking is a well-liked method of earning interest on holdings. In short, network users can operate a validator node by staking tokens, which can be cut or removed as a punishment if the node engages in malicious activity. Staking protects Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain networks. Staked tokens are often not convertible into cash or cannot be used as collateral for yield in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs): What Are They? Staking has developed into a crucial component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. Liquid staking tokens (LST) have surfaced as the cryptocurrency environment keeps changing, offering a new angle on staking. Staking usually entails locking up a predetermined quantity of tokens to maintain network functionality. Validating transactions and assisting with consensus techniques like Proof-of-Stake are two examples. Once staked, tokens typically become illiquid\u2014challenging to access or sell. This is the application of LSTs. Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) deal with the constraints of traditional staking by offering an extra bendy and person-friendly experience. Here\u2019s what makes them particular: Liquidity: LSTs constitute your staked tokens. When you stake your crypto on a liquid staking platform, you obtain equal LSTs in return. These LSTs are freely tradable on secondary markets, permitting you to preserve liquidity even while your unique tokens are staked. Accessibility: Liquid staking platforms often have lower minimal stake requirements than standard staking techniques. This makes staking more accessible to a much more comprehensive range of buyers, irrespective of their crypto holdings. Reduced Slashing Risk: Some liquid staking protocols employ a \u201cslashing protection\u201d mechanism. This manner that although the validator you\u2019re delegated to is slashed, your staked tokens and the corresponding LSTs remain secure. How Liquid Staking Works The process of liquid staking typically includes the following steps: Choose a Liquid Staking Platform: Several reputable liquid staking platforms are available, each with features and supported tokens. Deposit Your Crypto: Deposit the cryptocurrency you need to stake onto the chosen platform. Receive LSTs: Your deposit will include an equivalent quantity of LSTs. These tokens constitute your staked crypto and are freely tradable. Staking and Rewards: The liquid staking platform mechanically stakes your deposited tokens on your behalf. You\u2019ll earn staking rewards, usually reflected in the growing cost of your LST holdings. Benefits of Using LSTs There are numerous blessings to utilizing LSTs on your staking needs: Increased Flexibility: LSTs offer liquidity in your staked property, permitting you to shop for, sell, or exchange them even as your original tokens are locked up. Accessibility: Lower minimal stake necessities make staking more handy to a broader range of buyers. Potential for Higher Returns: Some liquid staking systems provide extra rewards on top of the base staking rewards, potentially increasing your standard returns. Reduced Slashing Risk: Slashing safety mechanisms provided by a few structures offer peace of mind for stakers. Potential Drawbacks To Consider While LSTs offer giant benefits, there also are a few capacity drawbacks not to forget: Counterparty Risk: You rely on the liquid staking platform to securely manage your staked assets. It\u2019s critical to pick a good platform with a sturdy music report. Fees: Liquid staking structures can also charge fees for their services, which could deplete your staking rewards. Newer Technology: Liquid staking is a new generation compared to conventional staking. While the future seems promising, there\u2019s usually the capability for unforeseen dangers. Types of Liquid Staking Tokens Liquid staking tokens can be categorized into two main types: rebasing and reward-bearing. Rebasing Tokens: These tokens have a flexible supply that can increase or decrease based on staking rewards. For example, Lido\u2019s stETH token expands its supply to reflect staking rewards. Reward-Bearing Tokens: Unlike rebasing tokens, reward-bearing tokens maintain a fixed supply while capturing the value of staking rewards. Instead of increasing in quantity, these tokens increase in value. Coinbase\u2019s cbETH follows this model. In some jurisdictions, reward-bearing tokens may offer tax advantages, as the rewards are incorporated into the token\u2019s value rather than increasing quantity. It can defer taxation until the asset is sold or disposed of. In addition to these two main types, there is a less common method known as the dual token model, which utilizes two separate tokens: one representing the staked asset and the other representing staking rewards. Frax uses this model for its ETH liquid staking tokens. Wrapped tokens are another essential concept. These tokens lock the original asset in a smart contract to create a new token with enhanced usability. For example, Lido\u2019s stETH can be wrapped to become wstETH, allowing it to earn staking rewards while maintaining compatibility with various DeFi protocols and blockchains. What is the difference between staking and liquid staking? The fundamental difference between staking and liquid staking lies in the flexibility of the assets. In traditional staking, customers lock their tokens into clever contracts for a predetermined duration in exchange for rewards. The tokens are inaccessible and can not be traded or transferred during this time. On the other hand, liquid staking allows token holders to change their tokens while earning staking rewards. This flexibility permits customers to actively manipulate their belongings and participate in buying and selling activities while benefiting from staking rewards. However, it\u2019s vital to note that the rewards in liquid staking can be slightly lower than those in conventional staking methods. Additionally, liquid staking typically involves much less energetic participation in governance choices than standard staking. The Final Word Staked tokens are locked assets that can only be spent, exchanged, used as collateral, or farmed. Liquid staking tokens make these tokens liquid. Liquid staking tokens allow for any-time trading and provide a more convenient means of earning a staking yield for many investors. But, as the token is tradable, you can also use it to make extra money with well-known DeFi apps like Uniswap and Aave.","article_summary":"1 Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) let you trade tokens and earn rewards simultaneously. 2 They come in two types: rebasing tokens adjust supply while reward-bearing tokens maintain a fixed supply and capture staking rewards. On a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, a liquid staking token symbolizes the amount of cryptocurrency that has been staked. Liquid staking tokens provide more flexibility and liquidity, enabling staking while retaining the ability to purchase, sell, or trade the token. Liquid Staking: What Is It? Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, staking is a well-liked method of earning interest on holdings.

He has been in the telecom industry for 25 years, serving multiple regions with mobile internet GSM to 4G. Andreas launched Cajutel to digitally revolutionize West Africa with reliable, high-speed, and affordable internet. Andreas Carrier Timeline Andreas attended ETH Zürich from 1985 to 1987, where he studied Electrotechnics but did not obtain any degree. Andreas started his career in 2007 as the CEO at iCell ehf and later took on the CEO role at Montelcom in 2012. In 2010, he founded DataCell ehf, which provides green data center services. In the same year, Andreas became the CEO of Backbone ehf, an international internet transit and capacity provider. In 2014, he took over as CEO at Cajutel Sarl and Cajutel Inc. in 2015, focusing on telecom services. From 2001 to 2015, Andreas worked with SMSRelay AG, specializing in SMS services and infrastructure. He is also the Director of the signaling department at AMD Telecom S.A. since 2017. Along with leadership roles, Andreas has worked as a telecommunications specialist, a software developer, and a CTO during their career. Andreas\u2019 Biggest Project Yet Cajutel aims to provide internet access to people in Western Africa, where the internet penetration rate is only 10%. Andreas talked about the project, stating that unlike Europe, where one can use a credit card daily, Western Africa still needs blockchain due to a lack of internet. Cajutel is trying to solve this by launching an ICO and introducing the internet and payments through cryptocurrencies, changing the shape of these countries. Andreas is currently focused on providing internet access to the people of Africa through Cajutel, which requires significant funding. The project has a native token known as CAJ. It is often called tokenized evolution in West Africa. Andreas stated that only 10% of the people in Africa have access to the internet. Andreas\u2019 Struggles Andreas finds challenges enjoyable and desires to create long-lasting solutions that benefit people. In 2014, he initiated the Cajutel project to address issues he observed in the country. Despite struggling to secure traditional investors, he leveraged cryptocurrency to expand investment opportunities and minimize risk. He believes that going public with a coin was the right choice. Cajutel\u2019s Unique Selling Point Cajutel\u2019s unique selling point (USP) is that, unlike Europe\u2019s telemarketing industry, which is known for its cut-throat competition, Western Africa has only mobile operators as competitors. Additionally, Cajutel is collaborating with the government on a large-scale project to provide internet access to over 1000 schools. Andreas also discusses how non-profit organizations (NPOs) will assist with the educational programs offered in these schools. According to the CEO, Cajutel\u2019s strategy is to create something that is not dependent on other companies. This is particularly challenging in Africa, as significant multinationals may cut off competitors. To achieve independence, one has to build one\u2019s infrastructure, which is more expensive but has long-term benefits.","article_summary":"Andreas Fink, who is deeply involved in telecommunications in Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Switzerland, is the CEO of Datacell and Cajutel.

By pledging not to sell or change their cryptocurrency holdings, absolutely everyone can earn UNI.In proportion to their UNI ownership, UNI holders manipulate the Uniswap platform. A prominent player in the market, Uniswap provides customers with a decentralized exchange technology that makes token swaps easy. The UNI coin, essential to the Uniswap platform\u2019s governance and incentives, is the center of this ecosystem. This extensive tutorial will examine the definition of Uniswap Exchange, the UNI token\u2019s foundations, and its significance in decentralized finance. What Is Uni? Uniswap distinguishes itself as a decentralized change (DEX) that operates without a central authority. It was founded in 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, helps ERC-20 tokens, and works with primary wallet services such as MetaMask and MyEtherWallet. One of its first-rate factors is its open-supply nature, which lets every person breed the code and construct their personal DEX. Unlike conventional exchanges, which fee exorbitant charges to list new cash, Uniswap allows users to list tokens without cost. Furthermore, being decentralized guarantees that users keep possessing their property, which protects them in opposition to destiny hacks. Uniswap has emerged as a distinguished player in decentralized finance (DeFi), with more than $3 Billion in crypto belongings locked on its platform. How Uniswap Works Uniswap runs on two intelligent contracts, the \u201cFactory\u201d and the \u201cExchange\u201d contracts. These contracts are automatic programs that perform specific tasks when certain circumstances are met. The Factory contract creates new tokens for the network, whereas the Exchange contract permits token swaps or user transactions. The Uniswap v.2 platform allows users to exchange any ERC20-based coin. To address liquidity difficulties typical in centralized exchanges, Uniswap employs an automated liquidity mechanism. This protocol encourages users to become liquidity providers (LPs) by combining their funds to form a liquidity pool. Each cryptocurrency featured on Uniswap has its pool, which users can donate to help facilitate exchanges. A mathematical algorithm decides the price of each token. With this system, trades can be executed instantly at a known price without an opposite party appearing. In exchange for providing liquidity, LPs receive a token representing their contribution to the pool. These tokens can be redeemed for a share of the trading fees, which Uniswap charges at a flat rate of 0.30% for every trade. These fees are automatically sent to a liquidity reserve. When a liquidity provider decides to exit, they receive a portion of the total fees from the reserve relative to their stake in the pool. The token representing their stake is then destroyed. A protocol fee was introduced after the Uniswap v.2 upgrade, allowing 0.05% of every 0.30% trading fee to be allocated to a Uniswap fund for future development. If activated, LPs would receive 0.25% of pool trading fees. The UNI Token The UNI coin is the Uniswap protocol\u2019s native governance token. It was issued in September 2020 via a community airdrop. Holders of UNI tokens can vote on Uniswap platform ideas, protocol updates, and fee structures. UNI is the native token of the Uniswap protocol. It serves several crucial functions: Governance: UNI token holders have vote-casting rights on proposals to improve the Uniswap protocol. It fosters community involvement and decentralized decision-making. Incentives: A portion of the trading fees on Uniswap are allotted to liquidity companies that contribute their tokens to liquidity pools. This incentive system encourages users to maintain healthy pool levels and enables clean buying and selling. Reduced Trading Fees: Users who hold UNI can experience reductions in buying and selling costs on the Uniswap platform. Critical Functions Of UNI Token: Governance: The Uniswap protocol\u2019s path and evolution are prompted by pointers for governance that UNI token holders can submit and vote on. This democratic governance paradigm guarantees both decentralization and network involvement. Liquidity mining: By giving liquidity carriers UNI tokens as payment, Uniswap encourages them. Users are endorsed to contribute to liquidity pools via liquidity mining schemes, which improves the change\u2019s performance and liquidity. Fee Sharing: A portion of the trading costs made on the Uniswap platform are awarded to holders of UNI tokens. This method aligns token holders\u2019 interests with the protocol\u2019s sustainability and achievement. Benefits of Using Uniswap Here\u2019s what makes Uniswap an appealing choice for crypto buyers: Permissionless Trading: Anyone with a crypto wallet can buy and sell on Uniswap without registration or verification. Security: Users manage their private keys and crypto property during trading. Transparency: All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness. Wide Range of Tokens: Uniswap helps a vast array of tokens and sets up cryptocurrencies and rising DeFi initiatives. Drawbacks To Consider While Uniswap gives extensive benefits, there are also some ability drawbacks to consider: Volatility: The AMM version can be susceptible to price volatility, specifically for less liquid tokens with smaller liquidity swimming pools. Transaction Fees: While typically lower than centralized exchanges, transaction fees on Uniswap can differ primarily based on community congestion. User Interface: The user interface of Uniswap is less intuitive for novices than some centralized exchanges. Uniswap And The Future Of DeFi Uniswap\u2019s impact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been profound. Introducing the Automated Market Maker (AMM) version revolutionized cryptocurrency trading. It caused substantial changes in DeFi, including: Increased Accessibility: Uniswap made crypto trading available to anybody by eliminating the want for centralized intermediaries. Now, each person with a crypto wallet can interact in trading, regardless of their vicinity or any restrictions. Enhanced Transparency: The AMM model operates through clever contracts, ensuring all transactions are prominent and recorded on the blockchain. This transparency builds trust and safety in the DeFi ecosystem. Community-Driven Governance: The UNI token gives holders vote-casting rights on proposals to improve Uniswap. This encourages network involvement and decentralized decision-making, aligning with DeFi\u2019s principles of possession and autonomy. Conclusion Uniswap Exchange and the UNI token constitute groundbreaking innovations inside decentralized finance. As the DeFi landscape continues to conform, Uniswap remains at the leading edge, supplying customers with an efficient and decentralized platform for token buying and selling and liquidity provision. With the UNI token serving as a cornerstone of governance and incentivization, the Uniswap ecosystem is poised for further increase and adoption in the ever-increasing world of decentralized finance.","article_summary":"Digital assets may be traded on Uniswap, a decentralized change.The Uniswap platform runs on the cryptocurrency known as UNI.

There is a question regarding the sustainability of the FET cryptocurrency\u2019s breakout. While some are optimistic about its future, others have concerns that it may eventually fade away. In the recent sessions, the price of FET decreased significantly, causing concern among investors. However, the bulls made a comeback after the price dropped below the 50-day EMA and a short-term consolidation was observed. Currently, the bulls are making an effort to recover as the FET price has broken out of the consolidation and 50-day EMA. However, investors are still apprehensive of another selling pressure since the volume inflow has not supported the breakout. Although recovery is possible, it is likely that FET price needs to show sustenance above the consolidation zone in order to validate the breakout and turn bullish.

The tests are carried out under DARPA\u2019s Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Project, which has been going on for the last four years. AI dogfights with human pilots Col. James Valpiani, commandant of the Air Force Test Pilot School, and Lt. Col. Ryan Hefron, program manager of the Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Project under DARPA, talked to press reporters in a teleconference about the testing. They said that a highly modified F-16 research aircraft called X-62 VISTA (Variable Stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft) was loaded with AI functionality, and it engaged in a number of dogfights against stock versions of F-16 that were flown by human pilots. The testing of the X-62 VISTA is part of the exercise carried out to evaluate the development of joint strike aircraft, aka Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), as the USAF is anticipating to develop more than one thousand by the next ten years. Sharing the limited details, they refused to reveal the findings of the initial dogfights, saying they were classified. But they said that the AI algorithms were first trained on non-dogfight flights on VISTA, and 21 mission flights were carried out before transitioning to dogfights starting back in 2022. The interesting part is that a different approach was carried out to train the AI. It was trained by allowing the algorithm to teach itself by running billions of simulations about how to control and maneuver the aircraft in a wide range of possibilities, different flying conditions, and rules of engagement for the mission, as they avoided the usual approach of feeding the system with hundreds of engagement reports of pilots. AI performs against human pilots with accuracy It was also told that various AI agents were onboard Vista along with two human pilots who switched between these agents to evaluate their performance, and the best part was that human pilots never had to take control of the aircraft from the AI during the entire run-up. According to Lt. Col. Hefron, the AI consistently performed better against human pilots during initial testing, which was carried out on simulators to verify the AI\u2019s capabilities, but he said that the simulator flights did not include the flying rules about not to stress the airframe to its breaking point. And that it was added to the algorithm before the live-fly sessions began. It was also made sure that the simulation flights were continuously safe before the actual live-fly engagements were carried out. Col. Valpiani said the students of the flight test school had a major role in planning the tests. According to him, VISTA was first flown defensively on AI and slowly put to more offensive roles, even coming as near as 2000 feet of a human opponent. Valpiani told that dogfighting is a dangerous engagement, and dozens of collisions have happened over the years in the F-16 and F/A-18 communities. According to him, it is one of the most demanding aerial skills to perfect, and for this very reason, all their emphasis was on safety. Gen. Mark D. Kelly, former head of Air Combat Command, had been insisting that before the Air Force involves in acquiring AI, fighter pilots must be satisfied completely with regards to safety and trust in the system. As they will be collaborating with it, and without their satisfaction, they will resist the tech. More tests will be carried out as the Air Force continues the program, and Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall will also fly in the VISTA to get firsthand experience of the system. The original story can be seen here.","article_summary":"On April 19, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the US Air Force jointly announced that they had conducted the first live-fly dogfights between human pilots and an AI-flown jet.

The reboot of the post-apocalyptic RPG Bethesda called Fallout 4 drew a lot of fans, especially on Xbox platforms. However, those players, who had returned found those achievements being unable to be unlocked. This disappointing inconvenience has been going on for a long time and players still get 0g even if they keep trying. Xbox has confirmed that the lingering achievements bug has been fixed now. This happens a few days before Fallout 4 receives their much anticipated next-gen upgrade set on 25th April. The bug seems to have first sprouted up in early March but was quickly acknowledged by Xbox staff. After around a month of waiting, the problem was finally resolved last week, much to the relief of Xbox gamers everywhere. A new beginning for Fallout 4 achievements Xbox players can get into the Commonwealth confidently without fearing their hard-acquired accomplishments being unrecorded with the issue now officially fixed. For the game veterans, it means at last being able to pick up where they left off and go on filling out that achievement list. Coming in, meanwhile, is equally immersive, offering the whole authentic experience upon the first launch \u2013 including unlocking the mere \u201cWelcome to the Wasteland\u201d achievement, which to this day confuses a good chunk of Xbox players that are unable to hit the proper button that summons the menu. Acquiring this medal is low on the mission value ladder as it only needs a player to complete just the tutorial mission and enter the game world, therefore, it will take very little effort to get the award. The more likely percentage of players who missed out this primary achievement is higher than normal because they stopped after playing a few minutes of Fallout 4 before getting over with it. However, to those who had to fight the issue during those hours and did not make it beyond the beginning, the efforts that were involved are now about to bear fruit. Next-gen Fallout 4 update is on the way Many Fallout fans both new and returning may choose to hold off a little longer just before jumping into the Commonwealth. The main reward in the field of view is certainly a big next-gen update, which will debut on April 25th for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. So, this next-gen makeover will boost the game\u2019s visuals through a series of optimizations and enhancements to the 2015 open-world epic; finally, the buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second performance will be available on next-gen consoles. Other improvements include better graphics quality, rendered distance improvement, and loading times becoming shorter and shorter now that the hardware\u2019s horsepower is stepped up. But for the ones who have been cautiously playing the backward compatible version or waiting entirely, it looks like the coming next-gen update would mean an opportunity to see Fallout 4 at its best-looking, smoothest-running self. The latest fixed gamerscore system will allow players to look through their progress and achievements without any obstacles and earn gamerscore while both watching and playing.","article_summary":"For the Xbox gamers who jumped right back into the Wasteland after feeling the magic by watching the award-winning Fallout TV show on Amazon, the annoying issue has finally been fixed.

Debates about Ethereum ETFs have been predominantly one-sided rather than the vibrant discussions associated with the trading sessions that preceded the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, very deftly sums up the SEC\u2019s position that \u201csilence is violence.\u201d The SEC\u2019s lack of feedback on Ethereum ETFs reduces the probability of their approval at this time. Balchunas makes a point that the SEC might receive another lawsuit if the applications of numerous Ethereum-backed ETFs are denied, which would indicate that either Grayscale or some other imaginative ETF issuers may challenge this decision. Ethereum ETFs hold edge over Bitcoin ETFs Geraci surmises that Eagle or other big-budget ETF issuers might sue the SEC for delaying the transaction of Ethereum ETFs. This is after Grayscale won its legal battle in August, wherein the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application. Geraci suggests that this kind of legal battle might be considered as a strategic marketing cost that gives a company a strong competitive advantage in the market. Eerily quiet on spot eth ETFs\u2026 Consensus is SEC will disapprove in May. Reason = lack of engagement w/ issuers.

Either way, options are either A) approve or B) face lawsuit IMO. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 21, 2024 Some have also questioned the value of spot Ethereum ETFs. Maybe that\u2019s the reason many of the launched future ETFs based on the value of the second-largest altcoin have not been welcomed well by the market. On the other hand, Geraci notes that the fact that Ethereum has the wave\u2019s huge market cap of $379 billion is something that analysts and issuers should not ignore. Although investors appear to have less interest in the futures-based Ethereum ETFs, Geraci asserts that the Ethereum ETFs matter due to the significant developments over the Bitcoin ETFs. SEC\u2019s silence signals disapproval of Ethereum ETFs The SEC staying mum on the prospect of ETFs based on Ethereum is a sign of the high disapproval of it in the short run, per the industry experts. The lack of direct contact with the issuers is the speculation fuel of the regulator\u2019s position on the broader Ethereum-related investment products. Despite Bitcoin ETFs leaping forward, no one really knows that new hurdles for Ethereum ETFs will be placed on the way. Analysts and market participants keep an eye on the SEC\u2019s further actions, analyzing possible epiphenomenons that the rejection of Ethereum ETFs will cause. The crypto industry is still in limbo as there is no clear regulatory framework around the corner. The crypto industry is to figure out further regulations regarding Ethereum investment products. While the challenges are not ignored, the proponents of the Ethereum ETF still believe that one day, it will be approved because of the reference of the cryptocurrency in the broader financial sector.","article_summary":"Nate Geraci, the President of the ETF Store, stated that a \u201cspot Ethereum ETF is not something the SEC would approve by May.\u201d The drought in communication between issuers and investors can be considered a weak selection for approval.

The agreement aims to assist the investor\u2019s actions against the celebrities who endorsed FTX, and to recover the investments lost as a result of this. Settlement with Bankman-Fried Pending court approval from the Southern District of Florida, the settlement attempts to comply with all demands brought forth by FTX shareholders. Alongside this, in return for abandoning actions brought against him, Bankman-Fried has committed to assisting the investors\u2019 legal team. This kind of joint work includes the presentation of documents and the production of witnesses for the sake of supporting the class-action lawsuit versus FTX and also aid in recovery of victims\u2019 funds. This conviction followed Bankman-Fried\u2019s 25-year term for fraud in connection with FTX\u2019s demise. Bankman-Fried will still need to contend with more civil charges in the FTX investor residual disputes. Pursuing Celebrity Endorsers Having won over Bankman-Fried\u2019s co-operation, investors are increasingly interested in the celebrity patrons of FTX now. The case concerns well-known personalities including Tom Brady, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, and Gisele Bundchen who supposedly passed FTX advertisements and shifted investors\u2019 funds. The arrangement entails Bankman-Fried cooperating with the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to identify and prosecute the celebrity endorsers that are involved. The investigation is designed to determine the degree to which celebrities acted as promoters of FTX and how closely they were linked to the exchange\u2019s management. Valuable Settlement The alliance with celebrity ambassadors was worth an estimated $1.3 million. This amount also comprises of payments to influencers, for example football quarterback, Trevor Lawrence for FTX endorsement in 2022. Similarly, the agreement also makes SBF divulge his assets that including his stake in anthropic which is an artificial intelligence startup.

According to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno, there was a sharp drop in transaction fees in spite of the notable increase in Rune traffic on the 20th of April. Although there were top transactions of over half a million dollars in the amount of fee, the network\u2019s fees plummeted sharply, unlike predicted, seeing the average users\u2019 impediment in the fee. Source: X Runner\u2019s analysis emphasized that Bitcoin\u2019s daily average transaction fees, despite still Runes\u2019 fans, were smaller than the high figures seen in late 2017 and early 2018. This reduction occurs at a time when there has been stronger activity of runes similar to the one in demand experienced when the BRC-20 token standard was first introduced last year, which also contributed to the higher network transaction volume. Runes impact subsiding At the beginning of Rune\u2019s adoption, the adoption of the latter caused an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees, but the impact of this standard is gradually reducing. The comparatively high level of gas fees for the average user is a matter of concern. However, the recent drop in transaction rates could, in fact, be a sign that things are getting better. The network shows its robustness in the face of escalating Runes activity. The former seems to validate a level of stabilization despite fluctuations. This fact reflects the fact that Bitcoin has, in the past, withstood transaction spikes and fee hikes. The situation at present depicts an equation to be solved between the increased demand for activity on the blockchain and the block\u2019s capacity to handle such tasks without a drastic increase in fee. Bitcoin miners, with profit in their sight The Rune transactions activity, which causes the overall concern for the fees at the beginning, is an opportunity for Bitcoin miners. The rise of Runes traffic as a result of its use as a transaction method can be seen as a buffer for miners, especially keeping in mind the recent Bitcoin halving event, which decreased the amount of transaction fees. This role of miners has placed them in a position to make gains from the increased demand while helping to keep the network stable. Contrastingly, Ethereum\u2019s development department recently implemented upgrades to decrease transaction fees, while Bitcoin\u2019s core development team has no plan for that. Though Bitcoin\u2019s transactions are increasing, no attempts have yet been made to reduce fees, which communicates another way from Ethereum, which is characterized by constant upgrades.","article_summary":"The transaction fees of Bitcoin have sunk onto the five-year level while still witnessing a sharp decline despite the Runes token standard boom.

Schwartz highlighted that with the look of things, XRP will move past ETH to become number 2 with a high volatility of over 1500% in the last seven years. When Schwartz replied to a user complaining about the losses she has made for 7 years during the town hall event, she stressed the fact that the earlier investments would have been worth more. Schwartz\u2019s comments are issued in the context of XRP\u2019s troubled past story, full of sharp market volatility and a legal battle, among others, representing the alleging from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of security fraud non-registration by Ripple Lab that was initiated in December 2020. Nevertheless, XRP has not only preserved its place among the top ten cryptocurrencies by the market cap but is also one of the trendiest crypto payments. Seven years ago was 4/19/2017. XRP was $.033 on 4/19/2017. That is a 1500% increase equivalent to an APY of 47%. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 20, 2024 Ripple officers, like any other, have strived to meet the regulatory requirements adopted to the ever-changing, unprecedented conditions in the digital field of currencies, thus showing a proactive attitude towards solving these problems. The firm\u2019s Director of Government Relations is actively involved in legal and regulatory debates and, therefore, his presence in the face of the community signifies the fact that Ripple\u2019s efforts not only reflect his desire to remodel the regulatory environment for Ripple but also for the entire cryptocurrency market. Ripple analyst forecasts 57,000% surge in price XRP crypto analyst Javon Marks was in the limelight for predicting an impressive 57,000% surge in Ripple\u2019s price, which could very well take it to a price level that is unimaginable by most people at the moment with numbers as high as $288. Mark has been using a full logarithmic analysis of XRP\u2019s recent performances (particularly one involving parabolic runs in the 2017-2018 market) as a basis for his most recent prediction. On the other hand, although expert opinions were positive in the near future, past performance was mostly bearish, not only in meeting the targets of the various analysts but also in meeting the goals and objectives of the organization. Others have gone on to create highly optimistic projections for XRP tokens that have not come to pass, hence caution or doubt in the investors\u2019 minds. To illustrate, if one does not understand that the prediction of $5 by April is not achieved by XRP when XRP at the highest did not surpass the $1 mark. On the contrary, Mark\u2019s predictions do not give out an impressively bullish outlook, as some people are skeptical of investing in XRP because it underperforms against the projections. ETFS vs. XRP: Which crypto reigns supreme? Whereas some XRP investors and experts are thinking rather about the latest cryptos such as \u2013 ETFSwap (ETFS) that, in their opinion, have a greater capacity for soliciting profit, others remain focused on XRP considering its performance and the strategies that its authorities will employ on its future. Such tokens that are less governed by regulatory obstacles and historical burdens, in turn, are considered to be more promising in terms of prospects by many. Because of this, their comparison to the XRP cryptocurrency, which has been around for a long time, might appear to quite some people. Investors and analysts are examining the ETFs performance, considering it is capable of providing market participants with potentially more rewards due to the fast-developing nature of the cryptocurrency world. Although XRP, the leading cryptocurrency that battles with regulatory policies and weak market prospects recorded in the past, is able to produce positive results for the investor, ETFs\u2019 maturity has been seen as an alternative offering a new approach with greater gain for investors who can absorb emerging digital assets\u2019 risks.","article_summary":"In the midst of continuously deepening discussions about XRP performance and outlook, David Schwartz, the Ripple CTO, mentioned the possibility of a long-term increase in its value.

This is not merely political identity recognition for the minds behind Bitcoin; it is primarily due to the game-changing technology in the blockchain on which this digital currency was invented. What impact did Satoshi Nakamoto have on Bitcoin? Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s ground-breaking ideas in the realm of digital have depth. Nakamoto made the way by launching Bitcoin in 2009 for the DeFi revolution that supports decentralization. The Bitcoin white paper and the initial implementation of the Bitcoin code, the first reference implementation for blockchain technology, followed one another and opened Doors to many applications of this technology. In addition to launching the new currency, his innovation effectively conceptualized trust and transactions in digital environments. Nakamoto person\u2019s real identity is still a secret as this person succeeds to remain a mysterious figure. Although the code is written by \u2018Satoshi Nakamoto,\u2019 who is a Japanese man by all inferences, the real person persists to be the cause for speculation given the fact that various experts from the software engineering field across the USA and Europe are suggested to be the ones behind the alias. It was December 2010 when Nakamoto left a community that imagined a small cryptocurrency and mentioned that it was impossible in x months. Tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto signals widespread acceptance of Crypto The Canadian Parliament\u2019s acknowledgment of bitcoin tributes shows the immeasurable leaps ahead of digital currencies in being considered a part of traditional finance. In certain cases, Bitcoin, especially, demonstrated the remarkable dislocation. It is not only that the digital coin was bought considering it a haven and a bullish asset, but it also found its substantial application in payment systems and as a shelter against money erosion. The political talk about digital currencies reflects that they are multi-faced in economic policies and the regulatory budget nowadays. The fact that the head of the Canadian government\u2019s recognition of digital currencies in an official environment, such as the Houses of Parliament, isn\u2019t merely a symbol of intellectual transformation in digital currencies but a positive step toward accepting this paradigm across the globe. This is a clear, inevitable sign that digital cryptocurrencies are increasingly important in contemporary global economics, and credit to one person is the main key to this shift. The greeting to Satoshi Nakamoto that was done on a public stage is not only a way of praising his efforts but also a signal to the other leaders to embrace technology in matters that concern government policies and economic planning.","article_summary":"A Canadian lawmaker made a groundbreaking gesture, allowing fellow lawmakers to applaud Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin.

When it surged in price as an opening salvo, there was a flurry of criticisms about it, but a placating long essay by Vitalik Buterin seems to have illuminated naysayers. WorldCoin, which has no relation to Altman\u2019s Worldcoin, experienced a significant surge between May 15 and May 17, despite no new updates from the project. Instead, the surge likely came from the latest buzz around Altman\u2019s project, leading to confusion among investors. The obscure token, launched in 2013 with a market cap of about $9 million, benefited from the success of its namesake. Altman\u2019s Worldcoin has WLD as its native token, while WorldCoin (with a capital C) has WDC as its token, so please take note.

As bystanders, let\u2019s objectively decide if we want to cash in on this trending phenomenon. How Much is Worldcoin (WLD) Worth?

In a stunning display of market performance, WLD has seen an astronomical rise of over 170% in the past week, capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts worldwide. The price of $WLD soared to $8, marking a significant 42.60% increase in just 24 hours and a 200% surge on the weekly charts. This remarkable growth has sparked widespread interest, as market watchers keenly observe the crypto landscape for what lies ahead. The surge aligns with a major milestone for the Worldcoin community, celebrating over 1 million subscribers to the World App, indicating a burgeoning adoption that could be driving the token\u2019s impressive rally.Lets take a closer look at the factors driving Worldcoin\u2019s recent surge. Milestone Achievement and Tokenomics: A Dual Force The recent achievement of the World App, Worldcoin\u2019s dedicated wallet, surpassing 1 million daily users is a testament to the project\u2019s growing appeal. This milestone, reached on February 17, 2024, has not only bolstered community morale but has also played a pivotal role in propelling the $WLD prices upwards. World App, the first wallet built for the Worldcoin project, passed 1M daily users this week. This community is incredible 🫡 pic.twitter.com/Mf6Y51gscQ \u2014 Worldcoin (@worldcoin) February 17, 2024 The tokenomics of Worldcoin reveal a total supply of 10 billion WLD coins, with a current valuation of $74.71 billion. A closer examination shows a circulating supply of 130.76 million $WLD, which constitutes about 1.31% of the total supply, highlighting the scarcity that may be contributing to the price surge. The distribution plan further allocates 75% to the Worldcoin Community, underscoring the project\u2019s commitment to its user base. Investor Confidence and Strategic Moves The investor community has shown robust confidence in Worldcoin, evidenced by the project\u2019s successful fundraising efforts, amassing $240 million across three rounds. The backing of heavyweight investors such as Blockchain Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Coinbase Ventures, among others, has lent significant credibility and financial support to the project. 5/ Fundraising#Worldcoin( $WLD) has raised a total of $240M in 3 rounds of financing.

Whale Activities and Alameda\u2019s Holdings Significant whale activities have also been a contributing factor to the recent price movements. Notably, a substantial accumulation of 2.09 million WLD by a single entity from a central exchange (CEX) triggered a 25% price pump. 5/ Fundraising#Worldcoin( $WLD) has raised a total of $240M in 3 rounds of financing.

These actions reflect the strategic plays at work within the Worldcoin ecosystem, potentially influencing the token\u2019s valuation. AI and Market Sentiments: The Underlying Momentum The enthusiasm surrounding Worldcoin is not solely based on its market performance. The project\u2019s association with AI, particularly through Sam Altman\u2019s involvement and the buzz around Sora, a text-to-video platform, has added a layer of optimism. This AI-driven excitement, coupled with bullish market sentiments ahead of significant crypto events like the Bitcoin halving, has created a favorable backdrop for $WLD\u2019s surge. The derivatives data for the WLD token, showing a significant jump in open interest, further mirrors the optimistic outlook among investors. Worldcoin Recent News Worldcoin faces intense scrutiny from regulatory authorities worldwide due to serious data privacy concerns. In Hong Kong, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) is actively investigating the company\u2019s biometric data collection practices, focusing particularly on iris scans. This probe, marked by recent raids on Worldcoin\u2019s Hong Kong offices, highlights the PCPD\u2019s commitment to enforcing data privacy laws rigorously. Simultaneously, Worldcoin has faced significant challenges in Kenya, where the company\u2019s approach to data management has drawn criticism and legal complications. A Kenyan court ruling critiqued the laxity of state agencies in handling data associated with Worldcoin, deeming the cancellation of a relevant certificate as an inadequate response to cover up negligence in data handling. This led to calls from Members of Parliament for Worldcoin to be blacklisted in Kenya Worldcoin\u2019s Controversies, Skepticism, and the Reality of Post-Launch Sign-ups Worldcoin has been the subject of controversy and skepticism due to privacy concerns. The registration process requires users to scan their iris using a device called \u201cThe Orb,\u201d which is available at specific locations globally. After human verification, users receive a \u201cWorld ID\u201d and 25 WLD, the project\u2019s native token, valued at approximately $60. The safety of \u201cThe Orb\u201d and the handling of sensitive data have been questioned, with notable individuals like Jack, the former CEO of Twitter, and Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, voicing their concerns. The project boasted an impressive 2 million sign-ups before its launch. However, the numbers post-launch tell a different story. Hong Kong, one of the cities with the highest number of sign-ups, reported about 600 sign-ups across three designated locations on the first day. Heather Huang, an operator of one of the Orbs in the city, claimed that these 600 sign-ups made up nearly half of the total Worldcoin sign-ups on launch day. If true, this suggests that only around 1,200 people signed up on launch day, a figure significantly lower than the pre-launch claims.

Worldcoin (WLD) Overview More on Worldcoin The mission of the Worldcoin project is to build the world\u2019s largest identity and financial network as a public utility, giving ownership to everyone. The Worldcoin system revolves around World ID, a privacy-preserving global identity network. World ID enables users to verify their humanness online (\u201cProof of Personhood\u201d) while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs. To engage with the Worldcoin protocol, individuals must first download World App, the first wallet app that supports the creation of a World ID. Individuals visit a physical imaging device called the Orb to get their World ID Orb verified. Most Orbs are operated by a network of independent local businesses called Orb Operators. The Orb uses multispectral sensors to verify humanness and uniqueness, with all images being promptly deleted on-device per default (absent explicit consent to Data Custody). All Orb-verified World IDs holders are entitled to claim recurring grants of free WLD tokens (WLD tokens are not available in the US; see the Worldcoin Tokenomics section of the project\u2019s whitepaper for details). This has the potential to make WLD the most widely distributed digital currency. What\u2019s WLD? The WLD token is designed as a utility token with governance properties, empowering users by giving them a say over the protocol\u2019s future. Beyond conventional \u201cone-token-one-vote\u201d governance mechanisms, the introduction of World ID paves the way for \u201cone-person-one-vote\u201d mechanisms. These two mechanisms can also be combined to enable new ways of governance. After launch, the Worldcoin Foundation will solicit proposals and work with the community on how World ID and the WLD token should interact in Worldcoin\u2019s governance model (see the project\u2019s whitepaper for details on governance and decentralization). The community of users will determine the token\u2019s utility, but a few other use cases, in addition to governance, could emerge. For example, users may use the WLD token to pay for certain actions in World App or another wallet app, make other payments, or signal their approval for certain initiatives or causes. WLD is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. Individuals will receive their user grants on Optimism Mainnet. Therefore, most WLD transactions will likely take place on the Optimism network. Who Are the Founders of Worldcoin? Worldcoin was founded by Sam Altman, Alex Blania, and Max Novendstern (Max Novendstern left the project in July 2021). The most well-known of the co-founders, Sam Altman, is also the co-founder and current CEO of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator, a startup incubator. Initial research and development for the Worldcoin project was conducted by Tools for Humanity (TFH) and other partners. Worldcoin has raised over 250M USD across several funding rounds from investors such as a16z, Khosla Ventures, Bain Capital Crypto, Blockchain Capital, and Tiger Global. What Makes Worldcoin Unique? Worldcoin aims to build the world\u2019s largest identity and financial network, achieving global adoption at a billion-people scale. In contrast to most other crypto projects, most WLD tokens will be given to individuals \u2013 simply for being human. Using World ID, individuals can prove they are a real, unique human to any platform that integrates with the protocol, including web3 systems, social networking sites, and governmental programs. This will enable fair airdrops or token/NFT sales, protection against bots/Sybil attacks on social media, and the fairer distribution of limited governmental resources. Furthermore, World ID can also enable global democratic processes and novel forms of governance (e.g., via quadratic voting), and it may eventually support a path to AI-funded UBI. Over two million people from more than 30 different countries across five continents have verified at an Orb during the pre-launch phase, which lasted from May 2021 until July 2023. At launch, Worldcoin begins the rollout of 1,500 Orbs across 35+ cities in 20+ countries to meet the global demand for World ID. How Many Worldcoin (WLD) Tokens Are There in Circulation? The initial total supply of Worldcoin is 10 billion WLD.For 15 years following the launch, the supply cap is fixed to 10B WLD (enforced by the WLD smart contract). After 15 years, governance may decide to implement an inflation rate of up to 1.5% per year if it deems it necessary for the long-term sustainability of the protocol. Governance will also decide how to allocate these newly minted tokens (if any). The WLD smart contract enforces the inflation cap of 1.5% per year. Per default, unless changed via governance, the inflation rate is set to 0%. The 10B WLD tokens are allocated to different stakeholders as follows: 75% of the WLD tokens are allocated to the Worldcoin community. 9.8% of the WLD tokens are allocated to the Initial Development Team. 13.5% of the WLD tokens are allocated to TFH Investors. 1.7% of the WLD tokens are allocated to the TFH Reserve. The Worldcoin Foundation has formulated an aspirational token allocation goal to allocate at least 60% of all WLD tokens (coming from the Worldcoin Community pool) to individuals through user grants. See the Worldcoin Tokenomics section of the project\u2019s whitepaper for details. For live on-chain data about WLD, see this Dune dashboard. How Is the Worldcoin Protocol Secured? The WLD token contract is deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, and the token is bridged to the Optimism \u201clayer 2\u201d network. It, therefore, inherits the security properties of these two blockchains. How to buy Worldcoin (WLD)? If you want to know where to buy Worldcoin at the current rate, the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in Worldcoin stock are Binance, OKX, Bitrue, Bybit, and Bitget. You can find others listed on the CMC crypto exchanges page. Conclusion The Worldcoin price prediction for the years 2024 to 2033 paints an optimistic future for this cryptocurrency. These predictions are underpinned by the impressive achievements and milestones that Worldcoin has accomplished in its relatively short existence. Worldcoin has surpassed significant user sign-up milestones, with over 1 million users by January 13, 2023, and a remarkable 2 million World ID sign-ups by July 13, 2023. The introduction of World ID and SDK in March 2023, followed by the launch of the World App in May 2023, has contributed to the project\u2019s growth and accessibility. Additionally, the successful migration to the Optimism mainnet in July 2023, along with the availability of the World ID SDK, signifies the project\u2019s commitment to technological advancements. Notably, the launch of the WLD token in July 2023 marked another significant step towards achieving its goals. Worldcoin\u2019s continued efforts to improve scalability, as demonstrated by the reduction in load on Optimism with a September 2023 World App update, and its global reach, with over 200,000 people verifying their World ID in Chile, further solidify its presence in the crypto space. The project\u2019s adaptability and innovation, such as the updated state bridges architecture and expanded World ID access in Germany, reflect its commitment to addressing challenges and enhancing user experience. With the World App surpassing 4 million downloads and offering multiple languages and local currencies, Worldcoin is positioning itself for global adoption. While regulatory scrutiny and data privacy concerns remain, Worldcoin\u2019s unique approach to identity verification and its dedication to user empowerment through token distribution set it apart. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Worldcoin\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges will play a pivotal role in its continued growth and the realization of its price potential. Investors and enthusiasts should keep a close eye on Worldcoin\u2019s developments, conduct thorough research, and exercise caution in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Price predictions are subject to change based on market dynamics and external factors, but Worldcoin\u2019s achievements and ambitions make it a project worth watching in the coming years.","article_summary":"Worldcoin Price Prediction 2024-2033 Worldcoin, spearheaded by OpenAI chief Sam Altman, launched on Monday, 24 July 2023, after years in development, promising to verify users\u2019 identity by iris-scanning and potentially solving one of the more pressing problems posed by recent advances in artificial intelligence.

SUI operates on a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless group of validators, contributing to the network\u2019s security and functionality. The native token, SUI, serves as a means of payment for gas fees. At the same time, users can stake their SUI tokens with validators in a Delegated Proof-of-Stake model, enabling active participation in consensus and potential rewards. SUI\u2019s notable feature lies in its ability to achieve parallel agreement on independent transactions, leading to enhanced scalability. While predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency is challenging, SUI\u2019s unique characteristics and growing interest suggest the potential for increased demand and value. Traders and investors are advised to stay informed about the project\u2019s developments, market trends, and factors influencing the broader cryptocurrency landscape to make well-informed decisions regarding SUI\u2019s price trajectory. Here\u2019s a bit of trivia, in case you\u2019re wondering: Sui or mizu, 水, meaning \u201cWater\u201d in Japanese, is one of the elements in the Japanese system of five elements and represents the fluid, flowing, formless things in the world. One can imagine how this coin was likewise named, but Sui can also mean many related things. The Current Price of SUI Today\u2019s Sui price is $1.38 with a 24-hour trading volume of $181,464,493. Sui is down 1.51% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is 57, with a live market cap of $1,775,428,167. It has a circulating supply of 1,295,901,469 SUI coins and a max. supply of 10,000,000,000 SUI coins. Sui Price Analysis: SUI Price Faces a Further Downtrend at $1.38 as Bearish Persists Sui price analysis shows a bearish market today. Resistance for SUI/USD is currently at $1.44. Support for the coin is present at $1.34. Sui price analysis for the 21st of April price analysis is showing a decline in the price value, as the bears have made a considerable comeback. The past few days had seen an extraordinary rise in the price as more buyers entered the market. However, Today\u2019s trend is going toward the downside, as the bears are trying to pave the way for their momentum. Sui 1-day Price Chart: Bearish Movement Has Drawn SUI Price To $1.38 The SUI/USD pair had a hard time gaining any positive momentum since the bearish wave hit the market. The price has been trying to find stability, but it is yet to be seen if the bulls can make a comeback. At present, SUI/USD faces resistance at $1.44 and support at $1.34. However, if bears break the support, there is a risk of SUI/USD falling even lower. For now, if the bulls can make some progress in pushing up the price, then $1.38 will be tested once again. SUI/USD 1-day price chart By; TradingVew The stochastic RSI is trading near undersold levels as opposed to the RSI oscillator. It is about to reach the supply zone in a daily time frame. Currently, the Stochastic RSI is trading around 45.12. The MACD also shows a bearish divergence in the SUI/USD pair, which suggests that further downward pressure could be seen in the market. The histogram\u2019s size is decreasing, which shows that the bearish momentum is still in control. The daily moving average curve is beneath the candles, which indicates that the bearish trend will remain intact shortly. Sui Price Analysis: SUI Turns Red Today as The Bears Take Over The 4-hour Sui price analysis shows that the bears are putting in efforts to achieve supremacy over the price chart once again. Their progress so far has been considerable, as the price levels have receded to the $1.38 level. If bears persist, the 20-EMA and 50-EMA might cross the bearish crossover. The current trend of the market shows that bears are making a slow recovery before furthering their downward movement. SUI/USD 4-hour price chart By; TradingView The moving average (MA) value is $1.64, slightly lower than the current price as the bearish momentum continues to dominate the market. The Stochastic RSI is trading around the oversold zone at 55.91, just below the 60 level. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also showing a bearish picture in the SUI/USD pair. The MACD line has gone below the signal line, which confirms that bears are likely to remain in control for some time. Sui Price Analysis Conclusion The Sui price analysis shows a bearish outlook in the market.

SUI Token Unique Features Sui stands out from other blockchain projects due to its unique features and architecture that address common challenges faced by earlier generations of blockchains. One of the distinguishing factors of Sui is its horizontal scaling capability. Unlike earlier blockchains that experience bottlenecks, Sui enables parallel processing of transaction groups. This approach eliminates congestion by distinguishing between various objects, resources, accounts, and components within the network. Composability is another standout feature of Sui. Unlike most blockchains, Sui allows the direct passing of assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as function arguments. Its object-centric approach also enables using more complex data structures and the ability to store assets within these structures or the assets themselves. Sui\u2019s sparse replay feature offers a practical advantage by providing a ledger of relevant transactions without the need to track unrelated interactions with decentralized applications (dApps). This optimization reduces the cost of querying on-chain data. It allows products on the Sui platform to efficiently track the evolution of objects without extensive data retrieval from the Merkle tree. On-chain storage is another distinguishing aspect of Sui. By directly storing assets as objects on the blockchain, Sui avoids the need for Merkle tree indexing. Combined with conventional means like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), this approach addresses the challenge of on-chain storage and enables cost-effective direct updates of assets on-chain. In addition to these technical features, the Sui project offers a range of initiatives and support to enhance its ecosystem. The Sui Move smart contract programming language is designed to be expressive, composable, and secure, catering to developers of all skill levels. The Sui Foundation provides educational resources, grants, and programs to foster a supportive and collaborative developer community. The project actively engages with the academic and research community to advance web3 technologies. Furthermore, the strong collaboration and support within the Sui community contribute to the growth and innovation within the decentralized technology space. SUI Token Founders Sui, the innovative blockchain project, was initially established by a team of accomplished individuals with significant experience and expertise in the crypto industry. The founders of Sui include Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias. These individuals were former executives and lead architects at Meta\u2019s Novi Research, where they played instrumental roles in developing the Diem blockchain and the Move programming language. Their collective knowledge and insights have been instrumental in shaping Sui into a groundbreaking platform with unique features and capabilities. SUI Network Security and Scalability Measures Sui ensures the security of its network through a combination of consensus algorithms and innovative technologies. Initially, at the time of launch, the default consensus algorithms used by Sui were Tusk and Narwhal. However, in August 2022, Bullshark replaced Tusk as the primary option. This change was implemented to address latency issues and to enable validators with lower processing speeds to participate actively in the project. Nevertheless, Tusk can still be utilized by updating the source code. Regarding network security, Narwhal serves as a mempool within the Sui ecosystem. It ensures that the data submitted to the consensus mechanism remains available and accessible. On the other hand, Bullshark (or Tusk) plays a crucial role in organizing the data to be read by the consensus engine. This arrangement is part of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) mempool, one of Sui\u2019s innovative features. The combination of these consensus algorithms and the DAG mempool contributes to the overall security of the Sui network. Additionally, Sui\u2019s innovative scaling solution enhances its ability to efficiently handle a high volume of transactions. The blockchain is anticipated to achieve transaction speeds exceeding 297,000 transactions per second.

As the MiCA regulation that will reshape the crypto industry approaches, crypto companies need to ensure compliance for a smooth transition. Crypto-asset market regulation (MiCA), which represents an important step by the European Union (EU) towards regulating the crypto-asset market, is one of the hot topics of 2024. MiCA seeks to infuse the market with clarity and security, addressing the needs of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and issuers while safeguarding investors. For companies operating in the crypto space, MiCA clearly calls for changes to their processes in order to adapt to the new regulatory environment. Covering topics ranging from operational flexibility to consumer protection, MiCA ensures that the crypto asset market is sustainable and compliant with wider financial market regulations. Industry stakeholders and companies need support and guidance during this transition period. This article will cover how MiCA can impact companies, focusing on processes that need attention, potential cost increases, and staffing needs. Core Requirements Under MiCA The crypto industry is on the verge of a regulatory evolution, with the draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) outlined by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). These forthcoming standards, anticipated to be presented to the European Commission by June 30, 2024, are crucial for CASPs aiming to secure a MiCA license. Essential aspects of MiCA include: Anti-Money Laundering (AML): CASPs must adhere to a comprehensive suite of laws and procedures to prevent the disguise of illicit funds as legitimate. Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT): Crypto-asset service providers are responsible for measures to prevent the flow of funds to terrorist organizations. Authorized Capital: CASPs are required to define the maximum capital they can issue, as stated in their charter. Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Crypto-asset service providers must verify customer identities and assess transactional risks. Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR): CASPs must have procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to competent authorities. Cooperation and Information Sharing: Cooperating with competent authorities and sharing necessary information is another obligation for CASPs. These foundational requirements align CASPs with broader fiscal and regulatory expectations, tailoring to their unique operational frameworks. Aligning with Wider Financial Regulations MiCA\u2019s introduction necessitates comprehensive adjustments across CASP operations, underscoring the necessity for a holistic strategy to foster a transparent, secure, and consumer-centric crypto market in sync with broader financial regulations. Key business process areas for review include: Personnel Training and Recruitment To comply with MiCA, companies need to create a team specializing in regulatory compliance specific to financial services or crypto assets. Acquiring risk management experts and legal advisors is crucial to tackling the complexities of MiCA. These professionals will be instrumental in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks and ensuring all company operations fully comply with the new regulation. CASPs should have at least one person from senior management (director) located in the country of establishment and organize activity through the place of business in the EU. Collection and Use of Personal Data MiCA mandates the protection of consumer information and the segregation of customer assets. Companies must ensure compliance with privacy and data protection by developing secure systems for collecting and using personal data. Additionally, the regulation requires implementing customer separation systems to protect customer assets, a measure aimed at improving consumer protection in the crypto market. Reporting and Accounting Companies must improve their reporting and accounting practices to meet MiCA\u2019s transparency and accountability standards. These standards include accurately reporting financial transactions and keeping company records compliant with regulatory requirements. Advisory Services for Crypto Assets Users MiCA significantly emphasizes the quality of advisory services provided to crypto asset users. Companies offering advisory services must ensure that advice is personalized, transparent, fair, and not misleading, considering the client\u2019s personal circumstances, investment objectives, and risk appetite. Crypto Exchange Services and Related Policies For companies providing crypto exchange services, MiCA seeks to ensure fair and orderly trading, set rules for order execution, and provide clear information on the exchange of crypto assets. The regulation aims to improve the integrity and stability of crypto exchange services by promoting a safer trading environment for consumers. MiCA: An Opportunity, Not a Challenge The launch of MiCA is a milestone for the cryptoasset market in the European Union and sets a precedent for regulatory frameworks worldwide. As we approach a new era of compliance and regulation, companies in the crypto sector are being given a transition period until June 2025. With the proposed changes being submitted to institutions for coordination and feedback by March 28, the regulatory changes are expected to create a more secure and reliable crypto environment. As companies seek to comply with regulations, focusing on strategic planning, investing in compliance infrastructure, and developing a knowledgeable compliance team becomes extremely important. Embracing MiCA not just as a compliance challenge but as an opportunity to increase operational integrity and consumer trust can position companies for success in the increasingly regulated global crypto market.

From AI Models on Bitcoin to AI training data on a layer 2 blockchain, coins linked to AI crypto projects are all the rage in the altcoin universe. It\u2019s a reflection of broader market conditions. Hot stock Nvidia (NVDA.O) has stolen headlines since last year and put AI on the investing map. That stock became the seventh public U.S. company valued at over $1 trillion. By March 2024, it became the world\u2019s third most valuable company after Microsoft and Apple as the market cap eclipsed $2 trillion. Investors yearn for exposure to machine learning technology at a clip that rivals the world\u2019s largest companies. AI tokens at the time of writing have a market value of $26.4 billion. Last April, that number was a mere $2.7 billion. The CoinDesk Indices Computing Index includes AI-linked tokens and has increased more than 165% in the past 12 months. And trading volumes hit an all-time high of $3.8 billion in late February. Although many investors are chasing price gains, AI-linked crypto tokens provide an opportunity in crypto that is at the same time uncorrelated to crypto. These tokens\u2019 values are arguably more tied to the fate of the AI sector than to crypto. Investment manager VanEck predicts that AI crypto revenue could reach a whopping $10.2 billion by 2030 on the low end with use cases similar to non-AI crypto projects\u2014reward tokens, physical computation infrastructure, data verification, provenance, and more. To be sure, the AI blockchain revolution remains in its infancy. How the merger of these two exciting industries plays out is unknown. Bitcoin Maximalists, for instance, believe the entire crypto index could go to zero. There is a long list of possible uses for AI tokens. Payments, trading models, machine-generated non-fungible tokens and blockchain-based marketplaces for AI applications to name a few. Theoretically, blockchain improves the security of protocols with a decentralized and immutable settlement layer. AI detects risks in real-time and provides an extra layer of security monitoring network activities, analyzing historical and provenance data and asset conditions, discovering anomalies, using predictive analytics to make smart contract conditions more efficient, and analyzing provenance data, asset conditions, and market trends. Imagine a system where these two novel technologies pull and verify data while managing network loads. Blockchain could be a public record of AI training. AI algorithms improve threat detection and response; blockchain\u2019s immutability of security-related data provides a robust defense against cyber threats paired with a decentralized approach to data management. Once the AI-verified information is recorded to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. Nonetheless, the merger of AI and blockchain poses threats. The Risks Of AI And Blockchain The United Nations General Assembly adopted March 21, a global artificial intelligence (AI) resolution promoting \u201csafe, secure, and trustworthy\u201d AI development. The European Parliament passed March 13 an AI Act to set governance standards for the Union. Additionally, the European Commission launched a probe into the use of AI. The Biden administration\u2019s October 2023 executive order notes AI development\u2019s safety and security problems. Meanwhile, India introduced AI requirements in March before the national elections. AI and blockchain, both alone and combined, pose privacy and security risks. Vast amounts of sensitive data could one day depend on the security of AI-blockchain apps, and how these might be secured remains unclear. AI requires vast amounts of data to learn, predict, and act. The data could become increasingly personal over time, posing a greater risk to privacy. Blockchain can counteract these risks by anonymizing data transactions to protect identity with methods including zero-knowledge proofs and also creating an immutable and often public record. Data recorded to a public blockchain can be deleted by nobody, presenting a conflict with privacy norms and laws such as the right to be forgotten. The theoretical potential for AI to act on data secured by blockchain without human oversight raises significant questions about consent and privacy. Fostering Beneficial Innovation In the quest to harness blockchain and AI without dystopia, the world must be guided by ethical principles and safety standards so that these technologies end up serving humanity\u2019s best interests and solving our most pressing needs. A collaborative approach among developers, ethicists, and policymakers is needed to delineate clear boundaries for AI behavior and data integrity on blockchain networks. Developers must design innovative solutions to protect privacy and security in the new digital frontier. The principles of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity ensure that AI and blockchain systems are designed with an understanding of their societal impacts.

He would also provide nonprivileged documents outlining his investments in the AI company Anthropic and an affidavit proving his negative net worth. In exchange for Bankman-Fried\u2019s cooperation, plaintiffs would drop current and future claims against him. Bloomberg said that plaintiffs acknowledged Bankman-Fried\u2019s participation as \u201cvaluable\u201d but recognized that the shift in focus could make their case\u2019s outcome uncertain. The judge must decide whether to approve the proposal. Past developments The relevant case, currently proceeding in the Southern District of Florida, brings together several civil lawsuits against various FTX promoters and insiders. Several other defendants previously approached a settlement. A March 27 filing named FTX insiders Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, former FTX lawyer Daniel Friedberg, several internet personalities, and AFL quarterback William Trevor Lawrence as proposed settling defendants. The current status of the proposal is unclear. Much earlier, in April 2023, some celebrity promoters \u2014 including but not limited to Brady and Bundchen \u2014 asked the court to dismiss claims. The relevant case, Garrison v. Bankman-Fried et al., became part of the consolidated case by June 2023. All civil cases are distinct from the high-profile criminal case against Bankman-Fried, which has concluded. Bankman-Fried was convicted on criminal charges in November 2023 and received a 24-year prison sentence in March.

Ji Kim, Chief Legal and Policy officer at the Crypto Council for Innovation, wrote that the IRS\u2019 approach is \u201cunfortunate\u201d as it does not recognize that unhosted wallet providers lack knowledge about crypto transactions and the parties involved in each transaction. Shehan Chandrasekera, Head of Tax at CoinTracker, similarly criticized the form. He argued the effects could spill over to end users, who may need to engage in KYC verification when they create unhosted wallets or use unhosted wallets with services such as DeFi platforms. However, Chandrasekera said that authorities will likely aim their enforcement efforts at unhosted wallet providers instead of end users. Unhosted or non-custodial wallets do not store crypto balances with a third-party service. They are distinct from custodial wallets, a category that includes most exchange wallets. Form 1099-DA Form 1099-DA also asks brokers to provide certain on-chain data, including transaction IDs and wallet addresses related to each sale. Brokers should report the transaction ID and address originating the sold crypto \u2014 and a secondary address if they \u201ctransferred in\u201d the funds from another of their hosted wallet addresses. Experts responded to the requirement differently. Chandrasekera warned that collecting and reporting data, especially wallet addresses, \u201ccould lead to major privacy and security concerns.\u201d However, Ledgible\u2019s VP of Tax Information Reporting, Jessalyn Dean, noted an exception to the rule. She said the form allows brokers not to provide addresses and transaction IDs if not applicable. She called the exception \u201cnecessary\u201d because brokers often perform transactions in their internal recordkeeping systems rather than on-chain. Another critical section reads, \u201cWash sale loss disallowed.\u201d According to Dean, this does not bring crypto under wash sale rules. Instead, the section applies to digital assets currently subject to wash sale rules, such as stock, securities, and tokenized equities. Rules not yet finalized Crypto brokerage reporting rules have been in the making for some time. President Joe Biden\u2019s Infrastructure Act in 2021 categorized certain crypto services as brokers in 2021. In August 2023, the Treasury and the IRS published a proposal for 1099-DA that largely resembles the contents of today\u2019s draft form. However, the draft form\u2019s text indicates that the IRS has not finalized the form and that brokers should not use it in their current tax reports. According to Ledgible, there is a 60-day comment period on the form. The IRS has established separate rules for individual crypto investors. The regulator published a reminder on April 11 that crypto investors should report on various forms, including Form 1040. A top IRS member also recently warned of tax avoidance among crypto investors.

In an April 19 statement, the Hong Kong-based crypto trading platform stated that it would restrict deposits from Binance starting May 10 and end support for virtual asset withdrawals to Binance-hosted wallet addresses by May 17. However, transactions involving virtual assets to whitelisted unhosted wallet addresses will remain unaffected. These addresses are verified and authenticated by the exchange. HashKey attributed its decision to \u201ca change in its policy\u201d but did not provide additional details about the new rules. In December 2023, HashKey terminated support for crypto deposits from all third-party exchanges except Binance. At the time, the exchange announced it would only accept deposits exceeding 8,000 HKD from Binance, subject to specific guidelines. HashKey Exchange is one of the few licensed exchanges in Hong Kong and caters to both institutional and retail investors. Binance regulatory woes HashKey\u2019s decision further compounds Binance\u2019s woes across various legal jurisdictions. Last month, an entity linked to the Richard Teng-crypto trading platform in Hong Kong, HKVAEX, abruptly closed operations and withdrew its application for licensing. Amid the drama, the Nigerian authorities detained two executives from the platform and accused the exchange of exacerbating its foreign exchange challenges.

Hougan raised critical questions about the limitations of EMH in anticipating what the market will be like post-halving. He pointed out that while EMH suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s current price reflects all available information, including the anticipated supply cut from the halving \u2014 it does not account for unexpected shifts in market demand. Hougan said: \u201cThe halving is well known, so today\u2019s price reflects that it will occur\u2026 [but] what if future demand for bitcoin is higher than the market currently anticipates?\u201d The Bitwise CIO added that the market might have already priced in the direct effects of the halving, but the hypothesis cannot anticipate the level of future demand. Hougan referenced Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller\u2019s work, which highlights the discrepancies between EMH predictions and actual market behavior, to support his arguments. Shiller\u2019s research suggests that while EMH may be applicable on a micro-scale to individual stocks, broader market trends can defy these predictions. Forced vs. willing sellers Hougan also delved into the dynamic between \u201cforced\u201d and \u201cwilling\u201d sellers within the Bitcoin ecosystem. He explained that miners, who face high operational costs, are primarily forced sellers and will see their contributions to market supply drop significantly post-halving. This reduction shifts the market trend toward willing sellers, who have to be compelled to let go of their Bitcoin by offering higher prices. Willing sellers mostly comprise long-term holders. He argued that this shift could create \u201csignificant upward price pressure\u201d if the market has indeed underestimated future demand, suggesting a bullish outcome as increased demand meets a limited supply. As the bitcoin community and investors around the globe prepare for the halving, Hougan\u2019s critical analysis provides a thought-provoking perspective on how traditional economic theories like the EMH apply to the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto markets. His insights suggest that investors should consider potential deviations from established market predictions, underscoring the complexities and uncertainties that come with crypto investments.

The token price surged by a significant 6.20%, indicating a shift in investor sentiment towards optimism. This bullish momentum is further bolstered by analyst predictions and market psychology. TIA\u2019s price action reveals a struggle between bullish and bearish forces. While the Fear & Greed Index sits at 72 (\u201cGreed\u201d) and price predictions lean bullish, the current price of $11.70 remains significantly lower than its February 10th, 2024 ATH of $20.85.

While these targets are lofty, they highlight the analyst\u2019s belief in Celestia\u2019s long-term potential. Celestia\u2019s Underlying Value Proposition The recent bullish sentiment surrounding Celestia isn\u2019t solely driven by speculation. Celestia is a modular data availability network, a foundational technology that underpins the scalability and security of blockchains. By offering a secure platform for developers to launch their own blockchains, Celestia positions itself as a crucial piece of infrastructure in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. This underlying value proposition, coupled with the recent positive market forces, is propelling Celestia into the spotlight. Will TIA Reach $130? While predicting specific price points like $130 is inherently difficult in the volatile cryptocurrency market, Celestia\u2019s future trajectory remains intriguing. Bullish sentiment and a Greed market mood suggest potential for price appreciation.

Section 702, originally introduced as a counterterrorism measure, grants the US government broad authority to collect data from various sources, including tech giants like Google and Facebook, without the need for a warrant. Despite opposition from civil liberties groups and some senators, the bill passed with a landslide vote of 60-34, setting the stage for its extension for an additional two years pending US President Joe Biden\u2019s signature. This is bad. Crypto is not just about trading tokens, it\u2019s part of a broader ethos of protecting freedom and privacy and keeping power in the hands of the little guy. And these values unfortunately continue to be under attack, globally. https://t.co/iFM932IBP6 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 20, 2024 Crypto Industry Braces For Impact Amidst the renewed debate over privacy and government surveillance, the crypto industry finds itself at the forefront of the conversation. With its emphasis on decentralization and anonymity, the industry is particularly vulnerable to the expanded powers granted by Section 702. Civil liberties activists have long argued that Section 702\u2019s broad powers are ripe for abuse and could lead to the indiscriminate collection of data on US citizens. Senator Ron Wyden has labeled it as one of history\u2019s most dramatic expansions of government surveillance authority, sparking fears over the erosion of privacy rights. NEWS: Wyden Statement on Reauthorization of FISA 702 Without Reforms to Warrantless Surveillance of Americans https://t.co/ywCNELcpuV \u2014 WydenPress (@WydenPress) April 20, 2024 Regulatory Crackdowns Loom Large The renewal of Section 702 raises the specter of increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements for crypto businesses. Entities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) could intensify their crackdowns on businesses, including decentralized exchanges, to ensure compliance with surveillance and data collection requirements. Contrasting Perspectives While some senators, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, advocate for surveillance measures targeting users within the crypto industry, others express skepticism over the potential implications for privacy and civil liberties. The revelation of improper searches by government agencies, including the FBI, further underscores the need for robust oversight and accountability measures. Collaboration And Controversy In The Crypto Sphere Despite the concerns surrounding government surveillance, there are also instances of collaboration between crypto companies and law enforcement agencies in combating illicit activities. Tether CEO\u2019s disclosure of collaboration with the FBI and the Secret Service to combat terror funding highlights the complex relationship between the crypto industry and regulatory authorities. As the debate over Section 702 continues to unfold, the crypto industry finds itself at a crossroads.

As the biggest crypto asset, the price of most altcoins are largely correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s, making the halving event very important to all investors. According to Matt Hougan, CIO of crypto index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management, the just concluded Bitcoin halving presents a buying opportunity for crypto investors. Is Bitcoin Halving A \u2018Buy The News\u2019 Opportunity? Bitcoin halving events are highly anticipated in the crypto world. While speaking in an interview with CNBC Squawk Box, Hougan noted that Bitcoin prices will rally substantially after the halving, making it a \u201cbuy the news\u201d event, especially when looking at the long term. Hougan went ahead to analyze Bitcoin\u2019s price action in the months after the halving, noting how the asset\u2019s price rallied substantially in the year after the last three halvings. Hougan credits this price increase to the supply crunch in the months after the halvings. \u201cThe amount of new supply of Bitcoin coming into the market is being cut in half. We\u2019re removing $11 billion of annual supply. I think big picture, that has to be good for price and that\u2019s what I would expect over the next year,\u201d Hougan said. When asked about the potential of Bitcoin being used as a store of value amidst geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, Hougan noted the crypto\u2019s ability is best seen in the big picture. \u201cIf you look big picture, its done a great job of protecting us against inflation post-COVID. I think eventually it will be a good hedge against geopolitical disruptions,\u201d Hougan said. What\u2019s Next For Bitcoin? The recently concluded Bitcoin halving saw the rewards given to miners slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The idea and design behind each halving are pretty simple. With fewer new bitcoins entering circulation, existing bitcoins could become more valuable. In each of the three previous halvings, the price of bitcoin fluctuated in the first few months, but it ended up being much higher one year later For example, the price of Bitcoin lingered for at least nine months after the 2020 halving before finally going on a 458% price surge. If history were to repeat itself, a similar 450% surge would put the price of Bitcoin around $345,000 in the first quarter of 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,870. Bitcoin is currently up by over 130% in the yearly timeframe leading up to the just concluded halving. A similar 130% surge in a yearly timeframe after the halving puts the price of Bitcoin around $150,000 by mid-2025. Interestingly, this price range sits better with Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, who predicted the BTC price would reach at least $170,000 by the end of the current market cycle.

This strategy forms part of FTX\u2019s liquidation process initiated after its collapse in November 2022. The upcoming auction, which diverges from previous fixed-price sales, is a strategic shift signaling potential changes in market dynamics. Will the Crypto Community Participate in the Solana Auction? Previously, between 25 million and 30 million SOL tokens were sold, netting nearly $1.9 billion. These were priced at $64 each, a sharp 60% discount from the market price then. However, the discount came with a trade-off, i.e., the buyers had to lock their SOL for four years. \u201cBasically you\u2019re exchanging time for a discount \u2014 you have to lock up your capital for four years, but you get to pay much less for the tokens,\u201d Eva Weng, from Caladan, said.

The auction format might escalate bidding fervor, with a probability of implications on Solana\u2019s pricing trends. Currently, Solana\u2019s price trajectory is on a possible upturn. After reaching a high of $210 on March 18, the Solana price dropped significantly by over 44%, hitting a low of around $116 on April 13. Nevertheless, it has rebounded, trading nearly 30% higher from that low. This recovery is crucial as Solana tests major resistance levels near $156.

This new development enhances the functionality of Bitcoin by enabling the creation of fungible tokens. It also significantly boosts transaction fees and miner revenue, reshaping the economic landscape of the network. Altcoins on Bitcoin Mark a New Milestone Lucas Outumuro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, recently highlighted the seismic impact of Runes, describing it as \u201cabsolutely insane.\u201d He pointed to the surge in daily fees which reached a record $80 million. This is about four times higher than the previous all-time high set in December 2017. Furthermore, the average Bitcoin transaction fee has skyrocketed to $128, a figure that starkly overshadows the $30 peak during the initial frenzy over Ordinals. This surge in fees has been a boon for miners, who despite a 50% drop in inflationary rewards due to the halving, saw their earnings spike by 1,200% following the Runes launch. The sudden spike lead to a record $100 million in Bitcoin mining revenue. Bitcoin Transaction Fees.

According to Outumuro, this indicates that the current surge is driven predominantly by seasoned crypto enthusiasts, with retail investors yet to join the fray. The traditional finance sector, particularly Wall Street, was caught off guard by these developments.

Gox\u2019s official website was amended to include crypto payment options. Mt. Gox\u2019s Bitcoin Payout The recent update has sparked mixed reactions among creditors. While some remain skeptical, others speculate that the crypto exchange might initiate repayments sooner than expected, potentially concluding before October 31, 2024. The repayment plan entails distributing 142,000 Bitcoin (BTC), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and 69 billion Yen to creditors. If the repayment plan proceeds as anticipated, industry analysts anticipate significant selling pressure in October as creditors liquidate their assets. This anticipation stems from the prolonged wait of Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors, spanning nearly a decade since the exchange\u2019s collapse. Notably, progress on the repayment front has been observed, particularly with bank account reimbursements. Reports emerged in late December 2023 regarding the first Mt.

The halving, which is the completion of a pre-coded Bitcoin software update, occurs every four years as that is the time it takes to mine 210,000 blocks in the network. Mechanics of Bitcoin Halving According to the report, this year\u2019s halving, the fourth in the series appears to be from the crypto mining pool ViaBTC with an additional 37.6256 BTC ($2,401,399) \u201creward paid as fees of the 3,050 transactions which were included in the block\u201d. The previous three halving events occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020. With the halving completed, the first major implication is the reduction in the mining reward by 50%. This adjustment, preordained by the code governing Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, aims to maintain a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin units and prevent inflation in the digital currency. The first Bitcoin halving in 2012 rewarded miners with 50 BTC for mining a block and that constant reduction means miners will now earn 3.125 BTC per each mined block. This reduction mechanism is a constant programmed by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous founder. Although Bitcoin advocates view the halving as a positive catalyst for the market as it will reduce the supply of new tokens amid rising demand, analysts have suggested that the event was largely priced into the market. Despite the potential bullish impact on the market, macroeconomic factors such as signals from the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions may temper short-term bullishness toward Bitcoin. Impact of Bitcoin Halving Event 2024 The halving event is set to have a significant financial impact on Bitcoin mining companies, potentially wiping out billions of dollars in annual revenue. Ahead of this year\u2019s halving, analysts at American investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM), highlighted challenges for miners to include production cost, decline in income, and electricity concerns. Before the halving, several mining companies scouted for sustainable mining options with a Texas-based Bitcoin mining firm Giga Energy partnering with Argentinian Firms. As the sector braces for consolidation, publicly-listed Bitcoin miners are expected to gain market share, leveraging greater access to funding and equity financing. Past halving events have been completed without disrupting the functioning of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners will now rely increasingly on transaction fees as a source of revenue amidst dwindling rewards. There are 64 expected halving events before reaching the 21 million cap around 2140 when all Bitcoin blocks would be mined. Meanwhile, the price trajectory of Bitcoin has remained little unchained despite speculations and projections by different analysts before the halving. For instance, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley predicted the digital asset\u2019s surge to $100,000 after the halving event. However, market watchers say it is still too early but a bullish run is anticipated in the coming days. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is pegged at $63,665.87, down by 1.61% in the past 24 hours. next Bitcoin Halving 2024: Implications for Miners and Market Dynamics","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Bitcoin Halving 2024: Implications for Miners and Market Dynamics The price trajectory of Bitcoin has remained little unchained despite speculations and projections by different analysts before the halving.

At the Token2049 crypto event in Dubai, Tether\u2019s CEO Paolo Ardoino unveiled plans to launch both the US dollar-pegged USDT and the gold-backed Tether Gold (XAUT) stablecoins on the TON network. Ardonio emphasized the impact of the expansion to the blockchain network; he revealed that the launch of USDT and XAUT on TON is expected to facilitate seamless value transfers and enhance liquidity within the ecosystem. By leveraging the blockchain, users can anticipate an experience comparable to traditional financial systems, while benefiting from the advantages of decentralized cryptocurrency infrastructure. Tether\u2019s CEO further explained that expanding USDT and XAUT on The Open Network will help in the improvement of decentralized applications across different sectors, ultimately enhancing the functionality and utility of the TON ecosystem. It will also boost usage and seamless transaction between its telegram users. According to the announcement, the USDT stablecoin will go live on the blockchain on April 20th, marking a milestone in Tether\u2019s expansion strategy. The XAUT stablecoin will follow suit, although a specific launch date was not provided. This development represents growth for XAUT, as it will now be available on a second blockchain network, extending its reach beyond Ethereum. The decision to integrate USDT and XAUT on the TON blockchain not only signifies an important step for Tether but also bolsters TON\u2019s standing within the cryptocurrency market. Recently, its native cryptocurrency, Toncoin, surpassed the popular meme-coin Dogecoin in market capitalization, solidifying its position as a significant player in the crypto space. Toncoin Trading Volumes and Price Surge after Announcement The integration of Tether\u2019s stablecoins on TON promises to deliver a more streamlined financial experience for traders and investors within its ecosystem. This development has already had an impact on the market performance of Toncoin, with the announcement triggering a surge in trading volume and price appreciation. In the hours following the news, Toncoin\u2019s trading volume skyrocketed by 125%, while its price experienced a 30% increase. This uptick in trading activity and price appreciation reflects the confidence and optimism of traders and investors in the potential of the TON ecosystem, buoyed by the integration of Tether\u2019s stablecoins. Moreover, Toncoin has risen to rank 8th in market capitalization, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market. The growth of the coin\u2019s popularity and market performance has been further reinforced by a recent announcement from Telegram.

According to a notice to investors, starting from May 10, the exchange will discontinue accepting deposits from crypto wallets belonging to Binance or whitelisted on the platform, while withdrawals will be suspended on May 17. A Change in Policy The Hong Kong-based company cited a \u201cpolicy change\u201d for suspending deposits and withdrawals from all Binance\u2019s known wallet addresses. The company did not provide details of the policy change. \u201cDue to a change in our policy, from May 10, 2024, 00:00 UTC+8, HashKey Exchange will cease to allow any VA deposits from Binance-hosted wallet address(es), and from May 17, 2024, 00:00 UTC+8, HashKey Exchange will cease to allow any VA withdrawals to Binance hosted wallet address(es,\u201d wrote the company. Despite the lack of specific details surrounding the policy change, HashKey assures users that the change only affects transactions involving Binance wallets. Users with other types of addresses can still deposit and withdraw funds from the exchange without restrictions. Expansion and Strategic Alliances Beyond these operational adjustments, HashKey has been making notable strides within the industry after obtaining regulatory approval from the Hong Kong financial regulator to offer services to retail investors in the country. Earlier this week, the company announced the launch of a global digital assets trading platform for users outside Hong Kong. The newly launched exchange, HashKey Global, debuted in Bermuda after securing an operational license in the country. For now, the company will only support spot trading of 21 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. In the future, HashKey plans to add support for future contracts and other types of trading to the platform. Additionally, the crypto exchange will integrate staking features.

In an interview, Teng noted that \u201cthis year\u2019s halving is unique in that it comes amid a series of other significant events in the Bitcoin and wider crypto ecosystem.\u201d ETF Breakthroughs Fuel Institutional Interest Some of the significant events referenced by Teng include the fact that this year\u2019s halving is taking place after the recorded breakthrough in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has catalyzed institutional interest and participation in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, the Binance CEO referenced the growing activity in Layer 2 solutions and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications on the Bitcoin network. These are fueled by innovations like the Ordinals protocol and Bitcoin inscriptions. Commenting on the expected price trajectory, Teng said historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price has tended to increase in the six months following each halving event. He attributes this trend to the reduction in the supply of new coins resulting from the halving, which creates upward pressure on prices. To solidify this position, a recent Bybit report predicts Bitcoin supply scarcity after halving which may affect the price. The Binance boss, however, cautioned that the extent of future growth will depend on various factors, including overall market sentiment and rates of adoption. This implies that investors must exercise caution given the volatility of the market. The recent approvals of Bitcoin ETFs have already stimulated demand for BTC to expand its reach among investors. Teng believes that although these developments paint an optimistic picture for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, it\u2019s crucial for investors, especially newcomers, to manage their expectations. Bitcoin Halving 2024: Teng Urges Managed Expectations He advises against expecting immediate price shifts in response to the halving, emphasizing that its true impact will be reflected in longer-term trends relative to value, liquidity, adoption, and the acceptance of crypto as an asset class. Teng\u2019s advice is consistent with the position of analysts on the Bitcoin price which had a massive run-up ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving some hours away. After a massive 50% and more rally so far in 2024, analysts have advised caution to investors building fresh positions. As Bitcoin halving 2024 inches closer, the rewards per block will decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for the next four years. This decrease will impact the mining difficulty, which is a measure of how hard it is for miners to solve complex puzzles and find a hash lower than the target set by the system in the Proof of Work (PoW) system. Some analysts see the halving event as Bitcoin\u2019s protocol deflationary monetary policy, contributing to its labeling as digital gold and a hedge against inflation. next Richard Teng Considers His First Bitcoin Halving as Binance CEO \u2018Unique\u2019 Event","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Richard Teng Considers His First Bitcoin Halving as Binance CEO \u2018Unique\u2019 Event Richard Teng cautioned that the extent of future growth will depend on various factors, including overall market sentiment and rates of adoption.

The MERL token holders will have the ability to shape the future of the Merlin project through governance. The MERL token holders can also stake their bag to earn more rewards simultaneously ensuring the network performs well through enhanced security. The MERL token can also facilitate the payment of transaction fees within the layer three enhancements. \u201cCommunity members may support network operations through collator delegation or operate their collators by utilizing MERL tokens. Furthermore, MERL serves as native liquidity and collateral, enabling seamless transactions and robust lending mechanisms within the ecosystem,\u201d the Merlin Chain team noted. Closer Look at Merlin Market Outlook and $MERL\u2019s Tokenomics The Bitcoin network previously faced existential threats from the fast-growing layer one (L1) chains such as Ethereum (ETH). According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin network now has more than $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL) from crucial Web3 projects including DEXes, farming protocols, lending, and cross-chain infrastructure, among others. The Merlin chain plays a crucial role in ensuring the Bitcoin network remains at the helm of the digital assets industry. Furthermore, the Merlin Chain has more than $904 million in TVL from its web3 projects led by MerlinSwap, Mage Finance, and Surg Protocol, among others. According to the Merlin chain team, the introduction of the MERL token is a pivotal milestone in enabling ecosystem development. Notably, the MERL tokens have a total supply of 2.1 billion and are meticulously crafted to empower the community.

Nickel Digital Asset Management registered its best-ever quarterly performance for its $80 million Diversified Alpha fund. This fund from Nickel aims to exploit market pricing inefficiencies. As per Nickel, this fund typically provides returns in the range of 15-20% annually, said Chief Executive Officer Anatoly Crachilov. However, amid strong market undercurrent in the first quarter, the Diversified Alpha fund provided a staggering 11% return. Amid a strong mix of trading volumes, market volatility, and \u201chigh dispersion\u201d, Nickel\u2019s Diversified Alpha fund returned 5% during the month of March, explained the crypto fund in a recent presentation. However, Nickel in its presentation stated that these are one-of-its-kind returns and investors shouldn\u2019t expect these conditions to last forever. It also noted that the high risk in the fund could lead to greater-than-expected drawdowns. During the presentation, David Fauchier, Diversified Alpha\u2019s manager, said: \u201cUnfortunately, this is not a new normal, we won\u2019t make 5% every month going forwards. Everything you could want in a quarter pretty much happened at some point during that quarter.\u201d Crypto Funds Outperformed During Q1 Nickel isn\u2019t the sole crypto manager enjoying a prosperous quarter; funds managed by Brevan Howard and Pantera Capital have also capitalized on the bullish market to achieve substantial gains. During the period, Bitcoin surged by 67%, surpassing the performance of most traditional asset classes, while the broader Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index recorded a notable 57% increase. Despite the widespread success seen across many crypto hedge funds, Diversified Alpha\u2019s exceptional performance has raised some concerns, as noted by Nickel. In an interview, Michael Hall, Nickel Digital\u2019s chief investment officer, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overstep expectations. We want to let them know that they can have negative months as well. That\u2019s just being honest and straightforward.\u201d On the other hand, crypto investment products have continued to see strong inflows amid the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. This new Bitcoin investment product has registered more than $12.26 billion in net inflows so far. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event will lead to a major supply squeeze.

This integration, expected by June\u2019s conclusion in 2024, could potentially strengthen PayPal\u2019s fledgling cryptocurrency endeavor, marking a pivotal move amidst the ongoing battle for stablecoin supremacy. Backed by Peak XV Partners, Triple-A witnessed remarkable growth after securing its license from Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority (MAS) in 2021.

Now, Triple-A aims to double those impressive figures again by the end of this year, Triple-A Embraces PYUSD for Broader Appeal Triple-A\u2019s decision to include PYUSD reflects a strategic shift towards a more diverse crypto ecosystem. Currently, the company mainly deals with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and established stablecoins like USDT accounting for 60% of their volume. By adding PYUSD, Triple-A intends to access a potentially huge user base. Eric Barbier, Triple-A\u2019s founder and CEO, highlights PayPal\u2019s vast user network. Integrating PYUSD could significantly boost its circulation, which currently sits at a modest $200 million, compared to USDT\u2019s staggering $110 billion market capitalization. \u201cPayPal has the firepower to make it available to a lot consumers at one go. Nobody has this power today,\u201d said Barbier. PayPal\u2019s launch of its stablecoin, PYUSD, marked a significant step for major financial institutions. However, PYUSD faces stiff competition from well-established players. Tether\u2019s USDT holds a dominant market share, and its proven track record inspires greater trust among users. Making things complicating for PYUSD is the ongoing regulatory scrutiny by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In November 2023, PayPal received a subpoena requesting documents linked to the PYUSD project, creating uncertainty among PayPal\u2019s potential users to adopt its new stablecoin.

However, Triple-A\u2019s integration of the stablecoin signifies a pivotal advancement for PayPal\u2019s aspirations within the crypto domain.

Durov Explains Tokenization of Stickers on Telegram Durov spoke earlier today at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, highlighting Telegram\u2019s affinity with decentralization and blockchain technology. According to Durov, Telegram is the first social media platform to tokenize usernames and anonymous numbers, a feature that has now generated $350 million in sales and pays owners 95% of the revenue generated. Telegram already began auctioning usernames in 2022, with unique usernames like casino.ton selling for more than $200,000. The Telegram founder mentioned that people who have bought and resold some of these usernames have been able to 33x the prices of these names. However, to the Telegram team, there is room for more. Pavel Durov said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stay there. We want to go further. You see, we believe in socially-relevant NFTs. We believe in NFTs that are deeply integrated into human culture, into human interaction, into our communication. NFTs that you can see tens of billions of times and\u2026 have a lot of potential [to] spread virally. These are the right NFTs. That\u2019s why the next step that we are going to undertake is tokenizing Telegram stickers.\u201d To buttress his point, Durov displayed a sticker of a smoking duck, created a few years ago by a sticker artist working with Telegram. The CEO pointed out that since it was created, the sticker has become a viral meme and a cultural phenomenon even outside of Telegram, now with hundreds of millions of views at least. \u201cImagine someone owned this as an NFT when it first came out a few years ago. I think the price increase will challenge what we have experienced with anonymous numbers,\u201d Durov said. Explaining the reason for the development, Durov says that stickers are very popular and shared more than 700 billion times monthly on Telegram. Telegram Emoji Meme Coins Interestingly Telegram wants to take all of these even further by tokenizing emojis as well. Durov also hinted that after this is successful, Telegram may decide to tokenize sticker sets and emoji sets so that they become meme coins. Durov\u2019s entire speech considerably dialed on blockchain technology, specifically The Open Network (TON). He mentioned that all of the tokenization of stickers and emojis will happen on the TON blockchain because it is highly scalable. \u201cAt our scale, we need something that can process tens of millions, potentially hundreds of millions of transactions,\u201d said he. The CEO said that to properly offer services where there are millions of stickers and emojis tokenized, the blockchain should be able to handle the volume. In addition to tokenizing stickers and emojis, Durov spoke on Telegram\u2019s model of harnessing the blockchain, highlighting the decentralization users, channels, and content creators currently enjoy. For instance, Telegram launched ad revenue sharing, where channels get 50% of all revenue, with payments and withdrawals powered by TON. He also said Telegram will introduce a new Tips for Creators revenue sharing model, where creators will receive 70% of all revenue.next Telegram to Tokenize Stickers and Emojis as NFTs and Meme Coins on TON Blockchain, Says CEO Durov","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Telegram to Tokenize Stickers and Emojis as NFTs and Meme Coins on TON Blockchain, Says CEO Durov Speaking at the Token2049 event in Dubai, CEO Pavel Durov says that Telegram intends to enable tokenization of stickers and emojis as NFTs.

Martha","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether ETF Approval to Challenge China\u2019s Crypto Restrictions The recent approvals of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs in Hong Kong are poised to challenge the Chinese restrictions on trading digital assets in the country. According to a DL News report on Friday, citing an interview with Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and chief executive of Hex Trust, a crypto custodian company, the recent introduction of the crypto ETFs in the Hong Kong market could indirectly expose Chinese investors to the digital asset space. China ETFs Law Not Clear Recall that in 2021, China banned all crypto-related activities, including trading, staking, and mining. However, Quaglini believes that with digital asset ETFs coming to the Hong Kong market, investors in mainland China could be granted the opportunity to explore the new investment products. The Hex Trust co-founder said this could be possible because the law regarding ETFs in mainland China remains unclear. He is optimistic that the region\u2019s interest in alternative assets like gold could suggest a potential appetite for crypto. He further stated that allowing investors in mainland China to invest in the crypto ETFs could bring billions of dollars into the industry if the digital assets stance in China does not apply to ETFs. China Unlikely to Allow Investors to Trade ETFs Despite Quaglini\u2019s optimism that China\u2019s crypto restrictions will not extend to ETFs, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X (Twitter) that it is highly unlikely to happen. Agree.. if Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn't crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on bitcoin will incl the ETFs and they DEF won't be on the southbound connect program. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 15, 2024 He also warned investors not to expect massive inflows to the newly approved financial products like that of the United States because Hong Kong\u2019s ETF market is small and will be considered lucky to even get up to $500 million. \u201cDon\u2019t expect a lot of flows (I saw one estimate of $25b that\u2019s insane). We think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m. Here\u2019s why: 1. The HK ETF market is tiny, only $50b, and Chinese locals cannot buy these, at least officially,\u201d he wrote on X. He also stated that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has yet to approve an ETF for a prominent company like BlackRock, which could affect the expected inflow. Chinese Investors Still Have Access to Crypto China used to have a vibrant crypto market and was a preferred location for miners due to the country\u2019s low electricity costs. However, the tables turned when the country\u2019s financial authorities enacted the law to ban crypto, and the companies fled to neighboring nations for safety, with some even going to the United States. Despite the ban, investors across the country still need to find a way to access the crypto economy. According to a report from Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, crypto transactions emanating from the Chinese market reached $86.4 billion between July 2022 and June 2023.next Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether ETF Approval to Challenge China\u2019s Crypto Restrictions","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether ETF Approval to Challenge China\u2019s Crypto Restrictions Despite some optimism that China's crypto restrictions will not extend to ETFs, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that it is highly unlikely to happen.

The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $21 billion and a daily average trading volume of approximately $562 million, rebounded around 4 per in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.46 on Friday. Despite the 20 percent drop in the past seven days, ADA price is already in the early stages of a macro bull run. Furthermore, ADA price successfully broke out of a macro falling trend after establishing a bear market bottom of around 24 cents last year. Ali Martinez\u2019s Take on Cardano (ADA) Price Action Having completed a mid-term correction in the past few weeks, ADA\u2019s price is ready to rally to a fresh multi-year high in the coming months. According to a popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, ADA price is on the precipice of a 75 percent rally based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator. The crypto analyst opined that the ADA\u2019s MVRV ratio dipped below -22 percent again following the recent correction. Notably, the last time the ADA\u2019s MVRV dipped below -22 percent, the altcoin rallied more than 75 percent in the subsequent days. The last time #Cardano's MVRV Ratio dipped below -22%, $ADA's price soared by over 75%. With the #ADA MVRV Ratio back under -22%, we could see another impressive rebound! pic.twitter.com/ABf0mp4pR4 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2024 From a technical standpoint, ADA price rebounded on the weekly 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement, thus indicating the ABC correction is over. As the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) attempts to rebound above the 50 level, it will be crucial for the bulls to defend the megaphone border as a support level. Previously, Martinez had noted that ADA price action is closely following the 2018 to 2021 cycle. As the Cardano whales continue to accumulate more coins regardless of the market volatility, Martinez is confident the ADA price will reach $1.7 soon. Nothing has really changed for #Cardano. $ADA is exactly where it should be, consolidating in the $0.55 to $0.80 range before a breakout to $1.70! https://t.co/414rFQhxLf pic.twitter.com/Djx9YqOp7F \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2024 State of Web3 Space in Cardano Ecosystem As Coinspeaker reported, the Cardano web3 ecosystem has significantly grown since the core developers led by Charles Hoskinson introduced smart contracts through the Alonzo Hard Fork in 2021. According to the latest market data provided by defillama, the Cardano network has a total value locked (TVL) of about $307 million and a stablecoins market cap of around $20 million. Currently, the Cardano core developers are working on scaling its network to compete with other emerging layer one (L1) chains such as Solana (SOL), BSC, Tron (TRX), Toncoin (TON), and Avalanche (AVAX), among others.

As a result, numerous staking platforms have emerged, offering various features and benefits to users. In this article, we will be highlighting the top 10 crypto staking platforms of 2024 based on factors such as reputation, security, staking rewards, and overall user experience. Through this list, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the leading platforms in the rapidly growing field of crypto staking. What is Crypto Staking? Crypto staking is a process where users lock up their cryptocurrency assets in order to validate transactions on a blockchain network and earn rewards for doing so. This method of earning income from crypto assets has gained popularity due to its relatively low risk compared to other forms of investments, such as Proof-of-Work mining. Staking essentially involves contributing to the security and stability of a blockchain network, and in return, the user receives a portion of the transaction fees or newly created coins as a reward. This also helps in maintaining the decentralization and consensus of a blockchain network, making it more secure and efficient. Factors to Consider When Choosing a Staking Platform When considering which staking platform to use, there are several factors to keep in mind. These include the reputation and track record of the platform, its security measures, staking rewards and fees, user experience, and customer support. It is essential to thoroughly research each platform and assess how well it meets your specific needs before making a decision. Without further ado, let\u2019s take a look at our top 10 crypto-staking platforms of 2024.

Traditional lending models rely on static data that is often outdated and generic, but we are now afforded the ability to be increasingly granular when making financial decisions. However, while lots of data is great, we need to understand how to effectively translate this data, action it, and embed it into a better customer experience. Our revenue-based finance (RBF) business model relies on a seamless customer journey, so it\u2019s particularly important to me that we get this right across the business, especially when handling diverse financial requirements, from smaller loans to significant investments. A Holistic Approach to Business Health That Is More than Just Numbers Traditional credit models often view businesses through a black-and-white lens, primarily relying on credit scores and financial accounts. In contrast, data analytics offers a more nuanced and informative approach. We're now able to look beyond mere numbers, considering factors like seasonality and recent performance trends. It's about creating a full picture of a business\u2019s health and potential, rather than just ticking boxes. This is particularly important in sectors such as e-commerce, which is where we initially invested predominantly. When tackling a concept like seasonality, traditional analysis of balance sheets or inventory during off-peak seasons can be misleading. Looking at, and cross-referencing, a range of different data points allows us to delve deep into the cyclic nature of e-commerce sales and infer correlations with other inputs such as marketing spend or a specific campaign or event, identifying peak periods and contextualising performance. For example, we have financed many e-commerce companies that typically display low revenue in certain months. However, a detailed analysis of their historical stock and marketing activities often reveals significant sales surges during expected key periods, such as Black Friday. Interestingly, we also observe less predictable spikes. For example, one of our clients aligns their stock and marketing expenditure with major global music festivals. They typically experience a notable increase in revenue about two weeks before these festivals start. This holistic approach allows us to recognise distinct patterns and tailor our financing to each business. Speed, Access, and Flexibility as the Three Pillars of Modern Financing Data without action is just that: data. The success of modern financing, and RBF in particular, can be defined by three key pillars: speed, access, and flexibility, and data analytics plays a huge role in this. Data moves at incredible speeds, and it\u2019s the ability to process and respond to this data in real-time that can elevate a lender's product offering. The advent of cloud computing and open banking has drastically changed access, allowing vast amounts of data to be processed almost instantaneously. This real-time access offers unparalleled flexibility in adjusting offers and funding support based on a company's day-to-day performance. AI and machine learning (read: Large Language Models) will be a pivotal part of business financing in the future. In the future of banking and securities, data engineering will revolutionize operations. AI, cloud computing,.. https://t.co/xBIv29JpFw#MotivityLabs #Mcloud #DataEngineering #Banking #Securities #AI #Bigdata #Finance #DataAnalytics pic.twitter.com/lOcxTh5gkE \u2014 Motivity Labs Inc (@motivitylab) April 15, 2024 The vision will develop tools that can synthesise vast amounts of data into comprehensible, actionable insights. Imagine being able to feed financial data into an AI model and receive instant analysis on a company's financial health, risks, and opportunities. This is where we are headed, a future where data analytics not only support but enhance every aspect of business financing. Treasuries enhance operations through AI-driven data analyticshttps://t.co/XWBINfPZ95#Finance #AI #DataAnalytics #Technology #Treasury #APAC \u2014 The Asset (@TheAssetMag) April 19, 2024 I\u2019ve seen first-hand the power of data analytics in real-time decision-making. We had a repeat customer who hit a rough patch, and our tools flagged this financial downturn, meaning we could communicate with them on the fly, adjusting our approach to lending while maintaining full transparency. This is the kind of agility that data analytics enables, a far cry from traditional models where assessments could be outdated by months if not years. The Problem with Data Of course, data analysis does come with its own challenges. One significant hurdle for us is managing data duplication and ensuring its reliability. In the world of global finance, where we deal with multiple currencies and languages, data interpretation becomes complex. Take, for instance, our operations across the UK and Australia. When we refresh data at midnight in the UK, it\u2019s already midday in Australia. This time difference can split a single business day's data across two days, complicating our analysis and decision-making process. Then there\u2019s the fact that the sheer volume of data we handle doesn't automatically translate to effective decision-making. Finance Data Analysis: How Is Data Analytics Used In Finance? https://t.co/yjNhfOApHR \u2014 Pankaj Kumar (@P4NKAJKUMAR) April 15, 2024 Without wanting to sound like a broken record, it's not just about collecting vast amounts of data; it\u2019s about converting this data into an easily interpretable format that informs sound financial decisions. The information needs to be not only accurate and up-to-date but also presented in a way that is comprehensible and actionable; there\u2019s a real problem with the standardisation of data if it is collected from multiple sources. Without repeating the same point, the focus isn't solely on gathering extensive data but rather on transforming it into a format that facilitates informed financial choices. Data accuracy and currency are essential, but equally critical is how it's presented: clear and actionable. The challenge arises when data from various origins lacks standardization. Open banking is a prime example of this; it\u2019s incredible that statements and accounts can be presented in so many different formats. This process of translating raw data into meaningful insight is as crucial as the data collection itself, and it's a challenge we continuously strive to perfect. The future of modern financing looks healthy. As data points become ever more connected and automated, there is a huge opportunity for lenders to enhance their decision-making processes and offer more measured, sustainable, and tailored lending to customers. The challenge, as outlined above, will be how we make sense of it all.

This real-time access offers unparalleled flexibility in adjusting offers and funding support based on a company's day-to-day performance. AI and machine learning (read: Large Language Models) will be a pivotal part of business financing in the future. In the future of banking and securities, data engineering will revolutionize operations.

Imagine being able to feed financial data into an AI model and receive instant analysis on a company's financial health, risks, and opportunities. This is where we are headed, a future where data analytics not only support but enhance every aspect of business financing. Treasuries enhance operations through AI-driven data analyticshttps://t.co/XWBINfPZ95#Finance #AI #DataAnalytics #Technology #Treasury #APAC \u2014 The Asset (@TheAssetMag) April 19, 2024 I\u2019ve seen first-hand the power of data analytics in real-time decision-making. We had a repeat customer who hit a rough patch, and our tools flagged this financial downturn, meaning we could communicate with them on the fly, adjusting our approach to lending while maintaining full transparency. This is the kind of agility that data analytics enables, a far cry from traditional models where assessments could be outdated by months if not years. The Problem with Data Of course, data analysis does come with its own challenges. One significant hurdle for us is managing data duplication and ensuring its reliability. In the world of global finance, where we deal with multiple currencies and languages, data interpretation becomes complex. Take, for instance, our operations across the UK and Australia. When we refresh data at midnight in the UK, it\u2019s already midday in Australia. This time difference can split a single business day's data across two days, complicating our analysis and decision-making process. Then there\u2019s the fact that the sheer volume of data we handle doesn't automatically translate to effective decision-making. Finance Data Analysis: How Is Data Analytics Used In Finance? https://t.co/yjNhfOApHR \u2014 Pankaj Kumar (@P4NKAJKUMAR) April 15, 2024 Without wanting to sound like a broken record, it's not just about collecting vast amounts of data; it\u2019s about converting this data into an easily interpretable format that informs sound financial decisions. The information needs to be not only accurate and up-to-date but also presented in a way that is comprehensible and actionable; there\u2019s a real problem with the standardisation of data if it is collected from multiple sources. Without repeating the same point, the focus isn't solely on gathering extensive data but rather on transforming it into a format that facilitates informed financial choices. Data accuracy and currency are essential, but equally critical is how it's presented: clear and actionable. The challenge arises when data from various origins lacks standardization. Open banking is a prime example of this; it\u2019s incredible that statements and accounts can be presented in so many different formats. This process of translating raw data into meaningful insight is as crucial as the data collection itself, and it's a challenge we continuously strive to perfect. The future of modern financing looks healthy. As data points become ever more connected and automated, there is a huge opportunity for lenders to enhance their decision-making processes and offer more measured, sustainable, and tailored lending to customers. The challenge, as outlined above, will be how we make sense of it all.

Their plan involves launching a petition to initiate a referendum that would seek to amend the country\u2019s constitution, which will require gathering over 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens. Yves Bennaïm, the founder and chairman of 2B4CH, a non-profit think tank leading the campaign, believes that adding Bitcoin to the SNB\u2019s reserves would safeguard Switzerland\u2019s \u201csovereignty and neutrality\u201d in an increasingly uncertain global landscape, he told to the Swiss news outlet Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ). 2B4CH Finalizing Preparations for the Necessary Documents Bennaïm said that they are finalizing the organizational preparations for the committee and the necessary documents to be submitted to the State Chancellery. However, the process is not without its challenges. The Swiss constitution stipulates that a referendum can only be held if at least 100,000 Swiss citizens sign a petition within 18 months. This requirement posed difficulties for 2B4CH during their first attempt in October 2021. At that time, they launched the \u201cBitcoin Initiative\u201d with the goal of amending Article 99-3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to include Bitcoin as a reserve currency. With a population of 8.77 million in Switzerland, approximately 1.15% of the locals need to support the petition by signing it. Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin-focused trading platform Bitcoin Suisse, who is assisting Bennaïm in this initiative, believes that including Bitcoin in the SNB\u2019s reserves would signify Switzerland\u2019s independence from the European Central Bank and enhance its neutrality. Meisser to Discuss Benefits of Adding Bitcoin to Balance Sheet Meisser will have an opportunity to present the benefits of adding Bitcoin to the SNB\u2019s balance sheet during a meeting scheduled for April 26. However, he will only have three minutes to make his case. In the past, Meisser attempted to persuade the central bank to allocate 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) each month to Bitcoin as an alternative to German government bonds in March 2022. Unfortunately, SNB Chair Thomas Jordan reportedly stated in April 2022 that Bitcoin did not meet the requirements to be considered a reserve currency. Meisser argues that Switzerland would currently be 30 billion Swiss francs ($32.9 billion) richer if the central bank had followed his suggestion in 2022. He also warns that delaying the move could result in other central banks acquiring Bitcoin at significantly higher prices, leaving Switzerland at a disadvantage. The NZZ article discussing the petition has garnered support from Joana Cotar, a German politician and Bitcoin activist who strongly opposes a European Union-backed digital currency. Hahaha. Jap. Genau das!#Freiheit, deshalb #Bitcoin https://t.co/gJwitYCmko \u2014 Joana Cotar (@JoanaCotar) April 21, 2024 As reported, Western Europe has emerged as a leading region in global crypto adoption, attracting a substantial number of daily traders, ranging from 1.2 million to 1.5 million individuals.

The authority issued firm warning, emphasizing severe penalties to those who violate the law. The Angolan parliament passed a bill early this year on the \u201cProhibition of Cryptocurrency and Other Virtual Asset Mining,\u201d which became effective on April 10. Under this law, any form of crypto mining is termed as a \u2018criminal\u2019 offence. As for the legal consequences, possession of information or any crypto mining-related equipment will lead to 1-5 years in jail. Additionally, the Chinese Embassy note, read that the government would confiscate the equipment used for mining purposes. \u201cMining cryptocurrencies by yourself or through others Currency and other virtual assets, or connecting such mining equipment to the national power system, will be sentenced to 3 to 12 years in prison,\u201d it warned. Violators that utilize power facility license to engage in crypto mining activities, will face 3 to 8 years in prison. China Crypto Miners Shift to Africa The warning comes at a time when China\u2019s blanket ban on crypto mining, implemented in 2018, followed a mass exodus of miners to various African nations. This is mainly due to the drastic decrease in the electricity price per unit. Angola, for instance, decreased electricity prices to $17.1 per megawatt hour in 2020. This was the lowest level during the period observed. Overall, prices for electrical energy have been decreasing in the country, according to Statista. As a result, the African nation has become a hotbed for crypto miners, particularly blackballed from nations like China. \u201cSince last year, several Chinese citizens in Angolan have been held legally responsible for engaging in virtual \u201cmining\u201d and suspected of illegal use of electricity,\u201d the Embassy noted. The warning also stressed key hazards of crypto mining, which could easily disrupt economic and financial order. It would also breed illegal and criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, pyramid schemes, etc. The Embassy has specifically reminded Chinese citizens and institutions in Angola to strictly abide by the local rules. It cautioned them to use electricity in-accordance with the law, which does not engage in mining activities.

The fourth Bitcoin halving took place late on Friday at block height 840,000. This marked a pivotal change in the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply dynamics. The halving event occurs approximately every four years and has reduced the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins.

Reductions are part of a predefined strategy to limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million, enhancing its scarcity by halving the influx of new coins into circulation. The latest data from Farside Investments shows that Bitcoin ETF flows are once again gaining momentum after experiencing a slowdown in inflows despite the highly anticipated bullish Bitcoin halving event. Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East Impacting Market The growing Israel-Iran conflict has played a role in impacting the Bitcoin price. Last week Bitcoin saw a sell-off and experienced volatility triggered by the military situation in the Middle East. Usually, Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against global uncertainty. On Monday, Bitcoin price remains stable trading at around $66,300. \u201cOne financial effect of the conflict in Israel was the strengthening of the Dollar, for instance, measured by the U.S. Dollar Index. This is a move towards safety. Portfolio managers reduce the exposure to high-volatility assets in such a situation. Bitcoin has one of the highest historical volatilities in a portfolio that contains stocks and bonds too. So portfolio managers sell Bitcoin to effectively reduce their portfolio volatility,\u201d Basile Maire, a co-founder of D8X, a decentralized exchange told Cryptonews. Macro-Driven BTC Price Largely Driven by Bitcoin ETF Trading Maire went on to explain that we have seen similar Bitcoin price actions earlier this year that coincided with a Dollar strengthening or flight-to-safety. These political events often have a short-lived impact on financial markets. \u201cIt looks like macro-driven price impacts on Bitcoin are largely sparked by Bitcoin ETF trading as opposed to crypto-native trading. The introduction of ETFs also seems to strengthen the impact of macro-events on Bitcoin prices,\u201d said Maire. \u201cFrom the standpoint of portfolio management, it\u2019s understandable that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may experience sharper declines compared to stocks and other traditional assets in this situation,\u201d explains Maire. This doesn\u2019t contradict Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a hedge against global uncertainty in the long run.

The document explored ongoing initiatives, potential use cases in financial markets, and the potential of wCBDCs to alleviate significant industry challenges and address key pain points. It revealed that more than 98% of central banks worldwide are conducting research, pilot programs, or implementation of CBDCs to enhance the functionality of and broaden access to central bank money (CeBM). \u201cCeBM is ideal for systemically important transactions despite the emergence of alternative payment instruments,\u201d the report states. \u201cWholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) is a form of CeBM that could unlock new economic models and integration points that are not possible today.\u201d Building Efficiency in Interbank Operations with CeBM The report states that CeBM is a particularly suitable choice for interbank payments and securities transactions due to several key characteristics. Firstly, CeBM eliminates credit and liquidity risks, aligning with the recommendations of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) for critical transactions. This reduces the possibility of financial instability stemming from these areas. Secondly, CeBM facilitates final settlement of transactions. Backed by a robust legal framework, it guarantees the irreversible transfer of assets, fostering confidence and stability within the financial system. Finally, CeBM promotes financial stability by acting as a virtually risk-free instrument. It complements existing credit creation processes without introducing additional risks, ensuring a healthy financial ecosystem. Disparate Settlement Cycles Hinder Efficiency The report identified eight longstanding challenges within the industry, with four specifically highlighted as areas where a wCBDC could offer significant value. These areas represent opportunities for modernization using wCBDC technology. One key challenge is the issue of \u201cdisparate settlement cycles\u201d in cross-border securities settlements. The globalization of capital markets necessitates harmonized settlement cycles across different regions. However, most real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems operate within limited windows. For instance, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has identified a narrow five-hour window (from 6 AM to 11 AM GMT) with maximum overlap between systems. To address this limitation, the report proposes that wCBDC could facilitate a global settlement window, effectively extending the reach of RTGS systems by offering near 24/7 operation. \u201cThis report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible and secure future for financial markets,\u201d it said.

As of April 21, the average fees for medium-priority transactions on the Bitcoin network fell to a range of $8-10, according to data from mempool.space. The preceding day had witnessed a remarkable surge in total fees, with Bitcoin recording $78.3 million in fees, surpassing Ethereum by over 24 times, as reported by Crypto Fees. Bitcoin Halving Block Includes Record Fee Paid to Miners Notably, the Bitcoin halving block at block height 840,000 included a staggering 37.7 Bitcoin (equivalent to $2.4 million) paid to Bitcoin miner ViaBTC, making it the most coveted piece of digital real estate in the network\u2019s 15-year history. The demand for block 840,000 was largely driven by enthusiasts of memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) competing to inscribe and etch rare satoshis using the Runes protocol, a newly launched token standard that debuted at the halving block. A total of 3,050 transactions were included in that block, resulting in an average fee of slightly under $800 per user. The elevated block fees persisted until approximately block 840,200, as per mempool.space. Subsequently, fees have fallen to around 1-2 Bitcoin per block. The substantial block fee payouts to miners during the halving day initially shielded them from the impact of the block subsidy reduction from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin. However, with the average block fee now well below 3.125 Bitcoin, miners are feeling the effects of the halving. Furthermore, Bitcoin has surpassed Ethereum in terms of fees for six consecutive days between April 15th and 20th, with the 7-day fee average standing at $17.8 million. Interestingly, the Bitcoin halving event did not significantly impact the price of Bitcoin, which has risen by 1.5% since then, reaching $64,840, as reported by CoinGecko. Bitcoin Surges After Halving While Bitcoin did not immediately react to the much-anticipated halving event, the leading cryptocurrency has since registered some gains. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $66,266, up by almost 2% over the past day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. While some analysts, including JPMorgan, have cautioned about a potential further price slide following this quadrennial event, the overall consensus remains bullish in the long term. Just recently, Bitwise said that while the month immediately following the halving typically sees a modest drop in price, the subsequent year often witnesses exponential gains. The asset manager noted that following the 2012 halving, Bitcoin experienced a meager 9% increase in the month post-halving, only to skyrocket by a staggering 8,839% over the following year. Similar patterns were observed after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with Bitcoin\u2019s price surging significantly in the year following each event. Likewise, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has recently said that Bitcoin may experience some selling pressure in the lead-up to the highly anticipated halving event, but the long-term outlook remains bullish.

As Bonk secures a 5.89% increase and a market cap of about $1.34 billion, it ranks #70 on CoinMarketCap. This surge prompts an intriguing Bonk price prediction: could this momentum herald a shift in the meme coin hierarchy, potentially challenging Dogecoin\u2019s dominance? Bonk Price Prediction The pivot point, a key technical indicator used to determine overall market trends and potential reversal points, is currently set at $0.000022 for Bonk. This level serves as a crucial marker for traders to assess the directional movements of the asset. Resistance Levels Bonk faces immediate resistance at $0.000025, with subsequent resistance levels at $0.000027 and $0.000029. These thresholds represent critical points where selling pressure might intensify, potentially capping further gains unless significant buying momentum occurs. Support Levels On the downside, immediate support is found at $0.000018, followed by stronger support levels at $0.000015 and $0.000013. These figures are essential for traders as areas where buying interest might solidify, providing a foundation for the price if downward pressures mount. Bonk Price Prediction The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bonk is currently at 78, suggesting that the asset may be in an overbought territory. Typically, an RSI above 70 indicates that a security might be overvalued and could face a potential pullback. Conversely, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.000017 supports a generally bullish trend from a longer-term perspective but confirms the near-term overbought condition suggested by the RSI. Technical Indicators and Candlestick Patterns: The current chart formation shows a spinning top candlestick under the $0.000022 resistance level. This pattern, characterized by a small body with longer upper and lower shadows, indicates indecision among traders, suggesting potential for a reversal or consolidation. This, combined with the resistance posed by the downward trendline at $0.000022, hints at possible bearish correction in the near term. Market Outlook Based on the technical outlook, Bonk is currently positioned bearishly below its pivot point of $0.000022. A break above this level could shift momentum and foster a more bullish bias. Conversely, failure to overcome this barrier may encourage a downward correction, aligning with the overbought signals indicated by the RSI.

Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC/USD)\u2019s pivot point stands at $64,850, the cryptocurrency exhibits potential for further ascension if it can sustain this level. Technical analysis points to immediate resistance at $66,910, with subsequent barriers at $69,232 and $71,425. Should Bitcoin falter, it faces downward pressure towards support levels at $63,045, $61,387, and $59,686, which could stabilize declines or trigger a sharper sell-off. Bitcoin Price Prediction The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56, suggesting moderate buying activity, while the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $64,682 provides near support, reinforcing the bullish scenario above the pivot point but cautioning of potential declines if this threshold is breached.

Located near Hell\u2019s Gate National Park, the miners have set up shop at the site of an extinct volcano, where they utilize a mobile container equipped with solar power and energy from a nearby geothermal site. This unique setup allows them to mine Bitcoin while simultaneously electrifying local communities. The venture is led by a startup called Gridless, backed by Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block. Gridless Operates Six Mines Gridless operates six mines across Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, all powered by a combination of renewable energy sources. \u201cMost people think about bitcoin and the price of bitcoin and how they can save value in it or maybe spend it,\u201d Gridless CEO Erik Hersman told CNBC. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen without the bitcoin miners and us being globally distributed.\u201d Bitcoin mining is a process that requires substantial amounts of electricity. Miners worldwide run powerful computers to validate transactions and create new tokens. Seeking the cheapest sources of power, miners often face challenges due to fluctuating cryptocurrency prices. However, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value has renewed interest in mining operations, making it more profitable to continue supporting the network. Analysts predict a shift in the geography of crypto mining following the recent halving event, as profit margins become slimmer. Countries with lower energy costs, such as those in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, are attracting crypto miners. This presents an opportunity for renewable energy developers in these regions to utilize their excess power and support the expanding Bitcoin network. Gridless\u2019 Bitcoin Mining Operations Serve Dual Purpose Gridless, founded by Hersman and his co-founders Philip Walton and Janet Maingi, aims to bridge the gap between power generation and capacity in Africa. With approximately 600 million people lacking access to electricity, the company\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations serve a dual purpose. They harness renewable energy sources that would otherwise go to waste and provide electricity to homes and businesses in underserved communities. The volcanic region where Gridless operates, known as Hell\u2019s Gate, has a rich history and is home to diverse wildlife. By leveraging the energy potential of volcanoes, geothermal power stations have been established in the area. This approach is not unique to Kenya; other countries like Iceland and El Salvador have also harnessed geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining has faced criticism due to its energy consumption. However, when coupled with renewable energy sources, it can help unlock trapped renewable power and incentivize increased production. Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers, utilizing excess power from renewable sources and providing financial incentives for further development. Gridless has not only powered thousands of households but also facilitated containerized cold storage for local farmers, charging stations for electric motorcycles, and public WiFi points. Through its mining operations, the company is making renewable energy economically viable in Africa while contributing to the secure functioning of the Bitcoin network. \u201cIt\u2019s not really sexy,\u201d Hersman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mining container made from a shipping container. It\u2019s got a bunch of dumb machines sitting in it running the same equation over and over again, but it\u2019s actually what secures the network.\u201d The post Kenyan Volcano Turns on Lights in Rural Homes with Jack Dorsey\u2019s Bitcoin Mining Support appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"In a remote region of Kenya, a group of Bitcoin miners has found an innovative way to power their operations and bring electricity to rural homes.

While true supporters described the legislation as good in the hour of need, there were quite a few challengers to it, even from the group of privacy advocates and some of the politicians who believed it could go against Americans\u2019 basic rights. New surveillance law, Privacy, and Security Concerns The bill, Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, has received overwhelming support from bipartisan representatives, Sullivan added as a National Security Adviser. It is hoped that it will provide a further constitutional check on the use of Section 702 to prevent national security risks. Such an inheritance gives rise to all intelligence and law enforcement agencies, such as the NSA, the FBI, and the CIA, being able to examine foreign communications without a warrant, which some suppose could eventually lead to direct surveillance of U.S. citizens. Thus, this raises the concern of privacy and security. A distinct divide between the two prominent factors of national security and personal privacy rights was well-illustrated by a legislative process. Although the bill drew widely spread backing mainly because it served as a means to fight terrorism and protect national security, opponents claimed that the bill had the possibility of abusing the powers of surveillance activities. The most notable among the critics was Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justice, who found the bill\u2019s nominal reform inadequate for defending civil rights. It\u2019s over (for now). A majority of senators caved to the fearmongering and bush league tactics of the administration and surveillance hawks in Congress, and they sold out Americans\u2019 civil liberties. Section 702 has been reauthorized, not just without any meaningful reforms\u2026 1/10 \u2014 Elizabeth Goitein (@LizaGoitein) April 20, 2024 Impacts of the Law on Internet Service Providers The bill passed the House; nonetheless, it generated dispute; an amendment that asked security agencies to obtain a warrant for internet-based surveillance occasionally failed in the House. This move was a visible reflection of the ever-growing challenges that must be overcome to achieve the right balance between the need for safety and privacy. As the implications of Internet service providers and privacy regulations continue to evolve, the need for robust surveillance policies and rigorous implementation of these safeguards becomes increasingly prominent. Under Section 702 renewal, the U.S. intelligence agencies may also demand providers like Google or Verizon to display internet users\u2019 data for investigative purposes, thus expanding data collection techniques from their national criteria. This capability raises concerns for consumer rights activists, who fear that the new law would require many internet service providers whose duties are unclear to pivot to government spying. For this reason, the White House says that this very specific act, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, has included the smartest and most powerful set of changes concerning oversight, privacy, and civil liberties. These initiatives are designed to balance the rising demand for intelligence with the desire to respect individual privacy rights. After the law is implemented, discussions on the right balance between national security and privacy will continue, raising several areas of concern like policy, governance, and citizen rights. This continuing dialogue is highly likely to impact the making of laws and, as a result, judicial decisions related to privacy in the United States.","article_summary":"President Joe Biden enacted the continuation and amendment of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), up to the addition of two years to American surveillance practice.

ADA is currently trading at $0.5104. Cardano price analysis shows an uptrend as the coin trades above the $0.5 support level. ADA/USD faces rejection at $0.52, but a break above this could lead to a bullish target of $0.55 resistance level.

Cardano Price Analysis: ADA Moves into a Narrow Consolidation Zone on a Daily Chart On the 24-hour candlestick chart for Cardano price analysis, the price can be seen forming an uptrend after a distinct decline in yesterday\u2019s market.

Cardano Price Analysis Conclusion Cardano price analysis shows that ADA/USD is in a bullish trend, with a price struggling to gain a head. However, the coin faces some downward pressure in the short term and should be monitored for any signs of bearish reversal. Is Cardano a Good Investment?

Currently, ADA is valued at $0.368, having appreciated over 4.6% in the last week. Analysts are forecasting a substantial rise for ADA in 2024. Ali Martinez, a well-regarded analyst, has observed that Cardano\u2019s present consolidation phase closely resembles the pattern from 2018 to 2020. If this trend continues, ADA might maintain its consolidation until July of the next year. #Cardano's current consolidation trend eerily mirrors the 2018-2020 phase! 🔴 If history repeats, $ADA could stay in this consolidation phase until July 2024. 🟢 Barring unforeseen events like the COVID-19 crash, #ADA could break out as soon as December! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/CNsulywN5z \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 12, 2023 However, Martinez anticipates a potential breakout as early as December, predicting that this consolidation could propel ADA towards the $10 mark in 2024. The surge in Cardano\u2019s TVL in its DeFi ecosystem underscores this bullish sentiment, with DeFiLlama reporting a jump from under 200 million ADA at the year\u2019s start to 682 million ADA. The ecosystem\u2019s growth is further evidenced by significant increases in TVL for projects like Indigo, a collateralized debt protocol, and Minswap, a decentralized exchange, each surpassing the $50 million mark in TVL due to growing adoption. Additionally, Cardano continues to lead in development activity, outpacing other significant projects like Polkadot ($DOT) and Kusama ($KSM), reinforcing its position at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Lucid, another cryptocurrency analyst, has set an even more ambitious target, suggesting ADA could reach $30 next year, a potential increase of over 9,000% from its current price. This prediction hinges on the anticipation of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s total capitalization exceeding $10 trillion, driven by global factors acting as catalysts for growth. $ADA is going to $30!👑 Bitcoin proved to the whole world that a $1 Trillion market cap is attainable! Even Ethereum with all its issues hit $500 billion! With inflation the crypto market as a whole will be worth $10 Trillion within the decade! Cardano is going for the 100x!👻🔱 \u2014 Lucid (@LucidCiC) October 31, 2023 FieryTrading offers an even more optimistic forecast, projecting an increase of over 10,000% within the next two years. This prediction is based on ADA\u2019s consistent upward trajectory within a parallel channel, indicating potential for the price to hit the $35 mark eventually. Despite these long-term bullish predictions, short-term forecasts remain moderately optimistic. Institutional interest in Cardano also seems to be on the rise, as evidenced by data from CoinShares\u2019 latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report. Last week, Cardano-based investment products attracted over $800,000 in inflows, bringing their year-to-date total to $8 million. This institutional backing further solidifies the positive outlook for ADA in the near and extended future. Cardano Price History To understand the Cardano Price Forecast, it is imperative to look at the Cardano price movements historically. Before its launch in 2017, ADA coins were already on sale as far back as 2015, and sales continued till January 2017, after which it was launched. Its first rise in price was in January 2018, when it reached a record high of $1.31 due to the cryptocurrency rally. The price soon dropped to $0.15 by April, and by the end of the year, it was worth $0.04. it was worth only around $0.10 in 2019 and started increasing again in late 2020, finishing the year at $0.19. The crypto rally at the beginning of 2021 had seen the value of Cardano cryptocurrency increase greatly, reaching recordord high of $1.49 by February 27, 2021. But, this was just the start, and ADA prices kept increasing. Later, in May, a price of $2.46 was reached by ADA, and this was an all-time high. Thereafter, it continued to maintain its price within the range of $1.20 \u2013 $2. On September 2, 2021, the Cardano (ADA) price reached a new ATH or all-time high at $3.10 and has been the best-performing coin in the crypto world along with Solana, Algorand, Luna, and Tezos for the past month, experiencing a bullish trend. The Cardano price analysis shows negative signs after a brief bullish turnaround. In the meantime, the bulls have lost control of the Cardano market, which could signal new lows for the cryptocurrency. Analysts are optimistic about the fortunes of the market, and ADA could experience a turnaround in 2024 as expected of the entire cryptocurrency market. Cardano (ADA) has experienced a modest increase in its value, rising by $0.01. This uptick is part of a broader positive trend for ADA, which has seen its price increase by 5.23% over the last week, indicating a strong performance in the short term.

Cardano is the habitat for the ADA cryptocurrency, mainly used to send and receive digital funds, making direct transfers fast and possible through cryptography. More than being a cryptocurrency, it is a technological platform that helps run the financial applications individuals and institutions use worldwide. The platform is being constructed in layers that allow for soft fork upgrades. Cardano blockchain also runs decentralized applications and services that any third parties do not control. This is the first blockchain project designed by a global team of engineers and can be implemented on mission-critical systems such as aerospace and banking applications. The Cardano Foundation has also declared the launch of the final version of the Alonzo Testnet, which will feature smart contracts on the platform. The new upgrade is termed Alonzo White, and with this release, investors are attracted to Cardano. Along with this, the coin was also added to the Grayscale Trust, and there are plenty of supporters of Cardano like eToro. Owing to the public\u2019s increased interest in Cardano and smart contracts, the organization behind the currency, Input Output Hong Kong, has spun up the Alonzo Purple testnet. The onboarding process has already been initiated, and the testnet will be made live once done. It was created by Charles Hoskinson, ex-Ethereum Co-Founder, and is considered a third-generation blockchain behind the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was launched back in 2017 to compete with Ethereum. The coin took over the number three spot after Ethereum after blockchain technology company IOHK developers of Cardano ADA announced the date for the Alonzo hard fork on the Cardano mainnet. Alonzo became live on the Cardano network on September 13, 2021, which might lead to a surge in Cardano prices. Projects involving Cardano Cardano has been involved directly or indirectly in several projects since its launch. In April 2019, The company behind the Cardano Blockchain, IOHK, also launched Atala, which is an enterprise blockchain framework designed for the Ethiopian government and other African countries.

In 2020, IOHK launched Project Atlas and Project Catalyst. Project Atlas aimed to improve users\u2019 experience on the Cardano platform through service integration and more accessibility to its tools and products. On the other hand, Project Catalyst sought to accelerate community innovation and develop on-chain governance. Recently, Cardano has partnered with Nervos token and the integration of Marlowe on the Cardano blockchain can come in handy for trading ETFs.

The digital asset album will be based on the Cardano blockchain and is named \u201cZombie Lobster.\u201d The plan is to focus on new NFT projects on Cardano; therefore, Starship Universe, an NFT project, deserves special mention.

ApeCoin Overview MARKETCAP CIRCULATING SUPPLY ALL-TIME LOW POPULARITY ALL-TIME HIGH $1.1 billion 604,895,833 $1.00 #93 $39.40 ApeCoin Price History Yuga Labs founded Apecoin to power the entire operation of their apps and services offered for them to be improved. During its laich, APE price fell to a low of $6.48 within an hour, and it remained in a sideways range between that figure and $9.35 for the rest of the afternoon. Many investors were concerned by the huge gaps in APE\u2019s value, with several centralized exchanges claiming that ApeCoin had dropped 80%. The same discrepancy was evident after initial listings on larger exchanges. Binance for instance registered a high of $28, while Gate.io went as far as $214. Yuga Labs has created an ecosystem where APE can be used as a governance and utility token. One example is the \u2018Otherside metaverse.\u2019 APE would proceed to register its highest price at $39.40. The lowest was at $1. Like the ApeCin, the Yuga Lab\u2019s have NFTs have also registered high volatility, and have lost most of their initial value. Source: https://coinstats.app/coins/apecoin/ More on the Apecoin Network The Bored Ape Yacht Club, long renowned for its satire and humor in trading circles, was the basis for ApeCoin, a cryptocurrency named after a well-known animal. The APE token is a governance mechanism in the APE ecosystem.APE powers the community that is cryptocurrency development at the forefront of web3. ApeCoin cryptocurrency holders can choose the ecosystem\u2019s path and how the DAO spends its funds. Many consider ApeCoin a meme token if not an excessively hyped currency. Some investors/ whales are firmly behind ApeCoin, while others believe its bubble will burst in months. Conclusion APE bears testament to the unforgiving nature of the crypto market. The coin has ridden the initial wave of the NFT markets and experienced multiple bullish and bear runs. A consistent trend is its volatility. Despite these factors, APE has provided utility to the Yuga Labs family meaning it is much less of a meme token. This year, its has shown consistency moving along the market sentiment rather than internal factors. As the year proceeds it might as well trade higher provided the market does not reverse. Future projections are bullish with the coin crossing above $10 in 2028 and $80 by 2033. Will APE crush? APE has proved volatile, while it might crush, it will recover to its former glory in preceding bull markets. The growth of the Yuga Labs ecosystem will also be integral in determining its future performance. Remember to include own research before putting your money into APE.","article_summary":"ApeCoin Price Prediction 2024-2033 Will ApeCoin (APE) break the $3 resistance.

AI has the ability to find patterns that are usually hidden from the human eye, or, let\u2019s say they don\u2019t make any sense to humans. This capability is often helpful in identifying problems that are not in focus but related to the subject at hand. AI machines are predictive, and the more data you feed them, the better results they provide, as they are moving towards an intelligence level, which we can call that of a superhuman level. AI advantage in rugby Coming back to sports, one does not have to explain the rules of the game to an AI system. These models can learn all the rules by themselves just by watching, and by feeding more game footage spanning over years of matches, they will get an understanding of the sport which will be more than any human. If rugby game footage is fed to an AI system in a larger quantity, it can find hidden patterns, as mentioned above, which will enable it to identify the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of any player. If all the matches played by a player in his career are fed to the system, it will learn all the defenses they have made in a match, and how they reacted to tackle any given situation, and the technique they used. As this information will be generated in a short time, and it can be used to take advantage of much better strategies and planning. It can suggest a better plan to identify the players with the most potential, and it can even come up with a plan to win against any player combination. The possibilities are beyond comprehension. Supposing there is a combination of teams in which one team loses the majority of the matches, AI will come up with a formula to win against the other team and will guide them on how to win. Assessing the opponents and the next World Cup Source: Theroar. While assessing the opponent, if the system is fed with a number of matches of the opposite team, it will point out weak points in their strategy, it will identify their techniques and tactics, and will also predict their next move they could make in their play with extreme accuracy. On the other side, teams will have to find new strategies often as the tech gets adopted across all the teams, so the job of analysts will become easy, but the coaches who can\u2019t keep up with the evolving trends will get eliminated. The tech will also help in detecting minute changes in players\u2019 body language and their movements and may suggest if the player is fit or has any problems. With enough data, AI will even be able to predict if any injury is possibly happening to a player. Very soon, AI will be a necessity for any team, as those who have it will be superior in performance to those who lack it. If a team is able to get hold of it now, they will have better chances of winning the 2027 World Cup, and the tech will be much more utilized by the 2031 World Cup. AI cannot beat everything and win rugby matches for a team that is disproportionate, for example, in skills, power, conditioning of the players, and their physical attributes. Human decisions and skills will always win matches on the ground, as AI alone cannot win matches. This is the nature of the sport and will remain the same. The original story can be seen here.","article_summary":"Speaking of professional sports, it will be necessary to take advantage of AI over the next decade, as the teams that don\u2019t have this advantage, it will be used against them.

Sam Bankman-Fried: Playing The Snitch Role Bankman-Fried, once hailed as a crypto messiah, saw his empire crumble in November 2022 when FTX filed for bankruptcy. The exchange, which rose to prominence thanks in part to a star-studded marketing campaign featuring A-listers like Tom Brady and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, experienced a liquidity crisis and ultimately imploded. A group of FTX investors and customers has agreed to drop their claims against co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried in exchange for his cooperation against other defendants in lawsuits over the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s collapse. https://t.co/9xmQo0rgpi \u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) April 19, 2024 Now, from his Brooklyn jail cell, Bankman-Fried appears to be playing a new game. In exchange for his cooperation, investors have agreed to drop any future civil claims against him. This deal, if approved by a judge, could significantly reduce his legal exposure. But what exactly motivated Bankman-Fried to make this move? Some legal experts speculate that Bankman-Fried sees this as an opportunity to potentially curry favor with the court during his criminal appeal. Others believe this might be a calculated attempt to deflect some of the blame for the FTX debacle onto the celebrity endorsers. Can Bankman-Fried Deliver The Knockout Punch? The lawsuit hinges on the ability to prove that the celebrity endorsers knowingly misled investors about FTX. Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s cooperation could be crucial in providing evidence of their involvement and understanding of the company\u2019s operations. For example, if Sam Bankman-Fried can reveal internal emails or communications where he warned celebrities about potential risks associated with FTX products, it could significantly bolster the case against them. However, the effectiveness of his cooperation might be limited. Celebrity endorsement deals often involve carefully crafted scripts and limited due diligence on the part of the talent. If Bankman-Fried can\u2019t provide concrete proof of deliberate deception by the endorsers, the lawsuit could fall flat. The fallout from the FTX collapse continues to reverberate throughout the crypto industry. This latest development, with a disgraced CEO potentially turning state\u2019s witness against celebrity icons, is sure to inject even more drama into an already captivating saga.

The proposed amendment to the Swiss constitution is succinct yet significant. It seeks to modify the clause that currently mandates the SNB to \u201cbuild up sufficient currency reserves from its earnings; part of these reserves shall be held in gold,\u201d to now include \u201cand Bitcoin.\u201d This change, though minimal in wording, could usher a substantial shift in the fiscal management of the nation. Will The Swiss Central Bank (Have To) Adopt Bitcoin? Yves Bennaïm, a figure deeply ingrained in the Swiss crypto scene and a board member of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, articulated that the initiative is not just about altering the reserve assets but is a strategic move to \u201cprotect our sovereignty and neutrality\u201d in an uncertain global economy. According to Bennaïm, the aim is also to \u201cinitiate a debate\u201d on the future financial direction of Switzerland. Support comes from within the industry, notably from Luzius Meisser, President of the asset management division at Bitcoin Suisse. Meisser, who is set to present his case at the SNB\u2019s Annual General Meeting this Friday, April 26 at 10 am CET, stated, \u201cBitcoin is more robust in the long term than euro and dollar investments, which are susceptible to inflationary pressures that could devalue the SNB\u2019s investments.\u201d He also noted that Bitcoin could serve as a declaration of Switzerland\u2019s financial independence from major central banks like the European Central Bank. The initiative has garnered attention from various sectors of the finance world. Leon Curti, Head of Research at Digital Asset Solutions, remarked on the evolving status of Bitcoin in global markets, noting that its classification as a commodity by the US Securities and Exchange Commission \u201cis a legitimization that could ease the SNB\u2019s transition towards including it in its reserves.\u201d From an academic perspective, Professor Gunther Schnabl, who leads the Institute for Economic Policy at the University of Leipzig and has previously advised the European Central Bank, supports the notion. Schnabl highlighted the precarious state of traditional reserve assets, stating, \u201cGovernment debt has risen sharply in most industrialized countries, meaning that the risk of default has increased.\u201d He advocates for Bitcoin as a viable tool for risk diversification within the SNB\u2019s foreign currency reserves. However, not all feedback is positive. Critics point to Bitcoin\u2019s historic volatility and the regulatory uncertainties that still surround digital currencies. They argue that such characteristics might not align with the traditionally conservative strategies employed by national central banks. Swiss National Bank Could Be $32.9 Billion Richer Two years ago, Thomas Jordan, the outgoing SNB Chairman, had dismissed a similar proposal, stating that Bitcoin did not meet the requirements for currency reserves \u201cfrom today\u2019s perspective.\u201d The SNB has yet to comment on whether its stance has changed in light of the new proposal and the evolving regulatory and economic landscape. Luzius Meisser estimates that an aggressive buying strategy could have significantly enriched Switzerland\u2019s reserves given past Bitcoin price appreciation. \u201cIf the SNB had commenced buying CHF 1 billion worth of Bitcoin every month starting in 2022, Switzerland could be around 30 billion francs ($32.9 billion) richer today,\u201d Meisser claims, citing the strong performance of Bitcoin compared to traditional assets like German government bonds. In Switzerland, any citizen can initiate a national referendum to amend the constitution, provided they gather 100,000 valid signatures from fellow Swiss citizens. The referendum, if successful, would not only impact Switzerland\u2019s financial strategy but could also serve as a benchmark for other nations. As the SNB prepares for its upcoming Annual General Meeting, all eyes will be on how it addresses this unprecedented proposal.

While tokens like Dogecoin, born from humor, thrive, entrepreneurs eager to launch utilitarian cryptos face daunting challenges. This imbalance raises critical questions about US crypto regulations and their impact on innovation. Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Criticizes US Crypto Regulations Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz leading their crypto fund, has criticized the existing regulatory practices. He points out that these regulations facilitate the proliferation of meme coins at the expense of more innovative, blockchain-based solutions. According to Dixon, the US crypto regulation unintentionally encourages launching meme coins because they lack practical utility, thus evading the stringent scrutiny applied to potentially transformative technologies. \u201cIt\u2019s actually safer to release a meme coin today with no use case than it is to launch a token that\u2019s useful. Think about it this way: We\u2019d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivized only GameStop meme stocks but that rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA \u2014 all companies with products people use daily,\u201d Dixon wrote. Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks? This regulatory paradox is clear in the relative ease of creating and launching meme coins. This is because meme coins often do not require a team of developers or a legitimate business plan. They thrive on community engagement and internet culture, often gaining value from sheer speculation rather than underlying utility. Conversely, developers aiming to introduce blockchain tokens with practical applications encounter a maze of compliance issues. These tokens could revolutionize payment systems, digital authenticity, and decentralized governance but often find themselves mired in what Dixon describes as \u201cregulatory purgatory.\u201d Additionally, recent initiatives by Andreessen Horowitz, such as its massive $7.2 billion fundraising aimed at sectors like infrastructure and gaming, demonstrate a firm commitment to the potential of these technologies to drive future growth. This is supported by its active role in advocating for regulatory reforms that could level the playing field for serious crypto projects versus meme coins. SEC\u2019s Approach to Crypto Hinders Innovation The primary challenge stems from the application of the Howey test by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Established in 1946, this test determines if a crypto qualifies as a security. Its broad interpretation in the context of modern digital assets has been a point of contention. Despite their decentralized nature, only a few projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have been recognized by the SEC as not involving managerial efforts, exempting them from certain regulatory requirements. The lack of clear guidelines has led to what many in the crypto sector describe as \u201cregulation by enforcement.\u201d The call for clearer regulations isn\u2019t isolated to Dixon\u2019s observations. Leaders across the crypto sector have voiced similar concerns. For instance, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Haun Ventures CEO Kathryn Haun have publicly criticized the SEC\u2019s approach, particularly its recent actions against platforms like Uniswap. They argue that the SEC\u2019s \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d creates uncertainty that stifles innovation and equity within the industry.

Crypto Investing Mistakes Newbies Must Avoid","author":"FM Contributors","article_detailed_content":"Did you know around 1 billion people worldwide use cryptocurrency? While it\u2019s a speculative asset class that can be more of a roller-coaster experience than some people are comfortable with, crypto can be part of any prudent investor\u2019s strategy for financial stability. The same source adds that nearly one in four Americans acknowledge they\u2019re unclear about how cryptocurrency works, which is one reason investors willing to take the plunge should be careful. You can lose more than your shirt with bad crypto investment moves -- so caution is necessary. One survey shows that almost four in 10 American investors who've held crypto have divested their holding for south of what they bought it for. Whether you want to dabble in crypto or establish a strong position in one or more cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ll want to make money. Continue reading to see four investing mistakes to avoid as a new cryptocurrency investor. 1. Don\u2019t Invest Until You Know What You\u2019re Getting Into (Research Is Your Friend) When people think about investors who've become millionaires by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they often pay scant attention to horror stories. Those stories involve people who've lost money chasing the dream of a bonanza of riches. Desiring to invest in crypto is one thing, but understanding this asset class and how it operates is another thing. Any investment, especially in an asset class as speculative as crypto, requires patience. You must understand the terms, analyze the options, and gauge your risk tolerance. Many new crypto investors fail by spending money on an asset class they don't know. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s always vital to research something before making a decision -- and that\u2019s true no matter what you\u2019re focusing on. If seeking a business phone system for the office, you should research the space to make an informed selection. When buying index funds off the stock market, you\u2019ll want to invest sufficient time to find the right stocks. If seeking a fleet management system for your company\u2019s vehicles, you should assess specific needs, see what\u2019s on the market, create a shortlist of candidates, and try some demos before choosing one. 2. Don\u2019t Keep All Your Crypto in a Digital Wallet (Consider a Cold Wallet) According to one source, the worldwide cryptocurrency wallet market size was $8.42 billion in 2022, and it's on pace to expand at a 24.8% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2030. Grand View Research notes that one of the drivers for the adoption of this technology is the growing recognition from individual and institutional investors of crypto as a legitimate asset class. While online wallets are popular and convenient, they also present risks for investors. A quick online search will reveal articles about cybersecurity attacks against owners of online crypto wallets -- and how successful the cyber criminals are. It's better to invest in a cold wallet, also called a hardware wallet or offline wallet, that will keep your crypto holdings safer. 3. Don\u2019t Invest for the Short-Term Period (Think Long Term Instead) One reason some investors get into crypto investing is the hope to turn modest investments into huge returns over the short-term period. However, this type of investment strategy rarely works. Some get lucky and hit the jackpot, but they're the exception rather than the rule. Investing based on the exception is a good way to lose more than your shirt. When you understand the speculative nature of crypto, you\u2019ll see this asset class isn't suited for short-term investments. You need to hang in there for the long term and accept the roller-coaster nature of the asset class. 4. Don\u2019t Forget Crypto Wallet Passwords (You Could Lose Your Holdings) Another mistake crypto investors need to avoid is forgetting their crypto wallet passwords. It happens more often than you might think. If you have an online crypto wallet, put your crypto holdings in it, and later forget the password, you could be in serious trouble. Remember that crypto isn\u2019t regulated as many other investment classes are. If you lose your password, there\u2019s no customer service you can contact to access it or reset it. You could lose your holdings, which can sour your experience as a crypto investor. If you\u2019re interested in crypto investments, consider these four mistakes to avoid at all costs. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a pro, mistakes like the ones listed above can jeopardize your crypto investment strategy and leave you with a case of buyer\u2019s remorse. This article was written by FM Contributors at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Did you know around 1 billion people worldwide use cryptocurrency? While it\u2019s a speculative asset class that can be more of a roller-coaster experience than some people are comfortable with, crypto can be part of any prudent investor\u2019s strategy for financial stability. The same source adds that nearly one in four Americans acknowledge they\u2019re unclear about how cryptocurrency works, which is one reason investors willing to take the plunge should be careful. You can lose more than your shirt with bad crypto investment moves -- so caution is necessary. One survey shows that almost four in 10 American investors who've held crypto have divested their holding for south of what they bought it for. Whether you want to dabble in crypto or establish a strong position in one or more cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ll want to make money. Continue reading to see four investing mistakes to avoid as a new cryptocurrency investor. 1. Don\u2019t Invest Until You Know What You\u2019re Getting Into (Research Is Your Friend) When people think about investors who've become millionaires by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they often pay scant attention to horror stories. Those stories involve people who've lost money chasing the dream of a bonanza of riches. Desiring to invest in crypto is one thing, but understanding this asset class and how it operates is another thing. Any investment, especially in an asset class as speculative as crypto, requires patience. You must understand the terms, analyze the options, and gauge your risk tolerance. Many new crypto investors fail by spending money on an asset class they don't know. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s always vital to research something before making a decision -- and that\u2019s true no matter what you\u2019re focusing on. If seeking a business phone system for the office, you should research the space to make an informed selection. When buying index funds off the stock market, you\u2019ll want to invest sufficient time to find the right stocks. If seeking a fleet management system for your company\u2019s vehicles, you should assess specific needs, see what\u2019s on the market, create a shortlist of candidates, and try some demos before choosing one. 2. Don\u2019t Keep All Your Crypto in a Digital Wallet (Consider a Cold Wallet) According to one source, the worldwide cryptocurrency wallet market size was $8.42 billion in 2022, and it's on pace to expand at a 24.8% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2030. Grand View Research notes that one of the drivers for the adoption of this technology is the growing recognition from individual and institutional investors of crypto as a legitimate asset class. While online wallets are popular and convenient, they also present risks for investors. A quick online search will reveal articles about cybersecurity attacks against owners of online crypto wallets -- and how successful the cyber criminals are. It's better to invest in a cold wallet, also called a hardware wallet or offline wallet, that will keep your crypto holdings safer. 3. Don\u2019t Invest for the Short-Term Period (Think Long Term Instead) One reason some investors get into crypto investing is the hope to turn modest investments into huge returns over the short-term period. However, this type of investment strategy rarely works. Some get lucky and hit the jackpot, but they're the exception rather than the rule. Investing based on the exception is a good way to lose more than your shirt. When you understand the speculative nature of crypto, you\u2019ll see this asset class isn't suited for short-term investments. You need to hang in there for the long term and accept the roller-coaster nature of the asset class. 4. Don\u2019t Forget Crypto Wallet Passwords (You Could Lose Your Holdings) Another mistake crypto investors need to avoid is forgetting their crypto wallet passwords. It happens more often than you might think. If you have an online crypto wallet, put your crypto holdings in it, and later forget the password, you could be in serious trouble. Remember that crypto isn\u2019t regulated as many other investment classes are. If you lose your password, there\u2019s no customer service you can contact to access it or reset it. You could lose your holdings, which can sour your experience as a crypto investor. If you\u2019re interested in crypto investments, consider these four mistakes to avoid at all costs. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a pro, mistakes like the ones listed above can jeopardize your crypto investment strategy and leave you with a case of buyer\u2019s remorse.

Facilitating Targeted Deal Access The newly launched functionality, dubbed 'Appital Trending Equities,' represents an industry-first innovation integrated into Appital Insights. It empowers deal originators on the buyside to proactively stimulate unique liquidity in the market prior to the launch of a deal. Concurrently, participating buyside firms gain access to potential deals that may soon hit the platform, focusing on equities relevant to their portfolios and meeting specific criteria, such as minimum average daily volume (ADV) or pricing thresholds. Mark Badyra, the CEO, Appital, said: \u201cBuyside trading desks will receive a list of trending equities within the Appital platform, which they can discuss with their PMs to identify opportunities they wish to participate in. Traders and portfolio managers are empowered to discover and react to deal flow opportunities that are unique in the market, and generate alpha themselves.\u201d This feature aims to unlock latent liquidity, facilitate the bookbuilding process, and enable trading desks and portfolio managers (PMs) to adopt a more opportunistic approach. By generating orders in the market that might not otherwise exist, the functionality contributes to liquidity events that might not occur through traditional channels. In addressing prevalent challenges such as decreasing liquidity in the lit market, reliance on the market close, and a reduction in high-touch sales trading and associated liquidity opportunities, 'Appital Trending Equities' aims to involve PMs in the deal flow effectively. Attracting Market Interest with Client Base Growth The new functionality is already operational and in use by asset managers who are leveraging the Appital platform, experiencing significant traction. Notably, approximately 50 indications have been discovered by portfolio management teams, representing over $1 billion in potential liquidity. These liquidity event predictions stem from Appital Insights, introduced in Q4 2023. This tool enables buyside institutions to assess the feasibility of executing larger ADV orders without raising alarms in the market. Presently, Appital boasts a client base comprising more than 40 asset managers with over $15 trillion assets under management (AUM). Additionally, over 60 more asset managers, managing an additional $30 trillion AUM, are in the onboarding stage, demonstrating considerable market interest in the platform's capabilities. Brian Guckian, the Chief Business Development Officer, Appital, added: \u201cWe have seen great traction due to our neutral market position and the trust in our platform. Asset managers are happy to share responses to Appital because we are not conflicted on the data and insights and deal originators can better manage their risk before launching a bookbuild.\u201d This article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Appital, a peer-to-peer price discovery and liquidity sourcing technology for asset managers, has introduced a new feature aimed at enhancing opportunistic liquidity within the market.

Brokers\u2019 Focus on Latam TopFX Global, the Seychelles-registered entity that operates globally, holds a Seychelles licence. Its retail offerings include CFDs on forex, indices, shares, metals, energies, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies. The brand is also known for its institutional offerings, as it operates as a prime CFDs broker with 12 years of expertise in liquidity services. For the new role, Mejd is based in the Cyprus offices of TopFX. Several other brokers have also been focusing on their strategies in the growing Latam markets, which are emerging markets alongside Asia and Africa. Recently, ATFX appointed a Growth Manager for the Latam region, while Exness opened its first physical office in Uruguay last year. Two of the largest countries in the Latam region, Brazil and Mexico, have populations of 204 million and 131 million in 2023, respectively, according to the IMF.

Time with Other Brokers Mejd brings more than a decade of experience in the financial services industry to his new role at TopFX. Most recently, he was the Chief Operating Officer at SEC Markets, a retail CFDs broker with claimed presences in Dubai and St Vincent and the Grenadines. There, he spent the last year. However, his most prominent experience was at TTCM Traders Trust, a multi-licensed CFDs broker, where he spent ten years of his career. As seen on his LinkedIn profile, he joined the Cyprus offices of the broker as the Head of Portfolio Management in mid-2013 and then climbed up the corporate ladder to become the Head of Business Development and then the Executive Director.

For the new role, Mejd is based in the Cyprus offices of TopFX. Several other brokers have also been focusing on their strategies in the growing Latam markets, which are emerging markets alongside Asia and Africa. Recently, ATFX appointed a Growth Manager for the Latam region, while Exness opened its first physical office in Uruguay last year. Two of the largest countries in the Latam region, Brazil and Mexico, have populations of 204 million and 131 million in 2023, respectively, according to the IMF. If only 0.2 percent of the population of these two countries trade CFDs, as is the case for the UK, there is a potential for 290,000 active trading accounts in Brazil and 450,000 in Mexico. Time with Other Brokers Mejd brings more than a decade of experience in the financial services industry to his new role at TopFX. Most recently, he was the Chief Operating Officer at SEC Markets, a retail CFDs broker with claimed presences in Dubai and St Vincent and the Grenadines. There, he spent the last year. However, his most prominent experience was at TTCM Traders Trust, a multi-licensed CFDs broker, where he spent ten years of his career. As seen on his LinkedIn profile, he joined the Cyprus offices of the broker as the Head of Portfolio Management in mid-2013 and then climbed up the corporate ladder to become the Head of Business Development and then the Executive Director. He parted with that company last year.

The move deviated from the project\u2019s initial plan to return the funds to its users. In a blog post on April 20, ZKasino announced the launch of its network. Over 10,000 users had bridged a total of 10,515 Ether (ETH) to the network, hoping to acquire the ZKasino (ZKAS) token. However, instead of returning the ETH as promised, ZKasino stated that it had made changes to its original plan. The bridged ETH was converted to ZKAS at a discounted rate of $0.055, subject to a 15-month vesting schedule. ZKasino Backtracks On Promise to Return ETH ZKasino justified these changes as a means to facilitate a smooth transition, as its chain did not utilize ETH. Users also noticed that the project had altered the wording on its website, removing the statement guaranteeing the return of the ETH. Concerns escalated further when an on-chain transfer revealed that ZKasino had moved all 10,515 ETH from its users into the Lido staking protocol. 1 小时前，一鲸鱼在链上以 $3,083 的价格将 1,575 MKR 出售为 485 万 USDT，然后转入币安。 这 1,575 MKR 是该鲸鱼在 03/13-3/22 期间以 $2,871 的价格买入，如今以 $3,083 的价格售出，获利 $33 万 (+7%)。 另外，该鲸鱼曾在 03/29 以这 1,575 MKR 为抵押品在 Aave 借款 100 万 USDT 以 $1.68\u2026 pic.twitter.com/uhxXnMYIPb \u2014 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 21, 2024 Additionally, a crypto developer known as \u201ccygaar\u201d raised suspicions that ZKasino\u2019s released blockchain was merely an Arbitrum Nitro chain, lacking zero-knowledge technology or EigenDA despite the project\u2019s claims. On social media platform X, numerous posts from purported ZKasino users who had invested in the project now accuse it of being an exit scam. Some individuals even resorted to sharing the personal information and address of ZKasino\u2019s founder, known on X as \u201cDerivatives Monke,\u201d while calling for legal action. VC Firm Raises Suspicions Around ZKasino Funds Further controversy emerged when venture capital firm Big Brain claimed, in an April 21st X post, that ZKasino appeared to be fraudulent. Big Brain stated that it had never invested in ZKasino and had not received the pro-rata token distribution that was promised to them. Previously, ZKasino had announced on X that it had secured a Series A investment round at a valuation of $350 million, with support from crypto exchange MEXC and venture firm Big Brain Holdings, among others. However, MEXC distanced itself from the project, stating that it was just one of the investors and that ZKasino\u2019s behavior had nothing to do with them. Big Brain Holdings invested into the @zigzagexchange project in 2022, which subsequently resulted in financial losses for us. Some of the previous founders of that project are now part of the @ZKasino_io team, which appears to be fraudulent. We have never invested in ZKasino\u2026 \u2014 Big Brain Holdings (@BigBrainVC) April 21, 2024 Amidst the mounting backlash, ZKasino has remained largely silent on X, with the project only posting an unremarkable update about integrating EIP-3074. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network. As reported, data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, show that the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

Bitcoin Miners Thrive as Runes Debut Skyrockets Transaction Fees Bitcoin miners are experiencing a significant windfall due to the introduction of the Runes protocol, which has pushed transaction fees to unprecedented levels, offsetting the decreased block rewards post-halving. On April 20, transaction fees soared to $127.97, contributing to a record mining revenue of $107.8 million. The Runes protocol, enabling token creation directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, has led to the production and exchange listing of hundreds of tokens.

Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is experiencing significant upward momentum today, priced at $66,270, marking a nearly 2.50% increase. The cryptocurrency has breached the critical pivot point of $64,853, suggesting potential for continued bullish trends. Immediate resistance levels are observed at $66,910, followed by $69,232 and $71,425, which could pose challenges to further gains. Support levels stand firm at $63,045, with additional safeguards at $61,387 and $59,686, potentially buffering any downward movements. Bitcoin Price Prediction Technical indicators reinforce this positive outlook; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 62 suggests bullish momentum, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $64,788 provides underlying support. Current market behavior indicates a strong buying trend if Bitcoin maintains levels above $64,850, though falling below this threshold could trigger a sharp sell-off.

The school has been widely recognized for its innovative, technology-equipped teaching approach alongside its broad range of education subjects, setting a new bar in China and the rest of the world in the field of educational standards. Shanghai\u2019s Dulwich College Puxi leads with innovative education The new campus of Dulwich College Shanghai, Puxi, which became operational in 2016, strives to serve the rapidly growing population in that area. The school had a commendable event. With a batch of learners from IB programs who made an excellent passage through the International Baccalaureate (IB) diplomas, the first graduation focused on learners\u2019 academic prowess unfazed by pressure. Most graduates have been rated the second-best IB School in China, and they have an average score of 37.7, which makes them capable of competing with other schools worldwide. This success testifies to the school\u2019s determination to uphold traditional academic techniques and willingness to follow the times. Dulwich Puxi pushes the limits of adopting AI and other state-of-the-art innovations in its student body. Among the other schools, it was the first to adopt tools like the Alex Qbot chatbot and Century Tech learning platforms, which set a precedent for using advanced resources to enhance educational outcomes. Artificially Intelligent Instruction and Innovation (AIAI) is one of the courses available among students in the high school years 10 to 11. Design Engineer Construction (DEC) is a core course for Grade 8 students. These courses, which aim to empower students with skills to explore and make sense of the multi-dimensional surface of technology, have been designed. Transformational education at Dulwich College Shanghai Puxi The fundamental goal of extending the technological role in resolving actual world duplicities is at Dulwich College Shanghai Puxi. A noteworthy project is the upcoming Planet Hack hackathon, which was jointly organized by ANU and the college . This occasion is a platform for the students to combine advanced environmental problems via research, ideas, and prototype designs that demonstrate how they have translated what they learned in the class into practical scenarios. Furthermore, the school has been celebrated for its internationalism on a national and global level. Dulwich Puxi has been nominated for the 2024 Tes Awards for Best Use of Technology, which bears testimony to the school\u2019s ability to ensure integrated tech usage in the classroom environment. In the co-curricular club, students are encouraged to take part in sporting activities, music, and community work, which surface the endorphin hormone. Programs like the Duke of Edinburgh International Award and The Ignite: Swiss students are grateful for this program because it provides ample training for modern survival rather than just being academically good. Dulwich College Shanghai Puxi\u2019s vision for future education Paving the way for the rest, Dulwich College Shanghai Puxi led the way in implementing the digital future transformation model. Today\u2019s existence proves that the concept is no longer just a theory but an actual reality. The college provides instruction that encourages students\u2019 superior reasoning and problem-solving skills. Moreover, combining inventive approaches in technology will make the school effective in providing the necessary educational needs of its learners in the future. The upcoming conference on The Future of Education, which will cover Dulwich Puxi, Dehong Shanghai, and Dulwich Pudong, will allow one to learn much about this leading educational institution.

This has led to discussion from people views about the similarities and differences between the two personalities of Mark Zuckerberg, an AI one, and the real one of Meta Platforms Inc. The video consists of a simulation of Zuckerberg, who interacts with the audience on various topics, e.g., producing threads of fictitious projects or taking part in different games like Rapid Fire and 2 Truths 1 Lie. Performance of the AI Zuckerberg The audience of the video clearly recognized this because the presentation of this video took another direction. Zuckerberg was in some posture, which could have been plausibly the sitting or standing position, which made him visually distinct from the real Zuckerberg. However, despite efforts to make the AI sound more human in the blinking part, there were striking differences in its mannerisms in general. Nevertheless, the voice mimicry was very accurate when it came to Zuckerberg\u2019s unique voice pattern in terms of pitch and intonation. Still, the AI\u2019s response lacked some necessary level of understanding. To exemplify, in the challenge that required to describe Meta on the thread and 1 hashtag in 20 seconds using merely an emoji, AI Zuckerberg clearly and succinctly answered that meta globe emoji is shaping up the social ties of the future in the metaverse. Join us at it thumbs-up emoji. However, this type of reply highlighted the common, Cryptocurrency market insights Digital awareness also extends to cryptocurrency interactions, where investors have observed major differences in market movement. As current evidence shows, large-scale acquirers, often called crypto whales, are on the verge of re-entering the market due to growing interest. They are also presumed to be aggressively stocking up with a medium\u2014to long-term view, solely presuming that Bitcoin will surely pass the $100k mark in 2024. This group is speculated to be aggressively stocking up with a medium to long-term view, solely presuming that Bitcoin will surge past the $100k mark in 2024. The insights were top-notch, and Benzinga has recently launched a limited promotional push with a $7.95 fee that gives access to superior cryptocurrency research, stock tips, and crypto-related articles. This decision is made while traditional cryptocurrency investment progression is being seen to be limited after bull runs in 2020 and 2021. Technology and personality: Film the thin red line. The video and the way it is becoming popular appeal to the prospect of artificial media sharing people\u2019s personal experiences. While AI technologies have come to the extent where authentic-sounding conversations and personalized interactions can substitute human ones, a distinct difference is still obvious, especially in terms of tons of imponderability remaining in human relationships, such as genuine emotions, spontaneous attitudes, and so on. The act of the AI Zuckerberg hanging out in the TechnoCard game 2 Truths 1 Lie shows such a gap. Unlike natural human interaction, the method of interacting with the game seemed quite similar to how a chatbot will process such prompts and respond, leading with a reply of Okay, 2 Truths, and a Lie, here we go, which could only be attested to the computer program. With the development of AI, human and machine figures both continue to have boundaries that are more and more indistinct while at the same time becoming more exciting to see. Furthermore, artificial intelligence is now used in media platforms, such as YouTube. Because AI plays a major role in entertainment and communication, we are called to think about its future role in every aspect of our lives, including posing questions about authenticity, privacy, and human interaction in the age of digitalization. However, while investors are noticing the crypto market\u2019s growth, they still introduce this technology to the financial market and try to predict players\u2019 actions in the future.

On the other hand, enthusiasts view digitization of artists\u2019 likenesses, such as Dal, as the best method through which people can get to understand more about their work, and more so to preserve their legacy in the digital age. As technology progresses, the AI capability of creating the likeness of historical characters and celebrities is also expected to become popular. However, this is a double-edged sword, it can stimulate education and leisure, but the world needs to take into account ethical issues.

Purdue\u2019s research strengths and success in aviation and AI \u2014 linked with Windracers\u2019 expertise in transportation of the future \u2014 makes for a powerful innovation engine.\u201d Source: Purdue University. According to the university, AIDA3 will help in providing innovative solutions for UAVs and other autonomous vehicle systems, and their focus will be on scaling up these solutions as the demand grows in the industry. From the crossroads to the smart crossroads of America On the project page of Purdue\u2019s website, the university says that Indiana is considered the crossroads of America, and they are striving to make it the smart crossroads of America. As according to estimates, over 1 million commercial UAVs will be flying across the US performing more duties than just delivering packages by 2027. These unmanned systems will be used in fighting wildfires, defense, humanitarian services, and also emergency services. It is due to this demand, which is expected in the near future, that the university has launched the center. Whatever smart solution will be developed in the center will be put to the test in real life. Mentioning AIDA3 as the first major progress of Purdue\u2019s Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence (IPAI), Sabine Brunswicker, director of the center, said, \u201cWith IPAI, we focus on practical innovations that bring together the \u2018bytes of AI\u2019 and the \u2018atoms of what we grow, make and move,\u2019 and AIDA3 will make this reality in the realm of aviation transportation. We are thrilled to be undertaking this journey with our partners at Windracers.\u201d Source: Purdue University. The combination of Windracers and Perdue is a match well made, as Windracers is a champion of low-cost logistic solutions and will provide a real-life experience that they gained from their business operations based on their patented autopilot system for the Royal Navy, British Antarctic Survey, and Royal Mail. While Perdue boasts an extensive research profile across many fields of engineering, science, and arts. Windracers will also bring two of their long-range, fixed-wing UAVs to support the research and development work of AIDA3.

Shibarium Faces Temporary Service Disruption Popular Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya shared the information on the X (formerly Twitter) platform today while offering an update on the development. This development underscores the difficulty in upholding reliable network infrastructure in the face of increasing demand and changing technological environments. It is important to note that since the launch of Shibarium, the feature has had several network outages. Following its founding in August last year, Shibarium witnessed a significant technical problem, which resulted in the failure of its mainnet Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Shibarium consequently underwent a rigorous two-week scaling period before relaunching on the main net and continuing to function ever since. Kaal Dhairya noted that networking problems amongst Shibarium validators caused the recent temporary service outage. Specifically, these Shibrium validators are organizations in charge of verifying transactions on the platform and preserving the integrity of the network. Although the network has fully recovered, several services, such as the platform\u2019s block explorer Shibariumscan and external RPCs, may still be unavailable until the suggested actions are taken, indicating the team\u2019s continued effort to resolve the technical issues. The post read: There was a temporary Shibarium outage caused because of networking issues amongst the validators. The network is back up and running now, some services like Shibariumscan or external RPCs can still remain down until the steps provided are implemented. Given some services are still down, Dhairya has urged every external team working on the platform\u2019s infrastructure, like RPC, to get in touch in order to arrange for more efficient communication over shared Slack and Telegram channels. Latest UI Update On The Layer 2 Solution The recent mishap came in light of the inception of the latest User Interface (UI) upgrade on the layer 2 protocol designed to help link Shibarium to other leading platforms and improve the blockchain experience for users. \u201cWe expanded wallet compatibility with MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and Wallet Connect to let you Shibas connect the way you want,\u201d the team stated. According to the team, user experience and speed were their top priorities while rebuilding the platform. Thus, they are constantly working to improve the utilization and potency of blockchain technology. With this new UI update, the solution\u2019s performance is bound to improve, making it more rapid, smoother, and more accessible than ever. This upgrade is also indicative of Shibarium\u2019s consistent efforts to expand accessibility and usability in the context of decentralized finance.","article_summary":"Amidst the burgeoning landscape of cryptocurrency solutions, Shiba Inu\u2019s layer 2 protocol Shibarium suffered a major setback due to a temporary network outage within the platform that affected users\u2019 seamless operations and experience.

How Crypto Founders Stole $26.7 Million Through Presales The most notorious of these projects was \u201cI like this coin,\u201d with the ticker symbol \u2013 LIKE.

Blockaid\u2019s co-founder, Ido Ben-Natan, attributed this surge in fraudulent activities to the increased popularity of presale tokens. Scammers have exploited investor FOMO (fear of missing out) by mimicking legitimate transactions and creating sophisticated fake websites. \u201cFirstly, the exponential increase in pre-sale token uptake in February and March, fueled by the popularity of legitimate meme coins, has provided fertile ground for scammers,\u201d Ben-Natan explained. Individuals known as Jared_eth and Bluekirbyftm have been identified as some of the culprits behind these operations. Additionally, the Solana blockchain has seen the rise of meme coins with offensive and racist themes, which has led to severe backlash from the crypto community.

That is, according to a recent X post by popular independent blockchain detective ZachXBT. Per the post, the projects had raised a combined $26.7 million, albeit through the controversial presale method. However, investigations have revealed that nearly all the tokens have plummeted since launch, with a particular one not even taking off with any token launch at all. ZachXBT detailed a meme coin dubbed \u2018I like this coin\u2019 as probably the most expensive one in the Solana presale meme coin projects pack that has been abandoned. The meme coin, which sported the ticker LIKE, raised a staggering 52,220 Solana (SOL) ($7.7 million at current prices) and launched with a market capitalization of $577 million on March 17. However, the meme coin shed over 90% of its value within the first eight hours of launch. As of press time, LIKE is down 83.08% from its launch price, per CoinMarketCap data. Other than its price movement, the official X account of the LIKE coin has not posted anything since March 31. Additionally, the supposed founder pokeee.eth has not mentioned the coin in a long while as well. Another notable token in the list of abandoned presale meme coin projects is MOONKE. The token launched on March 20 to a rather outsized valuation of about $500 million. However, just as was the case with LIKE, MOONKE soon began its own downward spiral that saw it plunge over 99% from its launch price in just a few hours. Notably, a project reportedly raised 4,567 SOL (over $810,000 at current prices) but never even launched a token. Meme Coin Frenzy Dying Down? Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there might be a larger thing at play considering that the market\u2019s appeal for memecoins has somewhat dwindled in recent weeks. For a better perspective, even bigger Solana-based meme coins are somehow losing their steam. For instance, Dogwifhat (WIF) has lost over 45% since April 1. Without a doubt, meme coins are currently a shadow of themselves. Just last month, they were doing impressive numbers to the point that market analysts started drawing comparisons to the 2017 boom era of the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO). However, one might also recall that, although hundreds of crypto projects raised millions of dollars during that period, most of them eventually failed to live up to expectations. next 12 Solana Presale Meme Coin Projects \u2018Completely Abandoned\u2019 Less than Month Later","article_summary":"Coinspeaker 12 Solana Presale Meme Coin Projects \u2018Completely Abandoned\u2019 Less than Month Later The projects had raised a combined $26.7 million, albeit through the controversial presale method. 12 Solana Presale Meme Coin Projects \u2018Completely Abandoned\u2019 Less than Month Later","guid":"https://www.coinspeaker.com/?p=297456","_id":{"date":"Mon Apr 22 17:07:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713780441},"creation_date":"2024-04-22T15:59:26Z","category":["altcoin news","cryptocurrency news","news","dogwifhat","like","moonke","sol","solana","wif","zachxbt"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://www.coinspeaker.com/12-solana-meme-coin-projects-abandoned/","website_source":"feeds.feedburner"},{"article_title":"$60 Million Tether (USDT) Already Issued on TON within Three Days after Launch","author":"Bhushan Akolkar","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker $60 Million Tether (USDT) Already Issued on TON within Three Days after Launch Soon after Tether announced bringing its USDT stablecoin to the TON blockchain network last week on April 19, there\u2019s been a massive issuance happening so far. As per reports, over $60 million in USDT is already issued on TON, thus making it the 11th largest blockchain for Tether. During the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai last week, Tether announced its collaboration with the TON Foundation. This allows Tether to freely mint its USDT stablecoin on the TON blockchain. Apart from USDT, Tether also launched its gold-pegged Tether Gold (XAUT) stablecoin on TON. The Open Network team announced on X that cross-border payments were effortless, free, and instantaneous, likening the process to sending a text message to Telegram\u2019s extensive user base of 900 million individuals. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, remarked in an April 21 post on X that the endeavor had seen a promising beginning, with $35 million USDT issued on TON. Nevertheless, as per the Tether Transparency report, the authorized supply issued on TON has expanded to $60 million by 11:30 pm UTC on April 21. The Tether and TON Collaboration This collaboration between Tether and the TON blockchain will allow Telegram users to freely transfer their USDT across all platforms and almost instantly. \u201cAll you need to do is send a DM, no need for a blockchain address, and no need to download a new app,\u201d said Telegram. USDT on the TON Network comes with fully integrated on-ramps from most of the global fiat currencies. Additionally, very soon, global off-ramps will allow users to withdraw the supported fiat currencies directly to their cards or banks. However, more than 50% of Tether\u2019s circulating supply is currently on the Tron blockchain. The circulation of USDT on Ethereum has decreased to $51 billion, as more Tether is being utilized on alternative blockchains to mitigate the high network fees experienced on Ethereum. Solana stands as the third-largest network accommodating Tether, with a total issuance of $1.9 billion. Additionally, the stablecoin has been deployed on various other blockchains such as Avalanche, Omni, Cosmos, Tezos, Near, EOS, and Celo. Tether\u2019s share in the entire stablecoin market is currently at 69%. On the other hand, Circle, its closest rival has a market share of 21%.

The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has helped increase the overall demand. Combined with the recent approval of spot BTC ETFs in Hong Kong, it is safe to assume the Bitcoin bulls are in control. Furthermore, almost all indicators are pointing to an inevitable new all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Network Reorganization Bitcoin miners have been preparing for the halving event in the past week, whereby the overall hash rate dropped from 700Ehash/s on April 14 to around 595Ehash/s on Monday. The continued increment in the overall mining difficulty has compelled miners from all over the world to upgrade their rigs to the latest versions. Following the notable changes in Bitcoin miners, the cost of sending BTC has experienced significant volatility in the past few days. Over the weekend, overall fees paid to Bitcoin miners surged despite a decline in non-zero addresses. According to hash price data provided by mempool.space, the cost of sending Bitcoin via a high-priority option is around $10.18, while that of a low-priority priority is about $8.7.

Perhaps, Bitcoin miners are upgrading their rigs to renewable energy sources through tax cuts and credits. Moreover, the escalating Middle East crisis is set to increase the general cost of crude oil amid rising fiat inflation. What Next for BTC Price after Bitcoin Halving 2024 For the first time in Bitcoin\u2019s history, the flagship coin closed around 2021\u2019s bull cycle top during the fourth halving event. As a result, most crypto analysts are extremely bullish on Bitcoin price and the rest of the cryptocurrency market. According to a popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin price is on the cusp of a nearly 70 percent uproar based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. Notably, the crypto analyst noted that the MVRV ratio dipped below the 90-day average, which has historically been a popular buying opportunity. Every time the #Bitcoin MVRV Ratio falls below its 90-day average since November 2022, it signals a prime #BTC buying opportunity with an average gain of 67%!

The crypto analyst further pointed out that Bitcoin price has been trading inside a horizontal consolidation, but the bulls are in control.

Hiary will succeed Nidal Abdelhadi, who will now focus on personal ventures. This transition follows closely on the heels of the launch of CFI\u2019s SCA-regulated entity in UAE as a Category One licensed broker. Abdelhadi previously served as CEO of the group's DIFC entity, Credit Financier Invest Limited, before transitioning to lead CFI Financial Markets LLC.

CEO Role at CFI UAE Awaits Regulatory Approval Jareer Hiary brings experience to his new role as CEO of CFI UAE. His journey within the CFI Group began in 2018 when he joined the Jordanian division, where he swiftly rose to the positions of Branch Manager and Co-Head of Business Development. Expressing his enthusiasm for his new role, Hiary stated: \"It is an honor to step up as CEO and lead the group\u2019s Emirati entity through its next phase of growth. Building on the solid foundation and recent achievements of Nidal, I look forward to steering our team towards further innovations and success. During his tenure in Jordan, Hiary contributed to the division's growth and success, showcasing talent, industry knowledge, and business acumen.

The first offering under this initiative, SuperBlock Matching, allows traders to easily signal and participate in exceptionally large or illiquid block trades. Liquidnet Launches SuperBlock Initiative to Facilitate Large, Illiquid Trades The SuperBlock initiative is designed to leverage Liquidnet's global buy-side community and expertise in block trading to create a protected space for executing the most challenging trades. SuperBlock Matching aims to provide a more efficient and user-friendly environment for Liquidnet's members by focusing on trades that vary in size based on market and stock market capitalization. \"SuperBlock is a direct response to a request from our Membership and an extension of our existing block trading offering,\" stated Mark Govoni, the CEO of Liquidnet. The launch of SuperBlock Matching marks the first in a series of planned workflows and services under the SuperBlock initiative, which aims to help Liquidnet's members find unique liquidity and execute their most difficult trades more easily. As a global markets infrastructure and data solutions provider, Liquidnet continues to expand its network, which currently includes over 1,000 institutional investors managing a combined $33 trillion in equity and fixed-income assets across 49 markets and six continents. \"Fast-forward to today, and we have an efficient environment that we believe will significantly improve opportunities for members to systematically trade very large blocks,\" said Rob Cranston, the Global Head of Equities Product at Liquidnet. He also credited the company's innovation hub, Liquidnet Labs, with developing and testing SuperBlock Matching. Liquidnet's Expansion and Partnerships in the Financial Industry The technology-driven agency specializing in execution services has been making significant strides in expanding its global listed derivatives offering. In April, the firm hired Alex Grinfeld, a former Executive Director at Morgan Stanley, to co-head its futures business in the Americas. Towards the end of last year, Liquidnet announced a partnership with BondIT, a provider of investment technology, to integrate BondIT's Scorable Credit Analytics into Liquidnet's fixed-income trading platform. This integration leverages data science, explainable AI, and machine learning solutions to enhance the platform's capabilities. Also in late 2023, Liquidnet unveiled a new pre-trade analytics tool for listed derivatives, available in both the US and Europe. The tool aims to provide valuable insights, such as volume, liquidity, and projected activity, to traders before they execute a trade, empowering them to make more informed decisions. Meanwhile, TP ICAP, Liquidnet's parent company, reported a net statutory profit of £74 million for 2023, with an adjusted figure of £227 million. Despite a 28.1 percent decline in the statutory profit, the adjusted figure saw a 17 percent increase. The company also allocated £30 million to its buyback program, demonstrating its financial stability and commitment to shareholder value. Although revenue from the Liquidnet division experienced a slight decline of 1%, the group emphasized the successful completion of Liquidnet's integration, which resulted in annualized cost savings of £43 million, surpassing the initial target of £30 million.

Should Lift for Next Wave of Crypto Unicorn- APAC MD ","author":"Adarsh \u200b\u200bSingh","article_detailed_content":"Australian policymakers and TradFi firms need to level up for the upcoming wave of crypto unicorns, says John O\u2019Loghlen, Coinbase APAC Managing Director. Australia has not yet hit the level of innovation emerging from the country\u2019s crypto sector and is lagging in retail and institutional demands for cryptocurrency. John O\u2019Loghlen, Coinbase APAC MD, acknowledged the requirement to level up the innovations and acceptance of crypto for the upcoming wave of crypto unicorns. Coinbase APAC MD\u2019s Thoughts On Crypto Unicorn According to John O\u2019Loghlen, Australian policymakers and TradeFi companies aren\u2019t performing to the level of innovation emerging from the crypto sector. The lack of regulatory clarity around crypto somehow affects Australia\u2019s performance in cryptocurrency. Startups with billion-dollar valuations are primed for their next wave of crypto unicorns and require clarity in legislation around digital assets so that the sector can be funded appropriately. \u201cI don\u2019t think the penny\u2019s dropped in Canberra or on the high street in terms of just how much great human capital there is in Australia,\u201d O\u2019Loghlen told Cointelegraph. Despite some regulatory advancements in the Treasury\u2019s October 2023 consultation paper and an informal regulatory meeting with policymakers, Australia is lagging in retail and institutional demand for crypto. According to the Treasury\u2019s October 2023 consultation paper, the Australian federal government will regulate the crypto exchanges but not tokens, and exchanges must apply for a financial services license from the local financial controller. John O\u2019Loghlen highlighted an upsurge in demand for the utility of stablecoins, digital remittances, and a swathe. Naming a few of the multibillion-dollar companies in Australia, John O\u2019Loghlen stated that most of these companies would emerge as the next Canva, the next Xero, the next Atlassian, or the next Afterpay. Crypto products, including self-managed retirement funds and High Earners Not Rich Yet (HENRY), are in high demand in the Australian market, said John O\u2019Loghlen. Moreover, the expansion of Coinbase in the Australian market later this year through the crypto campaign is another good news for Australians. The campaign will help regulators and policymakers better understand the power of cryptocurrency. Australia\u2019s Standing In Crypto Space According to the Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) 2024 survey, 95% of the Australians who took part in the survey know at least one crypto, whereas 93% of Australians are aware of Bitcoin (BTC). Source: IRCI Ethereum and Dogecoin are not very popular in the Australian market, as 42% of the participants know Ethereum (ETH), and only 36% of Australians know about Dogecoin (DOGE). Furthermore, only 27.5% of the respondents owned or owned any digital asset in the last 12 months, a drop of 1.9% compared to 2022. Additionally, most investors or crypto traders in Australia are between 25 and 34 years of age, and only 6% of individuals above 65 own cryptocurrency. Moreover, around 49% of the crypto investors who took part in the survey are influenced by their family and friends to invest in digital assets, whereas the media inspire 43%.","article_summary":"Australian policymakers and TradFi firms need to level up for the upcoming wave of crypto unicorns, says John O\u2019Loghlen, Coinbase APAC Managing Director.

Today\u2019s dip means that Dogecoin is down by 2.5% in a week and by 22% in the past fortnight, although the coin has fared better than many others in recent weeks, having overtaken Toncoin (TON) in terms of market cap. And with DOGE still sitting on a 100% gain in a year, it remains in a good position for additional rallies in the coming months. Such rallies could come sooner rather than later, with the post-Bitcoin halving lull likely to give way to more positivity as the market receives improved macroeconomic news. Dogecoin Price Prediction as DOGE Overtakes Toncoin in Coin Rankings \u2013 Can DOGE Spike Up to $1? DOGE\u2019s indicators find themselves at what looks like a crossroads, with the meme coin equally capable of further gains or further losses. Most notably, DOGE\u2019s 30-day average (orange) dipped below its 200-day average (blue) yesterday, but it has now recovered slightly and could be about to climb over the longer term average. Source: TradingView This could be a sign of an incoming breakout, with the coin\u2019s relative strength index (purple) also point up again after falling close to 50 earlier this morning. Such positions are pretty ambiguous, but it\u2019s interesting to note that DOGE\u2019s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other. This may signal an eventual big move, and given that DOGE (and the rest of the market) has been somewhat subdued in recent weeks, it\u2019s entirely arguable that we should go up soon. Indeed, DOGE\u2019s 24-hour trading volume has declined consistently in the past week or so, again implying that a bounce should arrive soon. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the most recent data suggests that some whales had been accumulating DOGE during its recent downturn, preparing themselves for the next rally. 150,000,000 #DOGE (23,552,001 USD) transferred from #Robinhood to unknown wallethttps://t.co/Z7kyHDma8i \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 16, 2024 Of course, it\u2019s hard to say when the next significant rally will arrive, with the wider market being in something of a semi-funk following the Bitcoin halving last week. Yet given that the Federal Reserve is likely to introduce some rate cuts this year, we may see things become more bullish in the next few months. And the Dogecoin price itself may benefit from more championing by Elon Musk, and perhaps from the rollout of digital payments on X. It could reach $0.25 by summer, and potentially end the year at $0.4. Newer Meme Tokens For Market-Beating Gains DOGE is likely to see further notable rallies this year, yet its progress may be piecemeal and relatively modest, at least compared to previous cycles. For this reason, traders seeking bigger, above-average gains may prefer to take a chance on newer meme coins, especially tokens which are holding presales and getting ready to list. One of the best examples of this is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based coin that has raised over $10 million in its hugely popular presale. Prepare for a moonshot as we ready the engines of the Slothship! With the launch just around the corner, our slothful crew is gearing up for an epic journey through the crypto cosmos. Buckle up and hold onto your branches, because there's just 6 days to go \u2026 pic.twitter.com/yHBrE3NP5x \u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 22, 2024 Its sale will end in just under a week, so newcomers are advised to move quickly if they want to buy SLOTH at a discounted price. It\u2019s clear that many investors have already taken the opportunity to get in on the coin at the ground floor, with its launch arriving at a time when demand for Solana-based meme coins is still high. One encouraging feature of Slothana is that it has already managed to build a sizeable community. Its official X account now reaches 23,000 followers, who will prove pivotal in supporting the coin and sustaining it once it lists in the next week. New investors can join them by going to the Slothana website, where they can buy SLOTH at a rate of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH. Once they purchase their SLOTH, they can then wait for next week\u2019s airdrop, at which point they will also be able to sell the coin and potentially make some big profits.

As a result, the EU nation has mandated reporting of income from the sale of mining digital assets. Per a report from a local media outlet Verkkouutiset, in line with the tax supervision following the unreported tax gains last year, the authority has asked those who invested in virtual currencies to pay ten million euros in capital income tax. \u201cThe amount found last year is large in euro terms, which indicates that the control works and is effective,\u201d says Mika Siivonen, tax expert from the Finnish Tax Administration. Besides paying taxes, individuals who have not declared their income are mandated to pay a tax increase and late penalties. Failing to this may lead to criminal sanctions, the report added. According to the findings from the country\u2019s tax authority, a total of 9,800 customers reported receiving crypto income in 2022. This is lower than that of 2021, which reported 16,000 customers. \u201cWhen the exchange rates of virtual currencies have been low, investors have sold less of their holdings than before or for some reason sales losses have not been declared for taxation.\u201d Crypto Income Receivers in Finland Still Fail to Declare Tax Siivonen added that they have been receiving more information from crypto exchanges regarding the crypto transactions of Finnish customers. Per the estimates, still a large portion of crypto income receivers fail to declare their income in question for taxation. The Tax Administration received the information from several foreign virtual currency exchanges through international data exchange. \u201cIf you received income from the use or mining of virtual currencies in 2023, you must declare the income with a pre-filled tax return,\u201d the report read. Further, the income from cryptos is taxed as capital income, and cryptos received from mining is taxed as earned income. Additionally, virtual currencies sold at a loss should also be declared for taxation, it added.

The outflows amounted to a total of $206 million, while trading volumes in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) experienced a slight dip, reaching $18 billion, according to a report from CoinShares. Bitcoin investment products witnessed outflows of $192 million, However, the report mentioned that few investors viewed this as an opportunity for short-selling, with short-Bitcoin strategies experiencing outflows of $0.3 million. Trading Volumes in ETPs Continue to Drop The trading volumes in ETPs accounted for a smaller percentage of total bitcoin volumes, standing at 28%. This figure represents a significant decrease from the 55% recorded just a month ago. The data indicates a diminishing appetite among ETP/ETF investors, possibly due to expectations of prolonged high interest rates by the Federal Reserve (FED). The negative sentiment surrounding digital asset investment products was primarily observed in US ETFs, which saw outflows amounting to $244 million. The outflows were primarily focused on the existing ETFs, while newly issued ETFs continued to receive inflows, albeit at lower levels compared to previous weeks. In contrast, Canada and Switzerland experienced inflows of $30 million and $8 million, respectively, while Germany saw minor outflows of $8 million. CoinShares: Digital asset investment products saw outflows for the second consecutive week totalling US$206m, with trading volumes in ETPs dipping slightly at US$18bn. Ethereum saw US$34m outflows, marking its 6th consecutive week. https://t.co/ZGL8bl5URM \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 22, 2024 Meanwhile, Ethereum faced outflows of $34 million for the sixth consecutive week. On the other hand, multi-asset products saw improved sentiment, attracting inflows of $9 million during the previous week. Additionally, Litecoin and Chainlink saw inflows of $3.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. In the realm of blockchain equities, concerns over the impact of halving continued to weigh on investor sentiment. Consequently, blockchain equities experienced their eleventh consecutive week of outflows, amounting to $9 million. Bitcoin Surges After Halving While Bitcoin did not immediately react to the much-anticipated halving event, the leading cryptocurrency has since registered some gains. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $66,266, up by almost 2% over the past day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. While some analysts, including JPMorgan, have cautioned about a potential further price slide following this quadrennial event, the overall consensus remains bullish in the long term. Just recently, Bitwise said that while the month immediately following the halving typically sees a modest drop in price, the subsequent year often witnesses exponential gains. The asset manager noted that following the 2012 halving, Bitcoin experienced a meager 9% increase in the month post-halving, only to skyrocket by a staggering 8,839% over the following year. Similar patterns were observed after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with Bitcoin\u2019s price surging significantly in the year following each event. Likewise, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has recently said that Bitcoin may experience some selling pressure in the lead-up to the highly anticipated halving event, but the long-term outlook remains bullish.

On April 20, Kusama shared that he and a respected figure were having ongoing primary-level talks about issues related to SHIB. The Shiba Inu community showed tremendous support when the influential artist mentioned the symbolism of \u201cwarm woof\u201d in her work.

It enables trades and staking of ecosystem tokens budget gift cards in leu, including tokens like BONE, SHIB, and LEASH. Starting from scratch, SHIB caught the public\u2019s attention. In January 2023, CertiK, a blockchain security group, ranked it number one among other decentralized exchanges (DEX). The main criticism of ShibaSwap 1.0 was identifying areas for improvement within the DEX, so Shiba Swap 2.0 came into light in 2023. Integrating into the ShibaSwap 2.0 upgraded framework architecture, the new feature will utilize this to expand beyond the conventional token swap mechanism to embed a fully-fledged crypto gateway portal. The portal becomes a central place where anyone can track cryptocurrency numbers, charts, news, and trends, which, therefore, will improve its usage. Then, ShibaSwap 2.0 is planned to introduce fresh and upgraded designs for implementation. The new user layout and operation are to be enhanced and of better quality. The ShibaSwap followers were recently handed some exciting news by their lead developer, who declared that ShibaSwap 1.75 is fixed to be released. This makes it quite evident that the ShibaSwap community anxiously looks forward to the yet-to-come advancements. ShibaSwap\u2019s journey and success After spending some time in the Shiba Swap community, the number of users on the platform has increased, with many coming back to use it because of its simplicity and strong offerings. DEX is a marvelous instrument for swapping and staking tokens that, overall, contribute to the growth of the Shiba Inu\u2019s ecosystem. The ShibaSwap DEX platform has acquired Certik\u2019s certificate, among others that were audited in January 2023 and has emerged as the platform that exceeds the competition compared to PancakeSwap and 1inch Network. This certification, therefore, makes it clear that the platform has stayed true to its word to keep user interaction safe by protecting transactions and integrating with other financial institutions. However, unlike Dogecoin, which tends to stagnate, Shiba Inu\u2019s developers actively make improvements and extend the platform. Recent versions of ShibaSwap 1.75 and ShibaSwap 2.0 represent new releases and mark the beginning of a new history of decentralized exchanges. The more the SHIB community expects new and improved features and functionalities from the Shiba Inu project, the sooner these development milestones will be reached, which will ultimately allow the ecosystem to flourish in its next development stage.","article_summary":"Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu\u2019s leading developer, often shares about the forthcoming release of ShibaSwap 1.75, which would let the chain of events for the rumored ShibaSwap 2.0 clicking begins.

It is not just about SoftBank but also about a network system where SoftBank can share all know-how and capacities with others and be nurtured by other firms. To achieve its objectives by fiscal year 2024, SoftBank plans to finish a large language model with 390 billion parameters, a pitchstone in AI. They have just started; this model is supposed to be the first step towards a model with 1 trillion parameters, and it is expected to start work soon, which is the next step in this new and incredible technology. The world\u2019s best AI model is the appointer, and the organization encourages its performance to follow OpenAI\u2019s GPT 4 standard, the world benchmark of high-performance AI. Economic impact and market outlook The investment is scheduled to take place at the right moment to gain from the Japanese generative AI market, which will be valued at almost $13 billion by 2030, exhibiting a 17-fold growth from the level of $750 million (estimated for 2023). These inherent landmines that AI adoption entails can lead to significant economic growth opportunities, stretching the application of AI to numerous industries. SoftBank\u2019s constantly innovating attitude in this regard seemed a winner, with investors who, through rising shares, are as high as of 2018. Such confidence is seen as the market brightness of AI perspective, which means AI can lead the business in the future. Along with this, there is also the motivation to build national capabilities regarding AI, which illustrates other strategic and economic aspects related to the nation\u2019s data security and sovereignty. Under the increased influence of global dynamics, Japan is seeking to diversify its supply chain, specifically technology advancement, as a way of building capabilities to combat sudden changes in the market or geopolitical tensions. SoftBank\u2019s data center expansion Besides AI, Softbank has diversified by building up its infrastructure networks. The corporation is looking for new data centers within Japan and found them in Hokkaido as its key project, which is huge. These facilities are indispensable for processing data and will constitute a breakthrough in the era of AI-powered products. The venture, which gives the company a broader strategic reach, reflects Softbank\u2019s view that leadership in AI is an inevitable task in global AI takeoff. Furthermore, SoftBank, with those steps, does not just invest in technology but also forms the future Japanese market setting and its technological capabilities.

A current survey done at the University of Southern California and ESCP Business School claims that artificial intelligence will become a gatekeeper for a new kind of job, which requires both humans and machines to work effectively. Integrating human and machine capabilities The integration of AI in the workplace is not an easy task as it will not lead to the total reshuffling of humans with machines. Contrary to that, it is an occasion for reinventing human jobs being exempt by the outstanding skills of both humans and AI. The study may be made by the University of Southern California, which showed that while AI provides the best predictability and more efficiency and more efficiency, the human touch still helps ensure an excellent outcome. This combination of humans and robots is thought to align the best application of artificial intelligence in business environments. According to ESCP Business School\u2019s report, AI would make humans even more emotionally blind to the situation, which they would have to monitor and intervene with. Nevertheless, AI does admit that there can be efficiencies gained by the streamlining of processes plus it can in turn liberate human workers to deal with problems and contribute their emotions where it is most required. According to the report, work in the future will likely be categorized into three types: Even though intelligence might seem impervious to AI, this makes it vulnerable in three broad areas, namely, as an intelligent hand in physical work, an intelligent mind cognitive work, and an intelligent heart emotional work. Future of technology and ethical concerns AI is a stepping stone in many ways and holds many positives, yet the development has its share of unwanted effects. The first issue is the risk that basic human abilities, such as memory, attention, and precision when handling objects, would be replaced. The ESCP paper highlights the importance of understanding and preserving human intelligence, which is structured into three levels: abilities such as the use of hands, problem examination and creativity, and the systemic approach and the level of holism. There lies the difficulty in applying AI in a way that couples with the said human abilities, giving the technology a booster effect, not a displacing effect on the workforce. Organizations should create protocols that would coordinate integration between AI and human capabilities and also to some extent develop these skills within people. Enhancing workforce skills for an AI-integrated future This demand is also heard from industry executives who call for education reform as they are convinced that while AI will certainly transform jobs, it does not mean that the jobs will be cut altogether. Hence, it is more critical to break up with traditional retraining and instead, tackle the issues of appropriate employment of humans in a world of robotics. As the human-to-machine line keeps demanding, it is becoming clearer that the workforce needs to be better progressed and their knowledge needs to be advanced as well. Due care should be exercised while introducing such AI into the workplace to avoid the decrease of necessary human skills, allowing employees to have the capability of not only interacting with AI but of upgrading their skills through education and adaptation too. The present change in the relational map of work is the result of the developing AI technology. That necessitates us to reconsider the skills development and the way they are implemented. In that sense, yielding the mutual advancement of human and machine intelligence, organizations can make the most of AI to increase effectiveness and enhance innovation. Alongside this, the development and multiplication of human skills will become the most pressing task for the workforce that is currently in the middle of a revolution. The AI-enhanced prospects are required to adapt and conform the survive and prosper in this hi-tech world. Responding to job shifts that a growing AI role as a proprietor brings, both in business practices and educational facilities, is a necessity. Educational institutions, both schools, and universities, shall be geared towards knowledge transference instead of training students with skills pertinent to the promising and unprecedented technological development. Proactive and lifelong learning skills along with continuous skills development would be necessary for workers to remain on the top of the game in their line of business.

Tax and technology have interconnected to a greater extent, especially with the widespread of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Tax functioning is changing at a fast pace that has never been seen before, as tax authorities are digitizing. Tech tools for taxation As we know, business leaders are always on the hunt for knowledge as to how they can speed up their use of tech tools so that they can create more capability in their teams and use data to get more insights from it. Compliance obligation never stops at one point and keeps expanding, and heads of tax departments are asked to meet the requirement at a much faster pace while maintaining the quality. The point here is that how the tech is reshaping the tax future. And what must the tax heads do to utilize the potential that it offers? Authorities around the world are sharing information with one another and adopting data analytics and digital operations, which is why they are provoking a shift towards progressive compliance from relying on hindsight. So we can say that the main drivers of tech disruption in the tax sector are may be these authorities. Source: Pwc. Role of leadership Take AI as an example, it can help professionals in the tax sector to know the savings hidden in their data and to identify the actual tax risks, and also stay updated on the most recent regulatory changes. AI solutions can also tell about how tax laws apply to a specific situation at hand with real-time insights.

The general service of the Kenyan police picked Anjarwalla because of his successful avoidance of capture in Nigeria. The controversy centers on whether Anjarwalla has evaded taxes, speculated on currency, and washed $35.4 million through the bank. Olukoyede, the EFCC chairman, announced that the Commission had intensified its efforts for Anjarwalla\u2019s capture and will return him to Nigeria to face justice. EFCC is now working along with other international law enforcement agencies to make sure that Anjarwalla is being repatriated. EFCC\u2013a commission committed to fight financial crimes that may affect the Forex market through corruption or fraud in Nigeria\u2013accused Anjarwalla. EFCC\u2019s vigilance leads to Binance executive\u2019s arrest Close cooperation among the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol), the Nigeria Police Force, and the Kenyan Police Service has increasingly focused on speeding up Anjarwalla\u2019s extradition. This created the required international siege, which ended with the defendant\u2019s extradition from Kenya. The emphasis of these discussions is on expediting her extradition process so that she can be returned to Nigerian detention as soon as possible, which is the purpose of such discussions. The charge extradition process for Anjarwalla, who is a Binance executive, is a very big step for the alleged financial misconduct. Anjarwalla\u2019s persecution by the EFCC shows how serious the commission is about not allowing economic crimes to become part of Nigeria\u2019s economic fabric. However, with the arrest of Anjarwalla in Kenya and the soon-to-be extradition to Nigeria, authorities want justice, which is believed to involve the fraudster in a financial crime. Legal proceedings and prosecution The EFCC\u2019s recent arrest and prepared extradition of Anjarwalla are linked to its work on Binance Holdings Limited and its officials. The same accusations, together with currency speculation and tax evasion, are attributed to Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan. Although Gambaryan is already behind bars at this time, Anjarwalla\u2019s extradition process is proceeding with great success. The EFCC\u2019s aim in Anjarwalla\u2019s case is in line with its mission to prevent crime in the financial sector and defend Nigeria\u2019s economic integrity. The return of Anjarwalla from another country emphasizes the need for the cooperation of countries internationally to combat transnational financial crimes. The EFCC\u2019s fastidiousness and closeness with worldwide law enforcement agencies are signs of Nigeria\u2019s seriousness in tackling unlawful financial activities.","article_summary":"The Federal Police Service of Kenya is underway in extraditing Nadeem Anjarwalla, a high-ranking Binance official who escaped from custody in Nigeria.

These adaptations are about to make the AI capabilities of the company more accessible yet efficient to its numerous users. The company has taken a further step forward by releasing its Llama models to developers, providing a robust ML tool with the possibility to put under question the revenue models of its rivals. This transparency, however, has led to some reservations about the technology coming from potentially abusing the technology. Meta AI development and strategic partnerships toward global expansion Meta equips Llama 3 with superior coding capability in addition to the new pictorial data in training, but now it produces text instead of images.

The services that steal people\u2019s attention and are unregistered by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society should be blocked. Due to this, people will be able to use services from trusted providers. With a view to being considerate to users, the Thai government plans a transitional period to allow the management of personal accounts and withdrawal of proceeds before the block is enforced. According to the SEC, the withdrawal of assets from the affected platforms must be immediately done to fulfill the regulatory directive and minimize disruption. This deliberate method demonstrates Thailand\u2019s resolution to achieve the twin goals of regulations and protection of the stakeholders. Transition period for users While the system is still being developed, people can manage their accounts and withdraw their assets from the illegal crypto platforms in Thailand prior to access being restricted. The initiative is meant to help users transition seamlessly while at the same time ensuring the user interfaces are in line with the regulations of the SEC and other authorities.

Park shared valuable insights into the ETF approval process, the industry\u2019s response, and the broader implications for Bitcoin adoption. The Long Road to Approval The journey to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US has been a marathon, spanning over a decade since the Winklevoss twins filed the first application. Park acknowledged the persistence and determination required to achieve this milestone: \u201cIt\u2019s been close to plus 10 plus years of the timing of the application since its first inception with the Winklevoss twins. And so some of, I think, the growth that we\u2019ve seen was because there was a lot of capital on the sideline anticipating this for almost a decade.\u201d Exceeding Expectations Despite the lengthy approval process, the inflows into the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed industry expectations. Park attributed this to the pent-up demand from investors who had been eagerly awaiting this opportunity: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s gone beyond our expectations as well. We try to be conservative in our estimations of what inflows could be, but the truth is that this has been a long marathon here in the U.S.\u201d Changing Perceptions One of the key impacts of the Bitcoin ETF launch has been the shift in perception surrounding the asset class. Park highlighted the newfound confidence among investors, citing a recent family office conference where questions about the legitimacy of crypto were no longer raised: \u201cAnecdotally, I was at a family office conference last week and it was the first time in a while where nobody asked the question, \u2018is crypto here to stay?\u2019 It\u2019s just out of the purview and, and that\u2019s an incredible feeling.\u201d Is Bitcoin Safer at Higher Prices? In a counterintuitive observation, Park suggested that Bitcoin might be perceived as a safer investment at higher price points due to the increasing acceptance and adoption of the asset class: \u201c[Bitcoin] is safer to buy it at $70k versus when it was at $10k because of all the ways that it\u2019s become accepted in the psyche of people to think of this asset class.\u201d The Overton Window and Bitcoin\u2019s Supply Park also touched on the U.S. government\u2019s daily interest burden, which he compared to the daily issuance of new Bitcoin. This perspective challenges the traditional notion of Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply: \u201cThe Overton window is actually incorrect. It\u2019s not even about the issuance of new Bitcoin. It\u2019s where the other fiat-based currency is finding inflation, and this is counterbalancing.\u201d As the crypto industry continues to evolve, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the US marks a significant milestone, signaling growing acceptance and mainstream adoption. Jeff Park\u2019s insights from Bitwise provide a unique perspective on this historic event and its potential implications for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.

The campaign is spearheaded by Yves Bennaïm, the founder and chairman of 2B4CH, a nonprofit think tank, and enjoys support from Luzius Meisser, the chairman of asset manager Bitcoin Suisse. Bennaïm said: \u201cWe are in the process of completing the organizational preparations for the committee and preparing the documents that must be submitted to the State Chancellery in order to start the process.\u201d What next? The referendum\u2019s launch hinges on securing 100,000 valid signatures from Swiss citizens. Subsequently, all Swiss nationals will vote on the proposed constitutional amendment. All of these processes could take as much as five years. Meanwhile, Meisser will champion Bitcoin at the upcoming Swiss National Bank\u2019s general assembly. Notably, this isn\u2019t Meisser\u2019s first foray into advocating for Bitcoin. Previously, he proposed a similar action at the 2022 General Meeting, urging the bank to prioritize Bitcoin investments over German government bonds. He estimated that had the bank heeded his advice, Switzerland would now possess an additional 30 billion francs. In 2021, 2B4CH initiated the Bitcoin Initiative, intending to enshrine BTC as a reserve currency in the Swiss Constitution. However, the process suffered some hiccups, which Bennaïm explained were caused by the timing and need for discussion. He said: \u201cThe reason why it took some time since the original 2021 announcement was not the 100,000 signatures\u2026we wanted to first discuss openly with the SNB and give them the opportunity to start adopting Bitcoin before moving forward with the official procedure.\u201d If the Bitcoin advocates\u2019 plan succeeds, Switzerland could become the first country in the West to embrace the flagship crypto asset. However, it would trail behind El Salvador, a Central American country that has made substantial investments in BTC and adopted it as a legal tender.

Over the weekend, a joint operation involving various agencies\u2014such as the Economics and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria Police Force, Kenya Police Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)\u2014successfully captured him in Kenya after weeks of search. Following his arrest, local media outlet Punch, citing an undisclosed government source, revealed that Anjarwalla is slated for extradition to Nigeria within the week. There, he faces trial on charges related to tax evasion. Moreover, the Nigerian law enforcement agencies might pursue additional charges regarding his use of illegal passports and escape from custody. Anjarwalla, Binance Africa\u2019s regional manager, and another executive, Tigran Gambrayan, found themselves in legal trouble in Nigeria in February after the authorities detained them over their connections to the crypto exchange. However, Anjarwalla managed to slip away from legal custody in March using a Kenyan passport and has been on the run since. Updates on Binance situation in Nigeria This development further exacerbates the ongoing conflict between Binance and the Nigerian authorities. Gambrayan, a key Binance executive detained since February, is on trial for alleged tax evasion. Notably, the tax evasion proceedings have faced challenges. A Nigerian court has adjourned the case twice because the exchange was not formally served with the charges. The judge is expected to rule on the matter by May 17. Binance CEO Richard Teng has pledged cooperation with Nigerian authorities to resolve the issue. However, specific efforts to secure the release of the detained executives remain undisclosed. Meanwhile, Gambrayan\u2019s effort to secure his release has also faced setbacks. A federal high court at the nation\u2019s capital, Abuja, postponed his bail application hearing, and he is currently being held at the Kuje correctional center.

B3 Bitcoin Futures Sees Surge In Demand Following its launch of Bitcoin futures on April 17, B3 experienced a massive wave of demand and interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts eager to trade the newly listed Bitcoin futures. The stock exchange reported that on the debut trading day, more than 7,400 Bitcoin futures contracts were actively traded. This unprecedented trading volume underscores investors\u2019 strong interest in cryptocurrency derivatives as well as the increasing demand for BTC exposure among Brazilian cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts. Notably, B3 disclosed that the demand for Bitcoin futures on its exchange was so profound that it had hit 111,000 buy or sell orders on the trading screen. The market had displayed intense participation in the newly launched contracts, with the Director of Listed Products at B3, Marcos Skistymas, affirming that the heightened demand resulted from B3\u2019s introduction of its first-ever derivative linked to a cryptocurrency. The introduction of Bitcoin futures marks a significant step forward for the stock exchange, aligning with its vision to expand its offerings to cater to users\u2019 needs. Skistymas has also indicated that the market\u2019s response to the recently listed Bitcoin futures was overwhelmingly positive, reflecting a significant potential for these contracts within the Brazilian market. BTC Futures To Act As A Hedge Against Market Volatility According to Skistymas, Bitcoin futures were a \u201csuitable instrument\u201d that could become a hedge against Bitcoin, potentially providing Brazilian investors a means to manage the flurry of risks associated with Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations. For more clarity, a Bitcoin future is a contract between investors who wager on the future price of the pioneer cryptocurrency, providing exposure to Bitcoin without the need to purchase it. Given btc\u2019s high volatility and price fluctuations during certain market conditions, accurately predicting the price of the cryptocurrency can be challenging. Additionally, only a handful of crypto analysts and investors have managed to forecast Bitcoin\u2019s price actions with precision. At the beginning of the year, the price of BTC surged from below $50,000 to an all-time high of more than $75,000 in March 2024. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $66,129 after witnessing a major price correction and plummeting by 0.09% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap.

The analysis, conducted on a monthly time frame, reveals that XRP has been holding above a critical support trend marked in blue. With the crypto community\u2019s eyes set on the new Ripple filings expected next week, there\u2019s a mix of anticipation and caution. XRP Price Enters Potentially Crucial Week Dark Defender notes that although market news does not typically have a direct correlation with price movements, the \u201clast puzzle piece\u201d pertaining to the Ripple case may add a layer of enthusiasm to the market sentiment surrounding XRP. The question posed is: What could happen if XRP fails to maintain its position above the blue support line? According to the analysis, if XRP breaks below this blue support line, it will likely approach the two critical Fibonacci retracement levels at $0.4623 (38.2% retracement level) and $0.3917 (23.6% retracement level). These figures are derived from the swing high and low points on the chart, traditionally considered potential support levels where the price could stabilize or bounce back. In the context of the current chart, a drop below these levels, particularly if the price closes under $0.3917 for two to three days consecutively, would invalidate the bullish five-wave structure that Dark Defender suggests could propel XRP to a high of $5.85. On the flip side, should XRP reclaim the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.6044, it could signify a first step towards a strong upward move. Between the price range of $0.6649 and $0.3917, any price movement is considered a sideways trend. A breakout above the 70.2% level at $0.6649 would likely confirm a bullish trend, with the analyst highlighting this as a significant threshold for a positive price trajectory. Above this level, XRP would then eye the next Fibonacci extension levels of $1.8815 (161.8% extension) and potentially $5.8563 (261.8% extension), which are ambitiously projected targets. The chart also highlights a \u201cMain Resistance Trend\u201d line that has capped the price since the peak of early 2018, and the current price action is pinched between this descending resistance and the ascending support trend lines, forming a converging pattern that traders often interpret as a potential breakout signal. A breakout could be the first bullish indication of a larger rally, with at least one monthly close above the line required. In the past, several attempts at a breakout have failed, and even one monthly close was followed by a fall back below the trendline the following month. Ripple Vs. SEC: What To Expect This Week Ripple Labs is gearing up to file its response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) remedies briefing on April 22, a pivotal moment in their protracted legal battle. This response from Ripple is in reaction to the SEC\u2019s briefing that put forth potential remedies including disgorgement of profits derived from XRP sales and civil penalties. The financial stakes are high, with the SEC calculating fines that could reach around $2 billion, claiming that Ripple engaged in an unregistered securities offering with its XRP sales. The legal and financial communities expect Ripple to mount a formidable defense against the SEC\u2019s claims. Key to this counter-argument will be undermining the SEC\u2019s assertion of the necessity for disgorgement, given the alleged lack of demonstrable financial harm to XRP purchasers. Furthermore, Ripple is likely to leverage favorable recent legal decisions and regulatory developments, aiming to weaken the SEC\u2019s position. According to the schedule, Ripple is expected to submit a public redacted version of its opposition brief along with associated declarations and exhibits today, if these materials are devoid of any SEC-designated confidential information. If confidentiality is a concern, Ripple will file the documents under seal and submit a redacted public version by April 24. Following this, the SEC will have the opportunity to reply, with their response anticipated to be filed under seal by May 6.

However, a storm of accusations paints a grim picture, suggesting ZKasino might be nothing more than a meticulously crafted house of cards ready to crumble. ZKasino Accused Of Diverting Funds And Deceiving Investors Trouble began brewing for ZKasino in March when ZigZag, a rival decentralized exchange, leveled serious accusations. ZigZag claims ZKasino not only lied about its funding but also diverted funds meant for development into personal pockets. The accusations don\u2019t end there. ZKasino allegedly failed to pay contractors who helped build the platform, further eroding trust. I\u2019m gonna lay this out since it gets worse and worse everyday. Multiple people have approached me in the past week with allegations that the @ZKasino_io team owes them money or defrauded them in some way. Multiple former employees and contractors have contacted me to let me\u2026 \u2014 ZigZag Exchange (@ZigZagExchange) March 23, 2024 These allegations gained traction when ZKasino users voiced concerns about a broken promise. Initially, ZKasino promised users the ability to withdraw their bridged Ethereum (a process allowing Ethereum to be used on other blockchains) 1:1. However, upon launch, users discovered their funds were locked in ZKasino\u2019s token ($ZKAS) with a 15-month vesting period. This move fueled speculation that ZKasino was engaged in a \u201crug pull,\u201d a notorious crypto scam where developers abandon a project after taking user funds. Crypto Investors Scramble To Distance Themselves From ZKasino The weight of these accusations proved too much for some of ZKasino\u2019s initial supporters. MEXC, a major crypto exchange that participated in ZKasino\u2019s funding round at a hefty $350 million valuation, distanced itself from the project. In a public statement, MEXC claimed it was unaware of any potential rug pull and considered itself another victim of ZKasino\u2019s alleged deception. Another investor, Big Brain Holdings, echoed MEXC\u2019s sentiment. While Big Brain Holdings didn\u2019t directly invest in ZKasino, they had invested in ZigZag back in 2022. They allege that several former ZigZag founders are now part of the ZKasino team, a fact they now see as a red flag. Big Brain Holdings stated they would not accept their offered token distribution from ZKasino and expect other investors to follow suit. Speculations Of A Rug Pull The evidence against ZKasino paints a troubling picture. ZigZag\u2019s claims, coupled with broken promises and investor backtracking, raise serious concerns about the project\u2019s legitimacy. While ZKasino has yet to respond to the accusations, the silence only fuels speculation of a rug pull.

Unlike prior transactions, this batch of Solana tokens will be sold through an auction process, a departure from the fixed-price sales previously conducted. According to Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Markets, a decentralized financial services firm, the estate will reveal the exact details of the auction today. The decision to opt for an auction rather than a fixed-price sale reflects a strategic pivot designed to potentially maximize returns for the estate\u2019s creditors. How Much Are The Solana Tokens Selling For This Time? The last transaction involving Solana tokens by the FTX estate brought in $1.9 billion, with the tokens priced at approximately $64 each, in stark contrast to Solana\u2019s current market value of around $150, representing a 67% discount to its market value at the time. As FTX disclosed in the summer of 2023, the bankrupt crypto exchange held $1.2 billion in Solana as at August 31, 2023. SOL was at $20 at the time. Figure Markets, led by Cagney, is organizing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to allow a broader range of investors to participate in the auction. This SPV will be open to non-US investors and accredited US investors, aiming to consolidate and amplify bidding power. Cagney\u2019s announcement on X (formerly Twitter) serves both as a call to action and an invitation: \u201cJust got confirmation that the next round of locked Solana coins from the FTX estate will be an auction, with exact details coming Monday. If you want in, join us.\u201d Cagney added in another post on X, \u201cOk \u2013 are you an FTX creditor upset about the SOL sales? Or you aren\u2019t a creditor, but still think the last sales went way too cheap? Well, now you can do something about it.\u201d This initiative not only opens up financial opportunities for investors but also provides a platform for affected parties to influence the outcome of the asset liquidation process actively.

The nature of these tokens, being locked, means they cannot be sold until a specified future date, adding a layer of risk and potential reward that appears to have attracted strong investor interest. At press time, the Solana share price was -27% below its high for the year of $210.

The forum interviewed and recognized the contribution of multiple blockchain-powered companies and their CEOs. It also invited hundreds of young project owners and allowed them to connect with VC Funds. Several industry experts discussed key challenges and opportunities in the blockchain space. Let\u2019s take a look at insights from some of the speakers. Key Insights From Blockchain Life 2024 in Dubai Lennix Lai Chief Commercial Officer OKX Okx\u2019s Education Initiative to Support Derivative Traders On the question of how OKX is helping derivative traders execute successful trades, Lai says their first goal is to help minimize the persistent educational gap. This gap is minimized by the introduction of easy-to-understand courses on trading. Lai says OKX understands derivatives are, by nature, relatively niche-oriented and are highly leveraged. This means that it is relatively riskier than other forms of trading. Therefore, to minimize this risk, OKX puts extra effort into educating their users so their capital is protected against at least avoidable losses. Secondly, OKX also puts extra effort into simplifying the User Experience and Interface, thereby ensuring the process of executing trades is as simple as it can be. Regulations and OKX When asked how OKX responds to the shifting nature of crypto regulations, Lai says it is challenging because all countries offer different types of regulations. Therefore, it does not mean \u201cone size fits all\u201d when it comes to responding to regulations; you have to work with the authorities to come up with a solution. As a result, it is a very time-consuming process, but it\u2019s a process that OKX is prepared for and has a lot of data that it can share with regulators to come to a settlement. So, regulations cannot speed up; they will take their course to be completed, and OKX is prepared to do whatever it takes to reach a successful dialogue between the stakeholders. Importance of Altcoin Options Market for OKX On the question of how big the altcoin options market is right now, Lai says that while the importance of Bitcoin cannot be overruled, the altcoin market is also becoming stronger. In fact, at the current status, the liquidity market status of altcoins is sufficient, and as far as their trading on OKX is concerned, their trade execution comprises a fair number. But in the coming years, it is difficult to project because a lot of altcoin trading happens in a two-way bilateral agreement instead of trading on exchanges. So, considering this, the current underlying altcoin options market is sufficient and has room for growth in the coming years. Ben Zhou Chief Executive Officer Bybit The Reason Behind 2024\u2019s Bull Run During the discussion, Zhou was asked what his views were about the latest bull run, which started in February. As per Zhou, one of the leading driving forces behind this bull market is institutional money, which started to flow once there was clarity from the regulators. As institutions started to enter, others followed and entered the space they previously did not. Therefore, the main driving force is the institutions, and the second reason includes the development of financial infrastructure, which was completed after the fall of FTX because earlier, there simply was not any appropriate infrastructure for institutions to enter the space. Good infrastructure means improvement not only in exchange improvement but also in risk management and system resilience. Considering this, the current bull run had all the reasons to come into effect, and so it did. Future of Bybit in Light of European Restrictions When asked about the upcoming MiCA regulations impact on Bybit, Zhou said it is going to be an industry thing which means not only Bybit will be impacted but all the other platforms as well. The MiCA regulations will start to effect at the end of this year. To overcome this, Bybit\u2019s first step is to seek licenses in different parts of the world, which is why we have already applied for a license in Hong Kong. Furthermore, Bybit\u2019s next step is to build web3 products, which is also something many other platforms are doing, including OKX and Binance. This will allow European users to explore different options that Web3 offers in general, and for that, Bybit will offer a self-custody wallet. These self-custody wallets will offer a lot of things that are relevant to web3. Derivatives Market and Bybit When asked how Bybit sees the derivatives market and its role as the leader in the coming two to three years, Zhou says the biggest challenge is liquidity. This is because it is now not very difficult to build a product that is comparatively easy to use. However, the main problem starts with liquidity, and users only come to top exchanges because they provide liquidity to users, which means more security for their assets. To become one of the top exchanges, Bybit is working on shortening the latency, which helps us to become more institutional grade and, therefore in return, helps us to grow our liquidity. Vivien Lin Chief Product Officer BingX Award Best Crypto Exchange Blockchain Technology Beyond Trading On the question of what role blockchain technology can play beyond trading, Vivien said there is a lot of room for blockchain technology or Web 3 as a whole in the entire space. Vivien said blockchain technology should not be viewed as just Bitcoin or something that supports trading. There is a lot of technological advancement happening in the space of AI. Crypto can be a force of good as it can help to form more meaningful and real-life implementations. Apart from this, the whole gaming sector, or GameFi, is another example of how blockchain technology is used in ways other than trading. With the help of blockchain technology, the world of gaming is not just for entertainment; it also provides real-life use cases in the form of NFTs. Implementation of Web 3 Technology by BingX When asked how BingX implements new Web 3 technology on its platform that has a growing user demand, Vivien said BingX is constantly looking at growing Web 3 projects that its users are enjoying. BingX has an entire research team that focuses on what kind of Web 3 projects should be adopted that will complement the platform. BingX is working with a lot of developers and other project owners to increase its listing services. So as a whole, depending on the user and community requirements, BingX sees itself as someone responsible for bringing those projects to the masses. From another angle, this also helps to improve the overall prosperity of the industry. How BingX Ensures User Safety When asked how BingX ensures the user\u2019s safety in light of growing cyber threats, Vivien said BingX is adopting AI technology that monitors the platform against any suspicious activity. The AI is trained in threat detection and before anything goes wrong, it will alert us, and from there, experts can take over. This is done because BingX is not a very big company; it has over 400 employees, so considering this it is nearly impossible to spread out all the resources. Therefore, by adopting a third-party technology service solution, which in this case is a smart AI, that does the job really well for us and as the model is constantly learning from the entire industry, it will only improve. Jeremy Firster Global Head of Enterprise Cardano Foundation Award Best Layer-1 Solution Jeremy\u2019s Experience at the Cardano Foundation Jeremy was asked about his role at the Cardano Foundation and what potential he believes Cardano has in the coming years, especially as its mission is to support developers. As per Jeremy, his main job is to lead utility with the real-world industries and understand the underlying frameworks that help Web 2 to function. By monitoring their frameworks, Jeremy helps to understand and work towards how those frameworks can be included within the Web 3 applications and blockchain technology in general. Jeremy believes that as more and more applications coincide between Web 2 and Web 3, the growth is likely to be incredible. Regulatory Space of Web3 During the panel, regulatory space was discussed between Jeremy and other panelists, with the main question being where the space is headed in the coming years in terms of regulations. One of the biggest reasons behind the US taking a strict stance over cryptocurrencies is that securities regulations are having a difficult time understanding the crypto world as a whole. The main reason is the whole ICO mania way back in 2016, where no one knew where things fell and under whose jurisdiction. While this is not the case anymore, as there is some clarity on what powers SEC has, however, the biggest issue is that the US Senator and Mr Gensler want to kill the technology altogether as they want to nationalize the financial supply. So, at the moment, the main challenge is not the laws but the people who are making those laws. Which is also a reason why the future is bleak. Charmaine Lim Head of VIP Client Services HTX Growth of HTX in Different Countries During the discussion, Charmaine was first asked which countries HTX is looking forward to growing its business while also remaining compliant with the local regulations. According to Charmaine, HTX has already registered for an FMP license to operate in Dubai and is working to ensure it remains aligned with MiCA regulations in Europe. Both these initiatives guarantee that HTX continues to lead together with other exchanges while also ensuring it provides true secure services. Furthermore, as per Charmaine, HTX is also constantly looking toward other potential markets; however, as regulations are not clear in most parts of the world, it is difficult to work with the regulators and be certain. How HTX Is Ensuring User Security On the question of how HTX is ensuring the security of users\u2019 assets, Charmaine said the first thing is the development of our reserve, which acts as insurance in case things go sideways. Despite the fact that a breach has never happened before with HTX due to powerful and up-to-date security measures. Having a reserve guarantees that if things somehow manage to go wrong, HTX will still have more funds to make sure that none of its customers suffer. Regardless, at the end of the day, this ensures peace of mind, which is very important to users. For large volume traders of HTX who often decide to work with third-party custodial services, HTX has already integrated with fire blocks and is continuously working with partners alike to bring such services. Also, HTX welcomes those who feel safer using third-party custodial services and want to integrate with HTX for trading, as we are happy to connect and meet the requirements. HTX vs Decentralized Finance: The Future When asked how a centralized exchange like HTX compares with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the future, Charmaine said it is not a competition between the two rather, there should be some form of partnership. As opposed to what many think, centralized exchanges, in general, should coexist with decentralized finance because when both grow together, the potential is immense. Therefore, there should not be any competition between the two rather, customers should be given these two choices and they should choose the best for themselves based on what suits them the most. Doing so will allow both sectors to grow together and help bridge the gap that exists between traditional and decentralized finance. Sebastien Badault Vice President Ledger Web3 and Freedom When asked how Web3 guarantees freedom, Sebastien said one of the biggest freedoms that Web3 brings is the freedom to do things that you want to. Because at the end of the day, no person or entity is going to ask you why you send your $2k to someone because there is no one controlling Web3 other than the community. According to Sebastien, this is perhaps one of the biggest reasons why, despite all of the reasons, Web3 is still here because there are genuine people who believe in its mission and power to change the world. Sure, some people want to make money out of it, but there is indeed a good chunk of people who want freedom, which is why Web 3 is a force to reckon with. Importance for Scalability On the question of what\u2019s the most important thing for the future development of Web 3\u2019s adoption, Sebastien said it\u2019s all about scalability and that is also something Ledger is working on. It is important to note that scalability is the reason why assets can move incredibly fast and also cheaply. Without that, it is almost impossible for institutions to adopt cryptocurrencies. If that does not happen, there simply will be no more ETFs. Therefore, the biggest challenge right now is to make sure the entire ecosystem is scalable so users from around the globe can truly feel they are part of the magic and the blockchain revolution. Future of Security Through Regulation vs Technical Availability On the question of how Sebastien views the growing adoption of ETFs, which does not give users power over their Bitcoin or Ethereum but rather gives them governmental security. As per Sebastien, having ETFs is in itself a great way forward, however, it is unclear what the future holds. One can argue that there will come a time when exchanges will start to offer them, and their users will move towards self-custody. So, there is a good chance that it will be a journey because people will realize the main power of an ETF is not that institutions offer them but rather the freedom of truly owning them yourself. But at the moment, it is a bit complicated, and with time, perhaps things will move in a different direction because, eventually, you need hardware wallets to secure your funds. Final Thoughts of the 2024 Blockchain Life Awards in Dubai With the 2024 Blockchain Life Awards coming to a close in Dubai, it was evident that the event had done more than just honor the accomplishments and innovations of current blockchain industry heavyweights; it had also laid the groundwork for what\u2019s to come in Web3, cryptocurrency, and mining. From Ben Zhou\u2019s bull run analysis to Charmaine Lim\u2019s user security strategies, the insights shared by industry experts highlight a dynamic industry that is ready for significant growth and transformation in the future.

As the halving reduces the rate of Bitcoin supply growth by 50%, miners are confronted with soaring operational costs, prompting some to consider alternative revenue streams such as artificial intelligence (AI). Post-Halving Spike: Bitcoin Mining Costs to Reach $53,000 The report highlights a nearly doubling of mining costs, projecting that the average cash cost of production will jump from $29,500 to approximately $53,000 per Bitcoin. Similarly, it expects electricity costs to rise from $16,300 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $34,900 per Bitcoin mined post-halving. These increased expenses are driving mining companies to explore more economically viable options. Companies like BitDigital, Hive, and Hut 8 have already begun to generate income from AI technologies, leveraging their computational capabilities beyond cryptocurrency mining. CoinShares points out that TeraWulf and Core Scientific are not only active in the sector but are also planning to expand their AI operations. \u201cCompanies like TeraWulf and Bitdeer are actively expanding their capacities. Core Scientific, for instance, is hosting Coreweave under a multi-year contract. At the same time, BitDigital plans to double its capacity, aiming to reach an estimated annual run rate of approximately $100 million.\u201d The report states. Read More: What Is Bitcoin Halving? Miners Adapt to Halving: New Focus on Stranded Energy and AI Tech James Butterfill, lead author of the CoinShares report, suggests that Bitcoin mining operations might gravitate towards locations with stranded energy resources. At the same time, investment in AI could proliferate in more stable environments. This strategic shift could help mitigate the financial strain caused by the halving as miners seek to optimize energy costs, enhance mining efficiency, and invest in cost-effective hardware. Fluctuations in the hashrate\u2014the combined computational power used in mining and processing Bitcoin transactions\u2014further complicate the mining landscape. Post-halving forecasts predict that the hashrate will eventually climb to 700 exahash by 2025, although an immediate 10% drop is expected as less profitable mining operations go offline. Concurrently, we anticipate that hash prices, which reflect the earnings per unit of hashrate, will decline. Bitcoin Hashrate Prediction Chart.

A few Bitcoiners have now launched efforts at a referendum to make a small adjustment to Switzerland\u2019s constitution to add Bitcoin reserves to Gold. Bitcoin in Swiss National Reserves According to a local news report from Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ), the constitution states that the Swiss National Bank creates currency reserves from its income, and holds a part of it in Gold. A non-profit think tank, 2B4CH, now wants the relevant constitutional article to read \u201cGold and Bitcoin\u201d. 2B4CH founder and chairman Yves Bennaïm said the organization is already hard at work: \u201cWe are in the process of completing the organizational preparations for the committee and preparing the documents that must be submitted to the State Chancellery in order to start the process.\u201d To achieve any success, 2B4CH must get 100,000 signatures from citizens within 18 months before a referendum is held. This is not the think tank\u2019s first attempt at lobbying the SNB to hold reserves in Bitcoin. In 2021, 2B4CH launched the initiative in a thread posted on X (formerly Twitter), looking to amend Article 99 Clause 3 of the Federal Constitution. At the time, 2B4CH noted that it was not \u201ctoo optimistic about getting a law actually passed\u201d. However, it hoped to get 100k signatures to open a public conversation and debate. Switzerland Would Have Been $32 Billion Richer According to Luzius Meisser, President of Bitcoin trading platform Bitcoin Suisse, the move would allow Switzerland to operate independently of the European Central Bank (ECB). Meisser is currently helping Bennaïm with the initiative and will have 3 minutes to plead their case before the SNB at an April 26 meeting. The NZZ report states that Meisser previously asked the SNB to buy 1 billion Swiss francs a month at the 2022 general meeting. According to him, Switzerland would be richer by $32.9 billion (30 billion Swiss francs) if it had taken Meisser\u2019s advice. The Bitcoin Suisse President is now saying that delaying this move would be detrimental to Switzerland. According to him, other central banks will set their eyes on Bitcoin and buy the asset. This will force Switzerland to eventually buy Bitcoin at much higher prices. Bennaïm and Meisser\u2019s efforts are significantly creating awareness for Bitcoin and its potential uses. Even if the current attempt fails again, the efforts, including Meisser\u2019s upcoming SNB speech, are strong enough to keep the conversation going for a while. In 2022, the SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said at its general meeting that \u201cwe do not believe Bitcoin meets the requirements of currency reserves. That\u2019s why we have until now decided not to have Bitcoin on our balance sheet\u201d. Otherwise, \u201cbuying Bitcoin is not a problem for us. We can do that either directly or can buy investment products which are based on Bitcoin,\u201d said he. next Swiss Bitcoin Bulls to Lobby Central Bank to Include BTC in National Reserves","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Swiss Bitcoin Bulls to Lobby Central Bank to Include BTC in National Reserves A Swiss non-profit group is making a second attempt to convince the central bank to add Bitcoin to its national reserves.

The analyst chudnov on the X platform stated that an imminent yield crisis on the EigenLayer could potentially cause revenue to \u201cfall off a cliff\u201d. Looming Threats on EigenLayer While EigenLayer\u2019s Token-Locking contract boasts an impressive $15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), the analyst noted that the Actively Validated Service (AVS) required to secure the network will require only 10% of this amount. The EigenLayer protocol is an Ethereum (ETH)-based project that aims to improve the network\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus using a method known as restaking. The EigenLayer team claims to have solved several of Ethereum\u2019s security inefficiencies and a recent report reveals that the protocol boasts more than $13 billion in user deposits. However, chudnov expressed concern that opening the door to over $15 billion in deposits could be too much for the network to handle. He emphasized that this could lead to a yield crisis, where the supply outstrips the available demand, resulting in a downward pressure on prices. The analyst\u2019s argument is centered on the discrepancy between the amount of ETH deposited through EigenLayer\u2019s LRT (Liquidity-Restaking Token) and the actual security needs of the AVS nodes. Although the deposited ETH is delegated to node operators to secure the AVS and earn rewards, the analyst questions whether any of these AVS nodes need large amounts of ETH being deposited for security. As an example, he cited EigenDA and Lagrange, two services developed on top of Ethereum using the EigenLayer primitives that require less capital than $1.5 billion of security. 7/ So, what is the solution? There are two ways (not mutually exclusive): 1. bottom-up 2. top-down \u2014 chudnov (@chudnovglavniy) April 22, 2024 The Way Forward for EigenLayer The analyst proposed two potential remedies to EigenLayer\u2019s yield crisis: a bottom-up and a top-down strategy. The analyst\u2019s bottom-up approach suggests that there may be an attempt to artificially create a market for ETH by incentivizing the creation of \u201cshitcoins\u201d that, in turn, require a larger security budget. According to the analyst, this approach would effectively transform EigenLayer into a pass-through mechanism for a pool of airdrops without any real utility for the deposited ETH. On the other hand, the top-down approach involves the Eigenlayer team developing financial tools on top of the existing restaking mechanisms within EigenLayer to offset the opportunity costs associated with holding restaked ETH. The analyst argues that EigenLayer could potentially reduce the burden on the AVS security budget by creating additional financial products and services on top of the existing infrastructure, such as money markets or derivatives. This approach combines financial innovation to drive sustainable and organic growth for EigenLayer. The analyst is tilted toward the first approach but highlights that it may not be a sustainable one because artificially inflating tokenomics and creating \u201cartificial security demand\u201d can be a short-term solution. He points out that the token prices can suffer if the alt market takes a hit and the excess capital held by the AVS nodes might not be efficiently allocated if the security budget is overestimated. next EigenLayer Is Facing Major Yield Crisis, Analyst Explains Why","article_summary":"Coinspeaker EigenLayer Is Facing Major Yield Crisis, Analyst Explains Why The analyst proposed two potential remedies to EigenLayer's yield crisis: a bottom-up and a top-down strategy.

This move aims to streamline trading operations and facilitate more efficient price discovery across various cryptocurrency markets. Targeted Crypto Assets and Step Size Modification The step size adjustment will impact a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, including Fetch.ai (FET), Injective (INJ), Solana (SOL), and Celestia (TIA). Step size, a crucial trading parameter, defines the smallest intervals at which an order\u2019s quantity can be adjusted. By making adjustments to these increments, Binance aims to create a smoother and more liquid trading environment for these digital assets. According to the announcement, the step size updates will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, scheduled for April 29, 2024, at 05:00 UTC, will target trading pairs involving FET and INJ. In this phase, the step size for pairs such as FET/BNB, FET/BTC, and INJ/USDT will be changed to make order execution more precise. The second phase, slated the same day but at a different hour, at 07:00 UTC, will focus on SOL and TIA trading pairs. Pairs such as SOL/BNB, SOL/USDT, and TIA/BTC will undergo step size modifications, enabling traders to place orders with greater precision and potentially enhancing market depth. The platform provided a table detailing the specific changes to the step sizes for each affected trading pair. The step size for the FET/BNB pair will decrease from 1 to 0.1, allowing for more precise order placement. Similarly, the INJ/BTC pair\u2019s step size will be reduced from 0.1 to 0.01. More so, the SOL pairs involving currencies such as BNB, BTC, and EUR, among others, will change from 0.01 to 0.001. Effect of the Update on Spot Trading on Binance The exchange has assured traders that these adjustments will not disrupt ongoing spot trading or other related functionalities. Existing spot orders placed before the step size update will continue to be matched with the original step size, ensuring a smooth trading environment for active traders on the platform. To accommodate the changes, the exchange has urged traders to reassess their trading strategies and adjust accordingly. The platform acknowledged the potential inconvenience caused by these modifications and expressed its commitment to minimizing disruptions during the transition period. For developers and traders relying on Binance\u2019s Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the step size information will also be updated. They will be able to access the latest step size data through the provided link. The step-size adjustments further reveal Binance\u2019s continuous effort toward fostering a smooth and improved trading environment for its vast user base. This latest improvement will provide traders with greater control over their order executions, enhancing their trading capabilities and potentially opening more profitable opportunities within the FET, INJ, SOL, and TIA markets on Binance\u2019s platform. next Binance Releases Update on Step Size Adjustment on Spot Trading Pairs","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Binance Releases Update on Step Size Adjustment on Spot Trading Pairs Binance has assured users that these adjustments will not disrupt ongoing spot trading or other related functionalities.

Martha","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker Jesse Pollak Foresees Meme Coins as Key to Base\u2019s Growth Jesse Pollak, one of the brains behind the development of Coinbase layer-2 scaling solution Base, said meme coins would be the primary driver of new users to the Ethereum-based protocol. Speaking at a hackathon event over the weekend in New York, Pollak highlighted the significant role memes play in the network\u2019s growth strategy. He also acknowledged that the asset class has brought tremendous success to Base in terms of onboarding so far. \u201cThere\u2019s been a ton of energy on Base. One thing that has really stood out to us is that we\u2019re seeing these memes today onboard thousands and thousands of people into this new economy,\u201d he said. Bringing the World On-chain Pollak believes that memes are an important aspect of the crypto economy, and the layer-2 protocol aims to bring the world on-chain. He further noted that apart from serving as a speculative tool, meme creators on the protocol are actively exploring innovative ways to attract new users into their communities. As a result of their continuous efforts to creatively engage and onboard more individuals, the Base creator believes the asset class will be instrumental in bringing in millions of new users to Base in the coming years. \u201cThe thing we\u2019ve built more conviction on is that in the years ahead, we\u2019re actually going to see these memes bring in millions more people [to Base] \u2014 they\u2019re going to be one of the biggest drivers because they\u2019re doing that work constantly to onboard more and more folks through that in a really creative way,\u201d said Pollak. Top Meme Projects on Base Pollak further disclosed that hundreds of meme projects and developers are currently evolving, building, and creating to bring their culture and energy into the Base economy as well as the capital market. According to data from CoinGecko, BRETT is currently the leading memecoin on Base, boasting a market capitalization of $567 million. Since the beginning of March, the token has experienced a price surge of 7,780%. Other top meme projects on the layer-2 blockchain after BRETT are DEGEN, with a market cap of $435 million, and TOSHI, with a market cap of $185 million. Milestone Achievements In less than a year of launch, Base has achieved a series of milestones and is currently ranked among Ethereum\u2019s top five scaling solutions. Last month, the protocol recorded $356 million in transactions within 24 hours. Activities on the network continued to surge after the Ethereum Dencun upgrade in mid-March, which reduced fees for layer-2 networks. According to Web3 firm DefiLlama, Base\u2019s total value locked (TVL) continued to rise, reaching an all-time high of $1.65 billion on April 21. The figure shows a 250% increase since the beginning of March 2024. Earlier this month, the network achieved another milestone by processing between 300 and 400 transactions per second (TPS) for the first time since its launch. next Jesse Pollak Foresees Meme Coins as Key to Base\u2019s Growth","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Jesse Pollak Foresees Meme Coins as Key to Base\u2019s Growth Pollak disclosed that hundreds of meme projects and developers are currently evolving, building, and creating to bring their culture and energy into the Base economy as well as the capital market.

According to the data from YCharts, the average fee per transaction plunged from an all-time high of $128.45 down to a more reasonable $34.80. The initial surge in transactions seems connected to the release of Runes protocol, created by Casey Rodarmor. Runes is similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. Its launch triggered a frenzy of activity as users rushed to make rune-based meme coins. However, this sudden surge in activity congested the network, causing transaction fees to skyrocket. Bitcoin Transaction Fees See $81 Million Spike The Bitcoin network experienced a significant surge in total transaction fees, reflecting a notable trend. According to data from YCharts, the fees skyrocketed from $7.7 million on April 19 to a remarkable $81 million on the 20th, amid the halving event and the Runes launch. However, the fees subsequently decreased to $22.37 million on the 21, highlighting potential scalability challenges within the network. While the Runes launch initially led to a surge in fees, it remains uncertain whether this represents a long-term, sustainable source of revenue for miners. However, some anticipated Runes would become a significant fee generator; early signs suggest otherwise. For example, the floor prices for Runestone NFT items dropped nearly 50% within one day as of April 21, according to Magic Eden. However, the situation is not entirely unfavorable for cryptocurrency miners. Ordinal collections like Bitcoin Pullets and NodeMonkes, which generate fees from transactions, have experienced price increases during the same timeframe. This suggests a potential future where various digital assets, not only traditional transactions, contribute to the revenue earned by miners. Grayscale Predicts Bitcoin\u2019s Path to $10 Trillion Market Cap Despite the short-term challenges, industry experts believe these events reveal Bitcoin mining\u2019s economic future. Grayscale, the manager of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), says if transaction charges stabilize at a higher rate than historically observed, future halvings\u2019 impact on miner revenue will diminish. Looking decades ahead, Bitcoin\u2019s total worth may inflate to $10 trillion and network traffic soars, so transaction fees could build a significant income for miners. However, achieving such scalability and widespread adoption will require ongoing development efforts and innovative approaches to mitigate network congestion. \u201cA preview of what\u2019s to come in Bitcoin mining economics decades from now, as Bitcoin monetizes into a $10 trillion+ asset, demand for the network is orders of magnitude larger than today, and we\u2019ve had a few more halvings,\u201d said Grayscale. next Bitcoin Transaction Fees Plummet after Record High during BTC Halving Event 2024","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Bitcoin Transaction Fees Plummet after Record High during BTC Halving Event 2024 While the Runes launch initially led to a surge in fees, it remains uncertain whether this represents a long-term, sustainable source of revenue for miners.

The last SOL token sale by FTX attracted significant buyer interest. Figure Markets confirms it will participate in the auction. The embattled FTX cryptocurrency exchange is set to auction the remaining locked Solana (SOL) tokens from its estate. The decision follows the success of the previous sale, which generated significant interest from buyers. The upcoming auction has been confirmed by Mike Cagney, the CEO of Figure Markets and board chair of Figure, who disclosed that the decentralized exchange will take part in the auction. Figure Markets introduces SPV investment opportunity To facilitate Figure Markets\u2019 participation in the upcoming SOL auctions from the FTX estate, Figure Markets has unveiled a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) open to non-US investors (subject to KYC) and accredited US investors. The SPV will operate based on community consensus, where each dollar invested equals one vote in determining bid prices and subsequent management decisions. Investors interested in participating in the SPV can do so using USD, USDC, BTC, or ETH. Figure Markets will charge a 50 bps annual management fee to cover the costs of setting up the SPV and ongoing management. Additionally, while there\u2019s no confirmed timeline yet, Figure Markets intends to integrate the SPV into their exchange, allowing investors to use their investment as collateral for borrowing and margining. By offering this investment opportunity, Figure Markets aims to provide investors with a streamlined way to participate in the auction of locked Solana tokens from the FTX estate. With the SPV structure, investors can have a say in bid prices and subsequent management decisions, creating a community-driven approach to investment in the cryptocurrency space. FTX\u2019s previous Solana (SOL) token sale The success of FTX\u2019s previous SOL token sale to industry giants like Pantera and Galaxy Digital cannot be understated. With approximately $2.6 billion generated from selling two-thirds of its locked Solana tokens at around $60 per token, the FTX estate made significant gains from the sale. For the investors, considering Solana\u2019s current price hovering around $153, the decision to buy in previous Solana sales appears to have been a prudent one. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies calls for careful consideration and risk management especially seeing that the unlocking of huge amounts of tokens could create a surplus in supply and unless the demand goes through the roof, the token price could plummet.

The company is licensed by the world's largest supervisory commissions, including the UK's FCA and the US's SEC and FINRA. However, it has no authorizations on the Old Continent, which the Cypriot CySEC has decided to draw attention to. Doo Financial Without Regulation in Cyprus and EU Doo Financial is part of the Singapore-based financial group called Doo Group, which was founded in 2014. Although the company has licenses issued by many global regulators, including in the European financial center, London, it currently does not offer licensed services within the European Union. However, clients from Europe have the option to register accounts with Doo Financial, which has led to its inclusion on the CySEC warning list published earlier this week. In addition to Doo Financial, the latest list includes a dozen other entities, including one unlicensed prop trading firm and a standard mix of FX/CFD brokers and cryptocurrency companies. \"CySEC urges investors to consult its website (www.cysec.gov.cy), before conducting business with investment firms, in order to ascertain the entities, which are licensed to provide investment services and/or investment activities,\" the regulator commented. According to the CySEC document, the warning list has been updated with the following website addresses: fundednowprop.com fiat-global.com & platform.fiatfxtrade.com buxmapps.com actaswiss.com trader-trust.eu fpmhelenic.com & client.clients-area.com/register doofinancial.com wallstreet-fx.io fidelitycfd.com & wt.fidelitycfd.com vstarsoho.net alfacapitalmarket.com forexelite.co & forexelite.trade/private Finance Magnates has requested a comment from Doo Financial, and the article will be updated once a response is received. For CySEC, this is another regulatory action following last week's decision by the regulator to extend the suspension of the license of the bankrupt exchange FTX until September of this year. The original suspension was issued in November 2022. Doo Expands, but in Other Parts of the World Doo Financial is currently focusing on markets outside of the Old Continent, as evidenced by recent decisions related to further business development. In mid-March, Doo Financial HK Limited, a subsidiary of the Doo Group specializing in providing CFDs for retail traders, obtained the Type 1 (Dealing in Securities) License from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Just a week later, Doo Capital Market SG Pte. Ltd. (DCM), another subsidiary under Doo Financial, received approval for a Capital Markets Services (CMS) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This milestone marks a significant step forward in the company's operations, allowing it to strengthen its presence in the Southeast Asian financial hub. Earlier this year, Doo Group entered the Middle East market by opening a new office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This strategic move demonstrates the group's commitment to expanding its global footprint and tapping into the region's growing demand for financial services. While Doo Financial continues to develop its operations in Asia and the Middle East, its lack of regulatory authorization in Europe, particularly from CySEC, may limit its ability to serve clients in the region effectively.

Over the course of the series we\u2019ve presented a range of tools designed to improve how you use this incredibly powerful tool. The series was written after I took an online course on prompt engineering. I\u2019m stepping away from it now. While it offers a range of tools from video creation to time management assistance, I\u2019ve got what I needed: A much better understanding of how to write prompts within ChatGPT. Here\u2019s part one in the series, part two, part three and part four. However, there\u2019s one element that we haven\u2019t touched on at all. And that\u2019s GPTs. What Are GPTs? In addition to the generative, text-based AI ChatGPT, users of ChatGPT 4 can leverage specialized versions of the system to undertake specific tasks. These specialized GPTs are designed to perform beyond text generation, and can do things including audio synthesis, image manipulation, and more. The vast majority have been created by independent developers or companies. Some are free, others are paid. Here's an overview of just some of these specialized areas: Text-to-Speech (TTS) One of the specialized features is text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. GPTs in this niche use a version of the GPT model trained specifically to convert written text into spoken words. Many can generate natural-sounding speech in various accents and tones, making it useful for creating audio content for videos, podcasts, or accessibility features. While voice actors will probably do a better job, this is perhaps great for mockups or trials, or internal training materials. Image Manipulation Another advanced GPT feature is image manipulation. These tools can edit, modify, or generate images based on textual descriptions. They use a model trained to understand and interpret visual information in conjunction with textual descriptions, allowing it to perform tasks such as editing the style of an image, changing specific elements within an image, or creating entirely new images from scratch. ChatGPT 4 users automatically get access to DALL-E, which can generate creative and contextually relevant images based on textual prompts. This is particularly useful for content creators, marketers, and designers who need unique visual content that is tightly aligned with their textual themes. Understanding and Generating Code For developers and programmers, there are GPT models trained to understand and generate code. These models can assist with writing software, debugging, or even learning new programming languages. They can generate code snippets, explain complex code, and suggest improvements or alternatives. Integration in Chat Platforms These specialized GPTs are often integrated directly into ChatGPT, allowing users to interact with the model through a familiar text-based interface. This integration makes it easy to use the capabilities of the model without needing advanced programming knowledge. Advantages of Specialized GPTs Accessibility: They make advanced functionalities accessible to non-specialists. Efficiency: These tools can significantly speed up tasks like content creation, problem-solving, prototyping ideas and image generation. Customization: They can be adapted to meet specific needs or preferences, enhancing their utility across different tasks and industries. Challenges and Considerations Accuracy and Reliability: While powerful, these tools are still being developed and are prone to errors. Everything that an AI program outputs must be carefully checked. Ethical and Creative Considerations: Many people believe that AI images or creations should be labeled as such to avoid confusing people, or potentially distorting information. In addition, great care must be taken to avoid plagiarism, or the spreading of false information. work together with DALL·E to create your perfect image. you can talk to it until you get it just right! https://t.co/RUNuq9Z7JB \u2014 ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) April 3, 2024 Getting Started Here are some of the most interesting GPTs we found.
