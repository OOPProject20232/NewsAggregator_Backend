Concurrently, Injective\u2019s INJ faces a slump despite the launch of its 3.0 upgrade, hinting at a potential end to its long bullish streak. Amidst these uncertainties, BlockDAG emerges as a beacon of promise. With its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph technology, the recent Shibuya keynote and release of its moon-based keynote teaser have positioned BlockDAG not just as a competitor but as a potential leader in blockchain technology, suggesting crypto with 30,000x Potential, ready to redefine industry standards. Evaluating the Ethereum Ecosystem Amidst Declining Gas Usage Recently, Ethereum has seen a decline in gas usage and overall activity, signaling a potential slowdown in its ecosystem.

Despite this, Ethereum\u2019s price saw a modest uptick of 5.61%, with trading figures reaching $3,242.75, possibly driven by increased interest from large-scale investors. While this surge in price might seem positive, it could lead to market manipulation and volatility.

The new governance proposal might stabilize the token\u2019s inflation, but predictions remain cautious given the historical performance and ongoing market correction. INJ might continue to see a volatile market position in the near term, complicating forecasts for its recovery and growth.

Allen","article_detailed_content":"It is important to understand the dynamics of the total loan balance, which is responsible for financial management. Whether a user has a mortgage, student loans, auto loans, personal loans, or credit card debt,. The factors that can increase the total loan balance are varied and significant. Understanding Total Loan Balance The calculation of the total loan balance involves considering multiple factors and the exact method can differ depending on the type of loan. A general overview of the calculation of the loan balance is as follows: Principal Amount It is the initial amount that a user has borrowed. The loan balance starts with the principal. Interest Interest is the cost of borrowing money and is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). The lender applies this interest rate to the outstanding principal balance to calculate the amount of interest. The amount of interest decreases with the decrease in principal. Accrued Interest If a creditor has a loan with compound interest, interest is charged on both the principal and the unpaid interest. For example, if interest is charged on daily compounding, the lender is required to calculate a daily interest amount. Additional fees Some loans come with fees, such as organization fees or late payment fees. These fees can increase total balances. Payments made As the payment is made on the loan, the amount of principal gets reduced, and the remaining payments cover the interest and fees. Missed Payments The failure in payments can lead to an increase in additional fees and interest that increases the total loan balances. Loan term It is the length of a time over which a lender is repaying the loan affects total balance. The longer term increases the total interest payments. Factors to leading in Total Loan Balances Interest rates The type of interest rate that is, fixed or variable and the rate directly affects the amount of interest and loan balance. The higher interest rates can substantially increase the cost of loan over time. Loans with higher interest rates The monthly payments on a higher interest rate loan include a higher interest component and leads to lower reduction in principal. It results in the higher loan balance over the life of the loan. Loans with lower interest rates Lower interest rates results in the higher reduction of principal after the monthly payments and it goes towards the reduction of the principal balance. It can result in a lower total loan balance over time. In October 2023, Bankrate study published a report where it stated that the average personal interest in the United States is 11.43%. It is important to note that there are multiple factors that can impact the credit score, including income, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, loan term and others. Credit Score Average Interest Rates 720-850 10.73% \u2013 12.5% 690-719 13.5% \u2013 15.5% 630-689 17.80%- 19.90% 300-629 28.50%-32.00% Source: Bankrate Term of the Loan The duration of the loan can significantly affect the total balance. Short term loans generally come with lower interest costs and higher monthly payments. Long term loans can offer lower monthly payments but can lead to higher high overall interest expenses. Delayed or Missed Payments The failure to make timely payment can result in late fees and penalties. Furthermore, it can increase interest costs, as interest is calculated on the outstanding balance. Loan Refinancing Loan refinancing can reduce the monthly payments as it may increase the total loan balance over the life of the loan. It is important to understand when and how the refinance is beneficial and essential. If a user does not have a strong understanding of finance and the working of a loan, they should consult a financial advisor. Additional Financing It takes out more loans while they still manage their existing debt, which can lead to a snowball effect, increasing their overall financial burden. It is a risky idea to take out a new loan to pay off the existing one. Inflation And Other Economic Factors External economic factors, such as inflation, can affect the real value of a loan. It is important to consider these factors while managing the total loan balance over the years. Impact on loans at fixed interest If a borrower has a loan at a fixed interest rate, their monthly payment remains constant throughout the loan tenure. It provides stability \u2013 as inflation increases, it decreases the real cost of the loan. Stated differently, the fixed payments that a user makes have decrease future purchasing power. Impact on variable interest loans In contrast, variable interest rate loans can also get impacted by inflation. These loans have an interest rate that is tied to a benchmark rate, such as the prime rate. With the increase in inflation, the central bank may increase the benchmark rates to cover it. When there is an increase in benchmark rates, the interest amount on variable rate loan increases, making the loan more expensive. Conclusion: Steps To Manage & Reduce Total Loan Balances There are multiple strategies which can help keep total loan balances under control and prevent any unplanned increases. The strategies include early repayment, debt consolidation, financial planning and budgeting, seeking professional financial advice, and loan forgiveness programs. It is important for a borrower to understand the factors that increase total loan balances for successful financial management. It is important to take a balanced approach and make informed decisions about the rate of interest, loan tenure and repayment strategies. FAQs What are the disadvantages of paying loans early? There can be prepayment penalties in some of the countries and it can also reduce tax benefits. These funds can also be used for other purposes. What are the advantages of making early loan payments? The interest payments can be reduced, which can help in managing debt. What can lead to an increase in total loan balances? It has factors such as interest rates, small payments and delayed payments.","article_summary":"It is important to understand the dynamics of the total loan balance, which is responsible for financial management.

Crypto Industry Concerns With Gensler\u2019s \u201cRegulation by Enforcement\u201d Approach The perception of Gensler\u2019s \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d strategy has long been a source of concern for the cryptocurrency business. Under his direction, the number of SEC enforcement proceedings about cryptocurrency increased to 46 in 2023, double that of 2021, and hit a 10-year high. Executives in the US cryptocurrency sector and a few legislators have charged that Gensler is adopting an oppressive stance. They cite the SEC\u2019s contention that hundreds of cryptocurrencies are securities in cases brought against cryptocurrency companies. However, Gensler has defended his actions, saying there is a lot of fraud and manipulation in the cryptocurrency field and that businesses should \u201ccome into compliance.\u201d Uncertain Future For Gensler\u2019s Tenure The SEC and the cryptocurrency community are at odds over Gensler\u2019s latest post, which may have been intended as a joke. Led by Gensler, the SEC has long been concerned about investor compliance and safety with cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency society monitors Gensler closely to see if his views on the industry shift during his remaining days as SEC chair. Many people wonder whether Gensler will adhere to stringent rules or cooperate with the cryptocurrency sector to find a middle ground.

BlastUP Goes Viral, Raising $4.6 Million in a Few Weeks BlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made waves in the crypto world with its stunning debut, raising $4.6 million in just a few weeks. Many smart investors are rushing to buy BlastUP tokens before their value skyrockets. Holders of BlastUP tokens may benefit from a number of privileges, including participation in an Airdrop, exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest through staking. BlastUP stands out from the crowd in the crypto world. Backed by Blast, the sixth largest blockchain by TVL, it offers genuine utility as a launchpad for DApp ventures. With its motto Grow faster, earn more, BlastUP is dedicated to propelling the success of blockchain startups. Those who join BlastUP now become part of a project poised to become the next big thing. >> Buy BlastUP tokens before they skyrocket << Ethereum Price Overview and Cautiously Optimistic Predictions The price of Ethereum has seen a diverse set of changes recently. Within the last week, the price fell by 12.37%, and the past month saw a decrease of 15.70%. However, looking back six months, the coin has actually increased in value by 95.97%. Currently, Ethereum trades between $2771.40 and $3637.80. Its price movement appears to show a mix of both impulsive and corrective patterns, responding to various market influences. Considering the current trends, Ethereum could go either way. It\u2019s handling a level between major support at $2383.95 and resistance at $4116.75. The long-term perspective is bright, supported by a 95.97% increase in the past six months. However, the short-term outlook is more uncertain, given the recent declines. Market indicators like the RSI and MACD suggest neither strong bullish nor bearish momentum, leaving room for shifts in either direction. Investors should eye the $4116.75 and $4983.15 resistance levels for positive breaks or the $2383.95 and $1517.55 support levels for potential downturns. Solana Current Price Movement Demands Cautious Approach Ahead Solana\u2019s price has seen significant changes. In the past week, Solana\u2019s price dropped by nearly 20%. Over the past month, the decline is sharper at over 31%. However, when looking at the past six months, SOL\u2019s value soared by roughly 453%. It\u2019s now trading between $118.70 and $184.63. Price movements seem more corrective lately, as current trends show a pullback from earlier gains. Solana\u2019s current market position offers mixed signals. The nearest resistance level is at $217.68, suggesting room for growth if momentum increases. However, support at $85.82 must hold to prevent larger drops. Some analysts expect potential upsides, eyeing the second resistance at $283.61. Yet, investors must stay cautious. A fall below the second support level of $19.89 could indicate a deeper trend reversal. Pyth Network (PYTH) Price Snapshot and Future Moves In the past week, PYTH\u2019s value dropped by 24.23%, indicating a downtrend. Over the past month, PYTH decreased by 46.13%, continuing the negative momentum. However, looking back six months, the coin shows a 55.10% increase. PYTH currently fluctuates between $0.44 and $0.82, hinting at uncertainty. The price action lately seems corrective with attempts to stabilize around this range. PYTH\u2019s price could head for the $1.03 resistance if it gains more support. The second resistance at $1.41 might be a target if the momentum continues. However, if the price falls, the $0.27 support level might be tested. With the RSI at 56.06 and Stochastic at 74.50, PYTH appears relatively stable. However, the lack of a strong MACD signal suggests investors might await clearer trends before taking action. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s recent pattern suggests that now might be a good time to look at altcoins for investment opportunities. Among them, ETH, SOL, and PYTH might not offer significant returns in the short term. However, BlastUP stands out with its solid concept and its integration with the Blast ecosystem. That indicates it could have the highest potential moving forward. As the bull run for 2024 gains momentum, BlastUP proves to be an attractive option for those looking to invest in the crypto market.

This achievement, announced on April 16, brings the project one step closer to its goal of 15 million KYC\u2019d users, a requirement for the launch of the project\u2019s mainnet and the traceability of its tokens. Despite this milestone, concerns remain about the value Pi Network can bring its users, as the Pi tokens cannot currently be exchanged for fiat currency on cryptocurrency exchanges. A Unique KYC Approach But An Unclear Path To Utility The Pi team has touted its proprietary KYC solution as a \u201cunique and proprietary approach that combines machine automation and crowdsourced, hyperlocal human verification to accomplish secure, accurate, and efficient KYC.\u201d The team claims that other Web3 services could leverage this approach for identity verification. However, the need for token tradability remains a significant obstacle. According to the business analytics platform AIMultiple, Pi Network \u201ccan not yet exchange their Pi coins with fiat currency on exchanges,\u201d suggesting that the project may not bring \u201cany value to users\u201d at this stage. Conditions For Mainnet Launch & The Concerns Raised The Pi Network team has announced plans to launch an \u201cOpen Network\u201d or mainnet in 2024, provided certain conditions are met. These include developing 100 Pi apps, completing 15 million KYC verifications, and fulfilling various technological, product, business, and legal requirements. AIMultiple analyst Cem Dilmegani expressed skepticism about the project\u2019s potential benefits, stating that Pi Network \u201cworks like a direct selling or affiliate marketing system, promising future rewards to users for bringing in new users.\u201d Dilmegani suggested that the app\u2019s primary purpose is to drive traffic and sell advertising, with the founders being the primary beneficiaries. The analyst also raised concerns about the potential for the token\u2019s value to plummet if a mainnet is launched, as users may rapidly sell their holdings, reducing the token\u2019s value and eliminating the incentive for users to continue logging in and clicking. Pi Network\u2019s Response & Unconventional Approach In response to Cointelegraph\u2019s inquiries, a Pi Network representative acknowledged the project\u2019s \u201cunconventional and novel\u201d approach to blockchain development. The representative argued that the \u201cEnclosed Network period of mainnet\u201d was intentionally chosen to enable utility building and KYC processing before launching the open network. The representative claimed that Pi had accomplished several goals, including creating a mining app, browser, node application, testnet, mainnet, wallet, and developer platform. The representative stated that the delay in launching the open network was to ensure a \u201chealthy launch of the Open Network\u201d and that \u201canything worthwhile takes time and patience\u201d. The Future Remains Uncertain While Pi Network has achieved the significant milestone of 10 million KYC\u2019d users, the project\u2019s lack of token tradability and analysts\u2019 concerns about its potential value proposition raise questions about its long-term viability and adoption.

The executive, Tigran Gambaryan, along with another Binance official, is facing accusations of laundering over $35 million. The case, which has been adjourned until May 2, is being handled by Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption body. Binance CEO Says They Are Working to Resolve Matter During the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai, Binance CEO Richard Teng addressed Gambaryan\u2019s situation, claiming that they are working to deal with the issue. \u201cWhat I can say is we are working very closely with the Nigerian authorities to try to resolve the matter.\u201d Meanwhile, the other executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan serving as a regional manager for Africa, fled Nigeria last month. Anjarwalla and Gambaryan had traveled to Nigeria after the country implemented a ban on several cryptocurrency trading websites. However, upon their arrival on February 26, they were detained by Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In addition to the EFCC case, Nigeria\u2019s tax agency, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), has charged Binance and the executives with tax evasion. The tax evasion case is set to appear before a court on Friday. Binance\u2019s head of regional markets, Vishal Sacheendran, emphasized that the detentions were an isolated incident and unprecedented for the company. However, he declined to comment on the charges against Binance itself. The charges against Binance Holdings Limited and its chief executives include tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering amounting to $35.4 million. Court documents reveal that charges were filed against Binance Holdings Limited, Tigran Gambaryan, and Nadeem Anjarwalla (now at large) on March 28, 2024, before the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja. The charges include engaging in specialized financial business without a valid license, conducting business as a financial institution without authorization, unlawful negotiation of foreign exchange rates, conspiracy to conceal the origin of illicit funds, and money laundering. Additionally, on March 22, the Nigerian government filed another four-count charge against Binance Holdings Limited, Anjarwalla, and Gambaryan, accusing them of offering services to subscribers on their platform without registering with the Federal Inland Revenue Service and failing to pay relevant taxes. Binance Receives Dubai License Binance recently announced that it has obtained a license from Dubai\u2019s regulator, VARA, enabling the platform to cater to retail clients along with qualified and institutional ones. According to Bloomberg, the licensing process involved Binance\u2019s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, relinquishing voting control of the Dubai unit. However, Teng dismissed the report as speculation, emphasizing that the company does not comment on media speculation and maintains confidential relationships with regulators. The European Union\u2019s securities watchdog recently highlighted that \u201ccrypto exchanges largely operate outside of national legal frameworks\u201d and mentioned that Binance claims not to have a headquarters. When asked about Binance\u2019s choice of global headquarters, Teng revealed that the company has shortlisted potential locations but refrained from commenting on specific places or providing a timeline for a definitive decision.

CHP Price Analysis: Will Spring CSOP Supercharge CHP Token Price? At the time of writing CHP token was currently trading at a market price of $0.059 (representing a 24 hour change of +0.10%). A glance at the CHP price chart reveals the seismic impact of the upcoming CSOP Spring \u2013 which has breathed life into struggling price action \u2013 triggering an upside move. This shifts CHP sentiment bullish, with price action now consolidating recent gains atop a higher support level above $0.0575. Increased buy pressure (91% of transactions in the past 24 hours) due to the event announcement could fuel further upside moves \u2013 especially amid a reflected growth in volume. And indeed, with a market cap standing at $16.24m \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that CHP could unlock as much as 5x gains over the coming months ahead.

In a CNBC interview published Thursday, Scaramucci discussed Bitcoin\u2019s nascent stage of adoption. He said the asset will not achieve its marketed role as an inflation hedge or a store of value until its user base surpasses 1 billion. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s going to be way more volatile than people like,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people look at it as a risk-on or risk-off trade until we get to that adoption.\u201d His comments came before Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Friday amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. The drop followed reports of an Israeli missile strike on Iran. Bitcoin Falls in Wake of Reported Missile Strike According to ABC News, Israel launched missiles in a retaliatory strike against Iran early Friday. Iran\u2019s Fars news agency reported hearing three explosions near a military base in Isfahan, a central city. An Iranian official reportedly refuted claims of a missile attack, attributing the explosions to the activation of Iran\u2019s air defense systems. During geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, investors tend to become more cautious and seek safer assets to protect their investments. Traditionally, they turn to assets like gold and government bonds for safety. Scaramucci went on to express optimism regarding Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects. He anticipates factors like the recent Spot ETF launch, the entry of major financial institutions, and the upcoming halving event to potentially propel Bitcoin\u2019s value toward $200,000. Additionally, he dismissed concerns about excessive centralization due to ETFs. Scaramucci argues that current institutional ownership, including BlackRock, represents a relatively small portion of the overall Bitcoin market, less than 10%. Scaramucci Ups Bitcoin Price Prediction Scaramucci\u2019s most recent price prediction for Bitcoin exceeds his prior forecast. Earlier this year, he projected that Bitcoin could surge to $170,000 by mid-to-late 2025, assuming it maintained a price of above $45,000 at the time of the halving. The Bitcoin network undergoes a technical event known as a halving, which serves to decrease the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Scheduled to occur between April 19 and 20, this event reduces the miner reward for verifying transactions by 50%. This halving mechanism will continue until the total number of Bitcoins in circulation reaches its capped supply of 21m.

According to a report by Michael Nadeau, an analyst at The DeFi Report, Ethereum\u2019s Q1 income represents a staggering 200% increase compared to the $123 million profit recorded in Q4 2023. A major contributing factor to this substantial growth was the surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity during the quarter, driving heightened network participation. Ethereum Fee Revenue Reaches $1.17B in Q1 Ethereum\u2019s fee revenue, generated through user transactions, reached a notable milestone of $1.17 billion in Q1, marking a remarkable 155% increase from the same period in 2023 and an 80% upswing from the previous quarter. The amplified network activity, fueled by the surge in DeFi applications, has propelled Ethereum\u2019s average daily transactions in 2024 to surpass last year\u2019s figures. The current average of 1.15 million daily transactions is in close proximity to the peak levels witnessed during Ethereum\u2019s momentous run in 2021. It is worth noting that Ethereum, which was launched in 2015, achieved its first profitable year in 2023, amassing $623 million in revenue. Despite the revenues being significantly lower (75%) than the peak of $9.9 billion attained in 2021, this achievement can be attributed to the transition to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022, resulting in a substantial drop in token incentives paid to miners, now known as validators. Cryptocurrencies to Outperform Other Assets Nadeau said that \u201ccrypto will outperform everything else\u201d in the coming years. He anticipates favorable liquidity conditions for the next few years, driven by the need for refinancing a substantial amount of debt in the United States and the market\u2019s expectation of three rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. These factors are poised to provide a tailwind for risk assets like tech stocks and quality cryptocurrencies. Nadeau identified three additional catalysts that indicate a bullish setup for the crypto market. Firstly, the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is expected to increase interest and accessibility to cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 20, has historically prompted a bull run in the subsequent year. Lastly, Nadeau highlighted the ongoing innovation cycle, which he believes will attract new venture funding and reignite retail interest in crypto as the industry matures. While Bitcoin typically outperforms in the early stages of a bull market due to its widespread recognition, Nadeau noted that Ethereum and altcoins tend to outperform Bitcoin in the later stages of the cycle. Altcoins, which have a clear product market fit, have demonstrated substantial growth in the previous cycles, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance across the entire duration. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network. As reported, data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, show that the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

This movement underpins ongoing volatility as traders and analysts closely monitor trends to update their Bitcoin price prediction. Despite this recent downturn, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market with a robust trading volume of $40.55 billion and a market capitalization nearing $1.19 trillion. Bitcoin Price Prediction The technical analysis for Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows it navigating through a challenging phase. The pivot point for today\u2019s session is at $62,216, a level that Bitcoin struggles to reclaim. Immediate resistance lies significantly higher at $64,606, with further barriers at $67,695 and $70,959 suggesting a steep climb for any potential recovery. Conversely, support levels are established at $59,418, and if this fails, the next cushions are at $56,271 and $53,182. A key indicator of market sentiment, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is at 40, signaling that Bitcoin is potentially oversold but still under considerable selling pressure as it remains below the midline of 50. This suggests that the current bearish trend may persist unless there is a significant shift in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Prediction The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $65,415, further reinforcing the resistance around the $62,200 level. This configuration of the EMA confirms the resistance created by the downward channel, adding a technical obstacle to Bitcoin\u2019s upward mobility. In conclusion, the outlook for Bitcoin is currently bearish below the key pivot of $62,216. Should Bitcoin manage to break above this threshold, it could indicate a shift to a more bullish sentiment. However, as long as the price remains below this level, the path of least resistance appears to be downward, with potential targets located at lower support levels.

Per Kommersant, the officials were named Georgy Satyukov and Dmitry Sokolov, employees at \u201cone of the ministry\u2019s most secret divisions.\u201d The media outlet and major Russian Telegram news channels claimed the duo worked at the Bureau of Special Technical Events. The bureau is allegedly codenamed \u201cDepartment K.\u201d Reports claim the duo received their bribes in crypto over a period from March 19 to October 2021. Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Rocked by Crypto Bribe Allegations Telegram news channels claimed Department K is a secret cyber crime investigation unit. The unit appears to have been investigating the BTC-e crypto exchange. A computer expert named Alexander Vinnik founded BTC-e. Vinnik worked at the firm from 2011 to 2017. He was arrested in Greece in 2017 on fraud and money laundering charges. Media outlets explained that a Singapore-based firm named Wex took over BTC-e business operations. However, questions remained over what should happen regarding BTC-e customer funds. Law enforcers allegedly believe a Wex executive named Alexey Ivanov offered Satyukov and Sokolov Bitcoin and Ethereum coins to \u201cprotect\u201d him from a police probe. Officers reportedly believe Ivanov sent Satyukov and Sokolov a combined total of BTC 2,200 and \u201cmore than ETH 10,000 thousand.\u201d The media outlets said the money \u201cwas transferred through Sokolov to cryptocurrency wallets held by Satyukov.\u201d German authorities arrest two men suspected of espionage for Russia and membership of a terror group planning acts of sabotage against military and industrial sites https://t.co/nKRj62Obb6 \u2014 Bloomberg (@business) April 18, 2024 Officials \u2018Fled Country Fearing Prosecution\u2019 Kommersant said the duo had been arrested \u201cin absentia\u201d after fleeing the country. An unnamed source said they were residing in Dubai, with one living in an apartment in the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world\u2019s tallest building. The media outlet said that investigators had \u201clearned about the alleged corruption in the department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\u201d from Ivanov. The latter was accused of embezzling money from a crypto exchange in 2023. Kommersant said Ivanov had agreed to provide information in a \u201cpre-trial agreement\u201d with the First Deputy Prosecutor-General Anatoly Razinkin. The Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Lodo27 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Satyukov, the media outlet continued, is a former \u201chead of a department that combats IT-related crimes in the credit and financial sector.\u201d The newspaper wrote that, if the duo were guilty, this would be a new record for a bribery case in Russia. The previous \u201cholder\u201d of this \u201crecord\u201d was another interior ministry official, Colonel Dmitry Zakharchenko. The latter was jailed for 13 years in 2019 after taking a bribe worth almost $15 million. \u2018People Think Crypto Transactions Aren\u2019t Traceable. They\u2019re Wrong\u2019 Media commentators said there was \u201ca misconception that bribes or any fraudulent actions that make use of cryptocurrency cannot be tracked\u201d in Russia. As such, many corrupt officials \u201cactively use\u201d crypto. BFM quoted the Co-chairman of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Alexander Treshchev as stating: \u201cThere is great uncertainty about the legal status of cryptocurrency in Russia, even though there are at least 1.5 to 2 million crypto traders in this country. Few of them know anything about whether [crypto trading] is legal. They don\u2019t know what can be done, and what cannot be done.\u201d Russian Government Crypto Chief: Mining Regulation Is Our Priority The Russian government\u2019s crypto working group chairman believes Bitcoin (BTC) mining regulation is now a priority for Moscow.#CryptoNews #newshttps://t.co/Gqdg4vwnZB \u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 9, 2024 Treshchev added: \u201cAs we can clearly see, law enforcement officers have begun to understand what crypto wallets are and how to transfer [coins]. But they are still just as naive as everyone else in that they do not understand that every single transaction is traceable [on blockchain networks].\u201d Russia\u2019s lack of crypto regulation has become a thorn in Moscow\u2019s side. Earlier this year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) downgraded Russia\u2019s compliance rating due to its \u201cinsufficient regulation of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.\u201d Politicians and central bankers have claimed they are close to issuing a draft crypto regulation bill, with industrial miners urging a faster rollout for legislation. Earlier this week, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine announced that a serving lawmaker will stand trial after allegedly trying to bribe a public official with Bitcoin.

Down more than 20% on the month and trading just above $0.50, XRP\u2019s market cap was last around $27.67 billion. That\u2019s nearly $4.5 billion less than USDC\u2019s market cap of just over $33 billion. XRP\u2019s coin ranking it now number 7, with USDC taking the 6th spot. The XRP price dumped hard earlier in the month amid a sharp altcoin sell-off. Geopolitics was the catalyst for the sell-off at the time, but macro headwinds have blocked a full recovery. And XRP\u2019s fortunes could yet worsen, with the cryptocurrency having broken below a key long-term uptrend. XRP Price Prediction \u2013 Here\u2019s Where XRP Is Headed Next XRP\u2019s sharp drop earlier this month saw the cryptocurrency break below an uptrend that had been in play going all the way back to early 2023. Since the break of this trendline, the XRP bears have already hit three major price targets. Those were at $0.4850, $0.46 and $0.43, with bears likely to eye $0.40 next. That target could well get hit is Bitcoin succumbs to a post-halving sell-the-fact reaction, and macro headwinds keep building. The XRP price\u2019s near-term technical outlook is ugly. Source: TradingView XRP Alternative to Consider \u2013 5thScape (5SCAPE) XRP\u2019s near-term technical outlook is ugly. The token may well continue to keep pace with its better-performing rivals for the remainder of 2024. After all, Bitcoin sits at the forefront of global adoption in wake of recent US spot ETF approvals. ETH, while still facing regulatory risk, is a much more dynamic chain and remains the major home of DeFi. Investors looking to take their first steps into the crypto market would likely do better choosing either of these two. Alternatively, for more risk-tolerant investors looking to secure higher gains, a good strategy to consider is presale investing. Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fundraising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token. These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors. Of course, presale investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket. But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains. One project that analysts at Cryptonews think has a good chance of delivering short-term gains is AR/VR innovator 5thScape (5SCAPE). 5thScape (5SCAPE) \u2013 2024\u2019s Most Promising Presale? First-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR/AR project 5thScape (5SCAPE) has already raised over $5 million so far. 5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision. Priced at just $0.00327, a steep discount versus the token\u2019s planned launch price of $0.1, investors who get involved now can lock in paper gains of 200%. Given its total token supply of 5.1 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $16 million. 5th Scape Presale Stage 5 is Now Live!

There is a good chance that it could one day become a $500 million market cap token. That means investors who get in now could potentially bag huge gains. 5thScape runs on the Ethereum network and will make use of the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities. $5SPACE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or card. Eighty percent of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale.

Surpassing previous highs, this data indicates a notable shift towards long-term holding strategies among investors. Defined by specific criteria, including balances exceeding 10 BTC, no outgoing transactions, and exclusion of exchange or miner-associated accounts, these BTC accumulation addresses suggest a strategic pivot towards long-term holding despite market fluctuations. The surge in accumulation signals enduring confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential, positioning it for a re-accumulation phase in the coming months after halving. BTC Accumulation and Post-Halving Predictions Notably, crypto analyst \u2018Rekt Capital\u2019 proposes that Bitcoin\u2019s current correction phase may soon give way to a re-accumulation period post-halving. Historical patterns suggest that a BTC accumulation phase often leads to a period of price consolidation following halving events. #BTC 3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving 1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace Bitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a month In mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% again This\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2BKBQXpPOV \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 17, 2024 Bitcoin\u2019s price typically remains range-bound for approximately five months post-halving, similar to what we observed in previous cycles. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could trade within the high $50k range until around October, reflecting a consolidation phase before potential upward momentum. Bitcoin Price Analysis and Resistance Levels Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading slightly below $64,000, marking a marginal increase of 4.3% within the past 24 hours. Jason Pizzino, a renowned crypto analyst, has offered insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price movements as well, identifying key resistance levels at $67,000, $69,000, and $71,000. He emphasizes the importance of a BTC accumulation and consolidation above $67,000 for sustained bullish momentum. However, Pizzino also warns of potential downside risks if Bitcoin fails to maintain support above the $59,000 to $60,000 range, potentially leading to a correction towards the low to mid $50,000 range or even lower. Pizzino uses historical data to contextualize current market dynamics, drawing parallels to past halving events and aiding investor decision-making. His analysis echoes Rekt Capital\u2019s observations regarding the potential BTC accumulation and price fluctuations following halvings. Recent data also indicates substantial capital outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, notably Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), contributing to the cryptocurrency\u2019s decline. Bitcoin miners\u2019 continuous selling before and after the halving event exerts additional downward pressure on the market.

Bitcoin Moonshot Prediction is Fueled by the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Plan B shared their forecast on X, emphasizing the positive influence of Halvings on BTC\u2019s price. They believe the upcoming Halving will be no different. IMO this bitcoin halving will NOT be different: \u2013 All bitcoin price increase will again be around the halving \u2013 Buying 6m before the halving and selling 18m after the halving (green line) will outperform buy&hold \u2013 BTC > $100k in 2024 \u2013 BTC top > $300k in 2025 pic.twitter.com/lCZjnuoYMO \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) April 17, 2024 Bitcoin halvings occurs every four years, reducing the rate at which new coins are created by half. Plan B\u2019s prediction is based on the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which evaluates Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity by comparing the circulating supply (stock) to the new supply entering the market (flow). According to the S2F model, as the supply of new Bitcoins decreases due to halving events, the scarcity of Bitcoin increases, potentially leading to higher prices. The Bitcoin price is expected to benefit from the increasing scarcity after the halving event and the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, such as via spot Bitcoin ETFs and because of Bitcoin Ordinals. In addition, Plan B shared insight regarding the timing of buying and selling Bitcoin around the halving event. The idea is rooted in the concept that Bitcoin\u2019s price typically rises leading up to and following a halving event due to the reduction in supply. BTC traders tend to capitalize on the anticipated price increase by purchasing Bitcoin just before the halving, while the prediction to sell shortly after the halving, within a timeframe of around \u201c18 minutes,\u201d is based on the notion that the BTC price surges immediately after the halving event. Plan B further explained that this strategy outperforms the conventional \u201cbuy and hold\u201d trade concept, which involves holding onto Bitcoin for a long period regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Agree, bitcoin must take out gold because it will have 2x scarcity/S2F. My \"BTC top > $300k\" is the low end of the $250k-$1m range. Last cycle I took the high end and BTC decided to go low end, let's see how this will work out. \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) April 17, 2024 Plan B also expressed sentiment that Bitcoin will perform better than gold, stating that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity will be twice that of gold after the halving, and the initial $300K price projection is conservative within its estimated range of $250,000 to $1 million. Plan B Bitcoin Price Prediction Aligns With Industry Analysts Plan B\u2019s Bitcoin forecast aligns with other experts in the field. Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, Standard Chartered Bank, and New York best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki are all optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory post-halving. During the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22, Cathie Wood forecasted that BTC\u2019s price could soar to $2.3 million per coin. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Bank raised its year-end forecast to $150,000, projecting a peak of $250,000 in 2025 before it settles around $200,000. Recall that Kiyosaki predicted the Bitcoin price to rise to $100K by June 2024. BITCOIN on fire. The biggest mistake you can make is to procrastinate. Important to start, even if only for $500.

Since then, BlackRock ETF Bitcoin holdings have grown by over 10,200%, amassing 272,550 BTC valued at $16.8 billion. The fund needs about $2.2 billion to close in on Grayscale\u2019s holdings.

Before the conversion, Grayscale held about 620,000 BTC, but its holdings have dropped by over 45% since then. Grayscale\u2019s holdings stand at 308,105 BTC as of writing. IBIT\u2019s impressive attainment has sparked M&A discussions, with some analysts suggesting that an IBIT takeover could be around the corner. While both ETFs have had a slowdown in accumulation and selling patterns in recent weeks, IBIT\u2019s $866 million net inflows on March 13 and GBTC\u2019s $607 million outflows on March 19 (its fourth-largest since inception) suggest that the broader market sentiment might be shifting in favor of BlackRock. Source: Dune Additionally, GBTC\u2019s high trading fee of 1.5% \u2013 the highest among all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers could impact patronage. In contrast, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT charges a modest 0.25% fee, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s ETF offers an even lower fee of 0.19%. Despite IBIT\u2019s notable growth, the spot Bitcoin ETFs market has experienced dwindling net inflows recently. Volatility Amid the Battle for Spot Bitcoin ETF Dominance According to data from Farside Investors, IBIT recorded net inflows of $73.4 million on April 15, lower than the previous day\u2019s inflow of $111.1 million. However, aside from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, the other eight ETFs reported no inflows during that period, which contributed to BlackRock\u2019s growing market share in the Bitcoin ETF segment. The ten-spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $91.8 million between April 12 and April 15. These outflows coincided with a volatile week for Bitcoin, which saw a 9.54% price drop to about $63,000 as of writing. Globally, Bitcoin investment products experienced $110 million in outflow between April 12 and 17, indicating investor \u201chesitancy,\u201d according to CoinShares\u2019 James Butterfill.

These groups essentially aim to help members navigate the crypto landscape \u2013 and enable them to make more informed trading decisions. So, without further ado, let\u2019s take a closer look at the top Patreon communities for digital asset investors and what crypto tips they offer members: 1. TodayTrader \u2013 Overall Best Crypto Patreon Group For those seeking to master crypto trading strategies, look no further than the TodayTrader Patreon group. Helmed by Mark Kelly, a stock trader turned crypto investor, this community offers all members a comprehensive suite of benefits.

Through interactive features like patron-only voting and live trading rooms, members can engage with their peers, exchange ideas, and learn from a collective pool of expertise. Multiple pricing tiers exist, from the $1/month \u201cCrypto Enthusiast\u201d level for those seeking basic access to the all-encompassing $97/month \u201cCrypto Partner\u201d tier. This latter tier unlocks exclusive benefits, including personal setup calls, weekly mastermind sessions, and much more.

TodayTrader has also recently released a crypto course explaining how snipe early entries in new crypto launches. Join the TodayTrader Patreon group 2. Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan \u2013 Popular Crypto Patreon Group for Real-Time Trading Signals Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan is another of the top crypto Patreon groups to consider. Led by Jacob Bury, who happens to have one of the best crypto YouTube channels with over 37,000 subscribers, this group offers trading insights, educational resources, and a network of investors all looking to improve their skills. This group promises regular trading signals for both spot and leverage trading. These signals are crafted by Jacob and allow members to take advantage of market opportunities as soon as they arise. With up to 500 signals per month (for the Crypto Legend tier), members get a steady flow of potential opportunities. Beyond signals, Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan is a group that supports traders of all levels. Newcomers can benefit from the educational resources, including video tutorials, live classrooms, and an e-book created by Jacob himself. Higher membership tiers unlock additional benefits for those seeking exclusivity and early access. From presale whitelisting to insider info on ultra-low-cap projects, members can get in on the ground floor of promising ventures before the masses do. However, what truly sets Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan apart is the sense of community it offers. This Patreon has one of the best crypto Discord groups on our list, where members can engage in lively discussions and build connections with fellow crypto enthusiasts. Finally, Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan caters to diverse needs and budgets with multiple price tiers ranging from $10.50 to $103.50 per month. For that reason, it\u2019s undoubtedly one of the best crypto Patreon groups to subscribe to this year. Join Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan Patreon Group 3. Crypto Gains \u2013 Huge Crypto Patreon Group with Tiers for Every Budget The Crypto Gains Patreon group is another option for new and experienced investors. Led by a charismatic and passionate YouTuber, this group offers real-time alerts, in-depth analysis, and a network of retail investors. Like the two groups discussed above, Crypto Gains offers buy, sell, and take-profit alerts. These alerts provide a glimpse into the creator\u2019s trading activities, allowing members to stay ahead of the curve. But Crypto Gains goes further than trading signals. The community offers educational resources like crypto guides, tutorials, and spreadsheets. From understanding technical analysis to mastering trading strategies, these resources help traders of all experience levels navigate the crypto market effectively. However, what truly sets Crypto Gains apart is the sense of exclusivity it provides. Through the \u201cVIP Lounge\u201d and \u201cStealth Buy Alerts\u201d sections, higher-tier members gain early access to content before it reaches the broader public. This exclusivity offers a potential advantage in a market where timing is everything. Crypto Gains\u2019 pricing tiers range from $1.50/month to $551.50/month, ensuring an option for every budget alongside his free crypto YouTube videos. So, whether it\u2019s the best crypto projects to hold long-term or hidden gems ahead of the next bull cycle, Crypto Gains\u2019 Patreon aims to give its members a leg up in the market.

Led by a top crypto influencer dedicated to simplifying advanced topics, this Patreon community offers a library of short, simple, and easy-to-understand tutorials covering a range of crypto-related topics.

With a focus on accessibility, this community can be joined for just $5 per month \u2013 and for free for those happy to view ads. Although Krypto Cove posts less regularly than the three Patreon groups mentioned above, it is still an excellent resource for those seeking to unlock the potential of the DeFi space. For that reason, Krypto Cove is suitable for all investors, regardless of their experience level. 5. Crypto Seth \u2013 Well-Known YouTuber Offering Crypto Patreon Group Crypto Seth\u2019s Patreon community is all about gaining an edge in the crypto market. This isn\u2019t just another place to get generic content \u2013 it\u2019s an inner circle where members receive real-time alerts on buying, selling, accumulating, and staking opportunities directly from Seth himself. For those unaware, Crypto Seth is a YouTube personality with over 23,000 followers. He posts regular breakdowns on the best altcoins and micro-cap tokens, with many of his videos receiving 20,000+ views. However, Crypto Seth\u2019s Patreon group takes things one step further than his YouTube channel. The group offers private webinars, portfolio breakdowns, cheat sheets, and even Q&A sessions where investors can get personal guidance. With a diverse toolkit of resources and a sense of exclusivity, Crypto Seth\u2019s Patreon is ideal for crypto enthusiasts who want to take their game to a new level. 6. Bitcoin Ben \u2013 Best Free Crypto Patreon Group Rounding off our list of the top Patreon crypto groups is Bitcoin Ben \u2013 a down-to-earth trucker who\u2019s made it his mission to bring cryptocurrencies to the mainstream. His Patreon community is the ideal destination for those looking to level up their crypto game, especially during and after the Bitcoin halving event. What makes Ben\u2019s Patreon special is that it offers a free tier packed with valuable content and resources. But for crypto diehards, the paid tiers unlock an entire universe of perks \u2013 from real-time alerts and analysis to private webinars and Q&As with Ben himself. As Bitcoin continues its volatile path, having a trusted guide like Bitcoin Ben could make all the difference. His passion for simplifying crypto is contagious, and with a laidback and approachable personality, engaging with his content is an enjoyable experience for all. How to Find the Best Crypto Patreon Groups Finding the best crypto Patreon group to join can be a challenging task, since there are hundreds of options to choose from. Here are some strategies to help identify groups that align with your goals and preferences: Leverage the Crypto Network The crypto community is tight-knit, and word-of-mouth can be a powerful tool. Reach out to fellow enthusiasts, traders, or investors on social media and ask for recommendations. A good resource would be the best crypto Twitter accounts, which tend to have a grasp on popular educational resources in the space. Scour Reddit & Discord Following on from the recommendations on Twitter, dive into crypto-focused Reddit threads and Discord servers to find mentions of top-rated Patreon groups. Communities on these platforms tend to openly discuss (and criticize) influential traders and analysts. Look for recurring mentions of specific creators \u2013 this is usually a good sign. Evaluate the Creator\u2019s Reputation Before committing to a Patreon group, research the creator or team behind it. Look for factors such as: Industry experience and expertise Consistent track record of delivering value Transparency and commitment to ethical practices Engagement with the community Responsiveness to feedback Reputable creators often have a strong online presence, whether on Twitter or Instagram, making it easier to assess their value. Consider Your Specific Needs & Goals Unsurprisingly, different Patreon groups cater to various needs and investment styles. Some may focus on technical analysis, while others prioritize uncovering the best meme coins to buy. This is why it\u2019s crucial to identify your goals ahead of time. Are you a seasoned trader seeking an edge, a newcomer looking to learn the basics, or an investor interested solely in low-cap tokens? Here are some factors to consider: Type of content and resources offered (analysis, signals, tutorials, etc.) Level of access and exclusivity (tiers, early releases, private Discord servers) Community engagement and networking opportunities Pricing and value proposition By considering these factors, you\u2019ll be better equipped to sift through the best crypto Patreon groups and find ones that truly resonate with your needs. Why Join Cryptocurrency Patreon Groups? As highlighted in this guide, joining a Patreon crypto group can provide access to top crypto trading strategies, real-time signals, and a wealth of educational materials. But these are just some of the benefits. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at why you may wish to use a crypto Patreon teacher in 2024: Gain an Informational Edge Access to timely and accurate information can be the difference in the crypto market. Crypto Patreon groups offer a direct line to insiders, analysts, and experienced traders who can provide insights that may not be readily available elsewhere. Just like having a knowledgeable guide on a hike through unfamiliar terrain, these groups can help you navigate the crypto market with confidence. Stay Ahead of the Curve As most traders will know, the crypto market moves fast, with new projects and technologies emerging all the time. Patreon groups can act as an early \u201cwarning system,\u201d keeping you informed about the latest developments, risks, and opportunities before they hit the mainstream. For example, the rise of Real World Assets (RWAs) was likely discussed on Patreon long before gaining widespread attention. Considering RWAs have become one of the biggest crypto narratives of the year so far, this highlights the value of being part of a well-established Patreon group. Access Exclusive Opportunities Many top-tier Patreon groups offer their members exclusive access to the best crypto presales, airdrops, and other lucrative opportunities that may be unavailable to the general public. For example, members of the \u201cCrypto Champion\u201d tier on Jacob\u2019s Crypto Clan received early access to projects that soared over 1,900% from their presale price. This level of exclusivity can be thought of as having a backstage pass to a concert. You get to experience something truly unique and potentially valuable, while the masses do not. Community & Networking Beyond the informational benefits, crypto Patreon groups serve as communities where like-minded individuals can connect, share ideas, and learn from one another. This peer-to-peer interaction can be invaluable \u2013 especially for those new to the crypto world. Additionally, joining a Patreon group can open up opportunities for direct engagement with industry experts. A great example is the TodayTrader Patreon group, where members of the \u201cCrypto Partner\u201d tier receive weekly mastermind sessions with Mark Kelly. Best Crypto Patreon Groups \u2013 Conclusion To conclude, navigating the crypto market can be daunting, especially for beginners. That\u2019s why joining a reputable and well-established Patreon group is often a wise move. We recommend checking out the TodayTrader Patreon group, which offers many benefits for novice and experienced traders. From regular trading signals to direct engagement with industry experts, this community provides the tools necessary to succeed in crypto.

Like the rest of the market, BCH appears to be tracking market leader Bitcoin, which fell 9% over the last week to trade for around $63,650, at the time of writing. Growing turmoil in the Middle East after an Iranian attack on Israel last weekend prompted the sell-off, which has now slowed down. The two Bitcoins are now in the green again after the last 24 hours added 5% and 7% to BTC and BCH respectively. Investors are stocking up ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s quadrennial halving on Saturday. That\u2019s the day when a software update will halve BTC mining rewards. History suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of a bull run. The previous three halvings have all increased the price of the original cryptocurrency as the halved supply struggled to meet consistent demand. There are some fears, however, that this year the halving may have already been priced in. However, BCH\u2019s price chart for the last three months tells a very different story to its namesake. At the beginning of March, Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies began a rally that peaked by the middle. BCH initially rallied in step with them, but the momentum fell by March 3. On the other end of the chart, BCH rallied from late March to early April, independent of Bitcoin, which remained stagnant over the same period. How Bitcoin Cash Differs to Bitcoin Back in 2017, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which allow the network to process more transactions per second. However, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business. This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations. The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments. The original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value. Betting on Bitcoin? Why Not Gamble With Megadice? The uncertainty around Bitcoin\u2019s halving underscores the volatility of crypto in general. It is still very much a bet, although early projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are a safer bet than others. Still, the crypto world abounds with plenty of useful applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future. One such application is the world of GambleFi. A new ICO for Solana GameFi token Mega Dice (DICE) started this week and it has already raised over $300,000. DICE is the native token for Mega Dice\u2019s Telegram-based crypto casino, with certain games requiring the token to play. It can also be used for staking casino cashback, airdrop prizes, and special NFT benefits. Curious?

WIF Tumbles 31% as Capital Moves to New Solana Meme Coin","author":"Tim Hakki","article_detailed_content":"Popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) posted seven-day depreciation of as much as 50% in 24 hours by the morning of Thursday, April 18, according to data by CoinGecko, although its intraweek losses have since slowed to about 31% as of this writing. Among meme coins, WIF took some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide downturn that has shaved double digit percentages off virtually every leading cryptocurrency in the last week. Leading meme coins fell by comparable amounts this week: sector leader Dogecoin (DOGE) lost 25%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 19.5%, PEPE shed 28%, FLOKI crashed 30% and BONK is down hardest (35%) among the 10 largest funny tokens by market cap. Bitcoin (BTC) led the losses with a 12% drop over the week and trades at just under $62k. The original cryptocurrency was buffeted by a stormy news cycle that began last weekend when Iran attacked Israel in retaliation for a strike in Syria that killed Iranian soldiers. Additionally, volatility has increased a little ahead of Saturday\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, a software update that will halve BTC mining rewards. The halving effectively chokes the new supply of Bitcoin and has many analysts suggesting an imminent bull run as the supply struggles to keep up with fresh institutional demand from the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January. Substantial Bitcoin price drops typically signal a market-wide dip. Today virtually every leading cryptocurrency is posting double-digit losses over the week. Move Over DogWifHat, Solana\u2019s New Star is a Sloth Meme coins have an edge on every other crypto category on Saturday, because Bitcoin\u2019s halving coincidentally falls on April 20, international Doge Day. The Dogecoin community selected Doge Day to commemorate their favorite coin, but given the competition in crypto, many expect canine-related meme coins to get a look-in that day. April 20 is also the day stoners commemorate their favorite hobby, and a new novelty coin on Solana hopes to challenge canine dominance that day. Enter Slothana (SLOTH). From the clock on the wall to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is one of 4/20\u2019s biggest fans. And lo, Slothana, in its eternal wisdom and benevolence, hath decreed: 'Behold, there are but twelve days remaining until the dawn of a new era.' Let us prepare our hearts and minds, for the age of Slothana draws near. May the gains and Lambos be bestowed upon us all.\u2026 \u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 17, 2024 Slothana raised over $10 million in his ICO as traders flocked to the coin hoping to catch some of the early upside potential of other Solana meme legends that have pumped recently, like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk.

In the most recent surge, the Pepe Birthday token (PEPEBDAY) experienced a dramatic 200x increase in price. However, with the price now receding, attention is turning to whether another coin might be poised for a similar explosion. This article will provide an analysis of PEPEBDAY\u2019s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative multi-chain meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time. PEPE BIRTHDAY ENTERED SOL TRENDING AGAIN Today is a very important day for us, our party continues and we are waiting for you!

PEPEBDAY Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin Celebrates PEPE\u2019s First Birthday \u2013 How High Will Pump Go? As price action retreats, Pepe Birthday token is currently trading at a market price of $0.000032 (representing a 24-hour change of -90%). This comes after PEPEBDAY launched at just 9 AM UTC on April 17, in a listing that garnered immediate attention from eagle-eyed DEX traders. Quickfire traction saw PEPEBDAY accelerate +14,000% to hit an all-time high at $0.0076 just 5-hours later \u2013 yet, the sudden gains appear to have been short-lived, with early-bird investors moving quick for a sell-off that has since bled-out most of Yesterday\u2019s big gains. Pepe Birthday token is now left trading at last-stand support above $0.00003 \u2013 with 1,220 holders risking a complete capitulation. And despite the timely launch, and alluringly low $32k market cap \u2013 with buy pressure representing just 35% of transactions over the past hour \u2013 all might be over for this fresh-faced moonshot. For this reason, many astute traders are shifting their attention to a viral meme coin presale. Traders Flock to The Dogeverse: Multichain Crypto Presale Hammers Multi-Million Raise With Dogecoin in focus and bears pressing on, more investors are training their eyes on Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) \u2013 which offers early-bird advantage that could unlock huge gains. The multi-chain meme coin is rapidly gaining traction, raising over $7 million in its ongoing presale. Another fantastic milestone in the books! #DOGEVERSE hits over $7 million! #Cosmo sends a heartfelt thanks to our expanding community! What's next on the horizon \u2013 $7.5M or $8M? pic.twitter.com/yIiutjmR81 \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 18, 2024 DOGEVERSE will operate on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, a multichain feature that supporters will drive prices in 2024.

The world\u2019s two largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether were both threatening breakouts below key psychologically important levels earlier this week. Many traders have become more pessimistic about the near-term outlook given rising macro and geopolitical headwinds ahead of the halving. But Bitcoin has since rebounded to near $64,000 and Ether to near $3,100. In wake of Bitcoin\u2019s strong bounce from $60,000 support, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy now for quick gains.

That\u2019s also evident when looking at futures market. As per coinglass.com, the funding rate paid by traders taking out leveraged Bitcoin long positions recently dipped to multi-month lows. Open interest (i.e. the USD value of outstanding leveraged futures positions) has also declined substantially from recent highs. A less frothy market suggests a more stable foundation from which the Bitcoin price can stage a rebound. That could explain the strength of Thursday\u2019s rally, which has likely caught some off guard. With many altcoins well down from recent highs but the market now rebounding, the potential is there for quick gains. Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Thursday that could be the best crypto to buy now. Best Crypto to Buy Now Injective (INJ) Decentralized trading protocol Injective (INJ) is gaining momentum as the market rebounds and is eyeing a retest of $30 resistance. As per CoinMarketCap, the token was last up around 14% in 24 hours, with a $2.7 billion market cap. Stake $INJ and Chill https://t.co/Uu8gAEkueD \u2014 Injective (@injective) April 17, 2024 No specific catalyst appears behind the cryptos outperformance. However, news that the number of staked INJ tokens continues to rise is a good sign for the protocol. Its modest valuation suggests there remains plenty of room for the crypto to 5 or 10x from here. It could easily be the best crypto to buy now. Gala (GALA) Play-to-earn blockchain gaming platform Gala (GALA) is attempting to continue a rebound from its recent dip. Last at $0.04380, GALA is up 12% in 24 hours and 30% from last week\u2019s sub-$0.033 lows. The GALA price got crushed last week amid the broader market sell-off and after bearish pennant breakout. GALA could be the best crypto to buy now if it can break above this key level. Source: TradingView But if GALA can overcome resistance at $0.050, a swift recovery back to early yearly highs near $0.088 is possible. GALA could well be the best crypto to buy now. Akash Network (AKT) Decentralized computing resource network Akash Network (AKT) is attempting to break out of its recent downtrend. AKT was last trading near $4.0, up 11% in the past 24 hours. The token is still down around 40% from its yearly highs at $6.50, having been battered since late March. But AKT is looking to break out of its recent downtrend. A break above the 21DMA at $4.20 could open the door to a pop higher to resistance-turned-support at $5.0. As AKT eyes a retest of this key level, it could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingView The prospect of quick potential gains means AKT could be the best crypto to buy now. Alternate Investment Strategy to Consider All of the above coins offer investors a great chance of making near-term gains. Indeed, altcoin investing can be very profitable if investors can reliably find undervalued projects and time the market well. However, attempting to time the market comes with a lot of risks, given the high level of volatility in the altcoin market. An alternative strategy that carries less risks relating to market volatility is investing in crypto presales or ICOs. Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fund raising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token. These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors. Of course, presale investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket. But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains. Here are some of the top presales being watched by analysts at Cryptonews. 19 Best Crypto Presale Projects for April 2024 The post Best Crypto to Buy Now April 18 \u2013 Injective, Gala, Akash Network appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"As cryptocurrency prices bounce on Thursday in wake of the bulls putting up a strong defense of the $60,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and $3,000 Ether (ETH) levels a day earlier, investors are hunting for smaller, lesser-known altcoins that could be the best crypto to buy now to deliver quick gains.

Crunchbase data published today reveals that Web3 startups managed to secure just under $1.9 billion in funding across 346 deals in the first quarter of 2024. This marks a significant 58% increase from the previous quarter, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the lingering downward trajectory of overall crypto VC interest. Crypto VC Funding Rises Amid Growing Optimism The latest surge in funding can be attributed to investors with a more long-term perspective on Web3, in contrast to the hype-driven \u201ctourist investors\u201d who were prevalent in recent years. According to Chris Metinko, the author of the report, these investors are currently focusing their attention on the AI sector, indicating a shift in investment strategy. Metinko explains that there is a growing interest in supporting the underlying infrastructure of the decentralized internet, rather than solely focusing on crypto wallets and lenders, which garnered substantial investments during the peak period of 2021 to 2022. Although big funding rounds were relatively rare in Q1, a few notable investments stood out. Exohood Labs, a company merging AI, quantum computing, and blockchain, secured a $112 million seed round at a valuation of $1.4 billion. EigenLabs, an Ether token \u201crestaking\u201d platform, raised $100 million in a Series B led by a16z crypto. Additionally, Freechat, a decentralized social network built on blockchain technology, secured $80 million in a Series A round. These investments, along with others, contributed to the rise in valuations and the emergence of four new Web3 unicorns in Q1. Next Few Quarters Will Be Crucial Despite the recent progress, the future of Web3 remains uncertain. Metinko suggests that the next few quarters will be crucial for determining the industry\u2019s direction. While investors anticipate a bounce-back in investment as the decentralized internet continues to develop, it may take another year for venture capital activity to stabilize after the exuberance of 2021. Factors such as the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the upcoming Bitcoin halving could also impact the market, as the prices of Bitcoin and Ether have been on the rise. A recent example of significant funding in the Web3 space is Monad Labs\u2019 successful round, which secured $225 million led by Paradigm. Monad Labs is a layer-1 blockchain compatible with Ethereum that offers faster transaction processing. This funding round evokes memories of the golden era of crypto funding in 2021-2022 when L1 solutions attracted substantial investments. Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada, has revealed that it has once again achieved $2 billion in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody. Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody expanded by nearly 248% in the second half of 2023. According to analysts at Bernstein Research, crypto funds could reach a staggering $500 billion to $650 billion within the next five years, a significant leap from the current valuation of approximately $50 billion.

Its market capitalization is $1.3 trillion, and it currently commands 54% of the market share. Over the last 24 hours, the BTC price has experienced a 1.2% increase. As for its circulating supply, 19.46 million BTC are in circulation out of a maximum possible supply of 21 million BTC.

If BTC\u2019s price successfully holds its momentum above $64,438, it will fuel a bullish rally to $68,705. If bulls fail to initiate a surge, BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $59,771, which may begin a bearish trend to $53,746. Is Bitcoin A Good Investment? Bitcoin has historically presented the opportunity for significant returns due to its decentralized nature. Bitcoin also holds the potential to act as an asset that does not correlate with the broader market trends, akin to gold. This characteristic suggests that it could move independently of other assets such as stocks. Additionally, the recent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it a good investment option with bright market potential. Recent BTC News/Opinions Blackrock\u2019s IBIT: Blackrock has a Bitcoin fund called the Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This fund, which deals with Bitcoin directly, has increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than 252,011 BTC. This means the fund\u2019s Bitcoin is worth about $18 billion now. There\u2019s a big increase in interest from small investors, more than what Blackrock\u2019s boss thought would happen.

BTC Price Overview The price of Bitcoin had experienced notable peaks and troughs in its value. Despite this volatility, the unique nature of the Bitcoin network and its limited supply of coins has attracted the attention of investors and traders worldwide. The blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial systems. In recent years, Bitcoin has trended upwards, with significant increases in value occurring in 2017 and 2021. This growth has been driven by a variety of factors, including increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment, as well as speculation by investors and traders. Today, Bitcoin is trading at +56654654.6% above its all-time low in July 2010. While the future of Bitcoin\u2019s price remains uncertain, many experts predict that the trend towards increased adoption and acceptance of digital currencies will continue to drive demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC Price history Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price again reached an all-time high in 2021, as values exceeded over 65,000 USD in November 2021. That particular price hike was connected to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States, whilst others in 2021 were due to events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively. Tesla\u2019s announcement in March 2021 that it had acquired 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of the digital coin fueled mass interest. The market was noticeably different by the end of 2022, however, with Bitcoin prices reaching roughly $17194.91 as of January 10, 2023, after another crypto exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy. Large BTC holders \u2013 \u2018whales\u2019 \u2013 are said to make up two percent of anonymous ownership accounts, and own approx 92 percent of BTC. As most people who use cryptocurrency-related services worldwide are retail clients rather than institutional investors, Bitcoin prices are difficult to measure, as movements from one large whale already have a significant impact on this market. More on Bitcoin What is Bitcoin? Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency powered by blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto created the coin to overcome the shortcomings of government-issued currencies without requiring a controlling authority. Bitcoin (BTC) was created out of the need for a cryptography-based e-payment system rather than the conventional trust-based system. Cryptocurrency acts as a store of value and a payment method for any transaction process in the crypto space. It is often dubbed \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s current cryptography is based on an impenetrable algorithm (SHA-256) designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, after the collapse of the SHA-1 algorithm. This algorithm makes it impossible to crack the Bitcoin network. Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, its value has risen dramatically, from less than 0.01 USD in May 2010 to over 67,000 USD in November 2021. Bitcoin is expected to attain newer feats in the coming years as more institutional investors and traders continue to turn to cryptocurrency. What Influences Bitcoin\u2019s Price? The world\u2019s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently taken a substantial hit, dipping below the $25.5K threshold and reaching its lowest value in three months. This downward trend follows a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The news of this legal dispute sparked a swift wave of Bitcoin selling, causing a ripple effect across the majority of other cryptocurrencies. The market strain has escalated as the SEC has expanded its legal pursuits to encompass Coinbase, another key contender in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Crypto experts posit that if Bitcoin can hold its resistance level at $26,000, we might see a bounce back in the coming months. However, if this level is breached, Bitcoin could potentially tumble to its lowest ever value of $20,000. Yet, the experts also caution that the current rise in interest rates and a more stringent monetary policy might hinder Bitcoin from making a significant recovery in the near term. Despite these hurdles, the year 2023 holds promise for Bitcoin advocates who see it as a \u201cdigital safe-haven\u201d or \u201cvirtual gold\u201d. These enthusiasts are confident that Bitcoin can offer investors a substantial hedge or attractive yields during periods of market instability. Bitcoin Challenges Despite its success, Bitcoin has faced several criticisms, especially its energy-hungry mining system. According to an energy consumption tracker developed by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 100 TWh per year, about one-third of the UK\u2019s total energy consumption in 2016. In addition, BTC\u2019s criminality potential has positioned it for more scrutiny, as it has facilitated numerous dark web dealings, such as acquiring illegal weapons, money laundering, etc. The most significant and long-standing challenge of Bitcoin is scalability. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology limits its performance in terms of transaction completion timeframe, with an insufficient capacity of 3-7 TPS. As more transactions are initiated on the network, processing delays will surface. Several proposals have been put forward to nip this concern in the bud, but a favorable long-term fix remains unclear. How do you buy and sell Bitcoin? You can buy and sell Bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms. To purchase Bitcoin, you typically need to create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, fund your account, and place an order to buy Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin\u2019s role in the broader financial system? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen by some as a disruptive force that could challenge traditional financial systems and provide greater financial freedom and autonomy for users. Where to store Bitcoin? The best ways to store Bitcoin include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and software wallets. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure, as they store private keys offline and require physical confirmation of transactions. Paper wallets, which involve printing out private keys and keeping them in a secure location, are also considered secure but require careful handling. Software wallets, which run on computers or mobile devices, are a great option, but more vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks. What drives the value of BTC? Bitcoin\u2019s value is determined by supply and demand factors, such as market sentiment, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor speculation. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, scarcity, and high-security features also contribute to its value in the market. Conclusion Bitcoin has gained the mainstream adoption following massive interest from institutional giants. Some companies, like the Spanish firm Telefonica, now accept Bitcoin. Telefonica even works with a cryptocurrency exchange called Bit2Me to let people pay with Bitcoin. Looking ahead, Bitcoin seems to have a bright future with potential for its price to go up. This prediction is based on Bitcoin\u2019s past prices and current market sentiment. Adding Bitcoin to your investment portfolio could be a good move, but it\u2019s important to do your research and understand the risks before buying Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency","article_summary":"BTC Price Predictions 2024-2033 How much is Bitcoin (BTC) worth?

At the moment of fuss and angst over European immigrants, Mr. Hall will suggest the application of AI facial recognition technology at Kent migrant facilities. This statement forms part of the biannual initiative to improve the process of migrants boarding small boats, with the main goal of assessing individuals for any reported threats. Using facial recognition technology will provide the border officers with a platform through which they will promptly have the terror suspects identified as soon as they disembark in the database, streamlining the process. The technology will help prevent individuals who have been found to present security threats. Challenges at migrant processing centers The suggestion comes from some inefficiency evident at the processing centers, which results in overcrowding at camps like the Manston, where Hall said that the volumes of migrants were released before the thorough check could be conducted. The center, besides, puts Western Jet Foil in Dover to be on the receiving end, especially when there is a surge, and the number of migrants is more than anticipated, which would fragment the screening process and compromise its efficiency. As he did, Hall pointed out that the confinement of prisoners in these places is geographically limited and that there are ethical standards of behavior they should maintain. Closing my tent doesn\u2019t help, whereas if I\u2019m jamming everyone into the same tent, they can stay there only for a day. Additionally, speedy screening methods that do not infringe on people\u2019s basic rights are a dire issue that needs to be addressed now. Implementation of facial recognition technology Implementation of facial recognition technology will soon be part of a trial carried out at Border Force, which is at the Western Jet Foil, a primary vitality intake in Dover. It sets up a process that immediately checks the face of the person in real-time against the integrated database containing the images recorded as suspected to be of terrorists. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, it\u2019ll be in print. However, in my report, I\u2019ll posit that WJF should use facial recognition at the time of boarding so they can screen them off as soon as passengers disembark.\u201d Hall declared it in the LBC interview. These tests will thus be conducted immediately following arrival. They will address a present gap caused by income processing delays and the large numbers of immigrants continuously arriving in Europe. Hall\u2019s plan offers to impart skills to border officials, thereby enabling them to make conscious decisions and do so rapidly, which consequently leads to apprehending suspects on watch lists before they gain access to the country. Balancing security with Humanitarian Concerns Technology being used in this process raises the important issue of wanting to secure the migrants while keeping them humane. Hence, the UK government needs to walk the fine line between taking robust security measures while respecting international human rights standards to come up with the middle option, which appeared to be the core of Hall\u2019s advice. This year, the Home Office has revealed plans to use facial recognition technology while continuing to implement a wider legislative package designed to guide and limit cross-Channel migration. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak frequently emphasizes his intention to put a stop to the boats, and his government closely follows these declarations by introducing appropriate laws. Some of them, like the plan for deportation to Rwanda, prove to be very controversial. Yet despite these movements\u2019 aims and achieving to some extent, they have remained stalled in the final stages of the legislative issues, thus showing the complicated and sometimes conflict-prone policy nature of immigration. More than 6,200 of those crossings were recorded from the start of the year, which was already more than what we had in previous years. The reality of the need for proper border management systems is now more evident than ever. The suggested use of AI-based facial recognition as a surveillance measure at the most critically guarded access points in Kent could become a decisive trend in how the border area of the UK is managed against impending and possibly dangerous intruders. The government\u2019s responses to this system, when it analyzes Hall\u2019s rapport, are doubtful in the context of the use of these technologies, and the smooth fitting of the processes of security deterrence with the ethical and legal concerns is unbeautiful. This acts as a precursor for other nations huddled up with the same security dilemma in the middle of the extreme migration tendencies across the globe.

The plan includes expanding into many international locations and releasing a newly designed stablecoin US dollar-backed product to further extend its role in the global cryptocurrency market while attending to an intriguing challenge of the regulatory framework, especially in the States. Ripple eyes expansion with US dollar-backed stablecoin launch Ripple is setting its aim beyond the United States, but this doesn\u2019t mean it will supersede the markets (95% of its customers are currently international) where it does the bulk of its business around the globe. This strategic shift addresses the slower U.S. market adoption issue, which is primarily caused by the tighter and more extensive regulatory framework. Garlinghouse highlights the dramatic growth in these markets overseas and its importance in driving the company\u2019s globally focused expansion. Expansion becomes the next plan for the company as it may launch the US dollar-backed stablecoin. By adopting a new foreign currency, the bank reacts to the emerging trend of the stablecoin market, which is currently worth $150 billion and is expected to enjoy immense growth. The underlying focus of Garlinghouse\u2019s claim is to integrate traditional banking with cutting-edge crypto technology by creating an instrument of security, regulation, and worldwide access. Boosting XRP\u2019s utility Ripple\u2019s operation lies successively on XRP, the digital asset that acts as a startup\u2019s payment protocol. Garlinghouse was convinced about the prospects of XRP, and he stressed at the same time that the star of Ripple as a brand depended on the widespreadness of its broader solution set. The XRP utilization in global payments and transfers to the advantage of Ripple results in the company\u2019s staying power and relevance in digital currencies. All this constitutes solely a part of Ripple\u2019s plan to have its infrastructure become a formidable system across the world\u2019s financial industry, and that is why efficiently working XRP is being looked after. Navigating regulatory hurdles However, Ripple is grappling with constant regulatory issues, an environmental problem from the United States Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) that forces them to make operational and strategic decisions differently. The still ongoing legal battles show that breaking blockchain and current financial regulation frameworks is not a simple matter to do. Despite this, Garlinghouse remained dedicated to compliance and regulatory engagement. He is convinced that such measures provide much-needed support for XRP\u2019s high growth and would make the cryptocurrency appealing to investors searching for compliant virtual assets. This approach is primarily targeted at maintaining Ripple\u2019s existence and producing power within the financial ecosystem, which is increasing with scrutiny and calls for more regulations. After three years of Garlinghouse\u2019s leadership, Ripple will emphasize harnessing the opportunity the growing global market provides, the forthcoming strategic stablecoin, and the development and implementation of XRP\u2019s utility. Despite the roadblocks created by regulator prostrations, Ripple is prepared to pave the way to deal with these loopholes and set the standard example of compliance and innovations in the cryptocurrency industry. This adaptive strategy is a testament to Ripple\u2019s determination to serve as a pioneer for years to come in the constantly changing financial sector by offering cryptocurrency solutions that are technologically ahead and link traditional financial networks with modernly developed financial structures.","article_summary":"A detailed interview with the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, explained the future-looking growth strategy of the cryptocurrency company within the next three years on FOX Business.

With Rick Osterloh, who was previously an executive at Google, playing the leadership part and the consolidation of the hardware group, the aim of this integration will be to clip the wings of any operational overshadow and fill every shade of innovation. Pichai, the company\u2019s CEO, confidently stated that this integration dwarfs the Android and Chrome bases and will thus boost the aims of making artificial intelligence more broad in the organization. The move not only reflects a change from Google\u2019s previous opinion of separating androids from hardware but also shows a shift in its perspective. This strategic move started at the level of ensuring fair competition for all producers of Android-based phones. Nevertheless, over the present years, Google has decided to employ its Pixel devices as showcases for AI capabilities with the intention of using hardware and software functions together in order to discover new horizons of possibilities. Leading the way in consumer technology innovation In an interview with The Verge, Osterloh noted that the AI technology will be leading all major integration for the phones, and will be shaping the future of mobile technology. The Pixel camera, however, acts as a key example for this purpose, drawing on AI algorithms to improve photos, particularly in low-light conditions and when selecting images. According to Osterloh, deep AI integration is critical, with evidence of how it has completely changed interactions and has influenced the way we perceive services. Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner, also indicated the fact that Google\u2019s aim is not just to rule the AI world as a consumer as well as in a big enterprise sector. AI incorporation to all aspects of its products and services by Google is the crucial step towards its aim to be the top player in AI economy where things are beginning to move. Leadership Restructuring and Prospects for Future One of such changes is the participation of Hiroshi Lockheimer, the head of Google software division having taken up no other title (so far) and is working on the project, which still unrevealed. Nevertheless, while Lockheimer and Osterloh still affirmed that their departures were made on strategic rather than working rival grounds, the rumors of a power struggle had still greatly spread. In addition to merging the AI research and responsibility teams with the consumer-facing divisions, Google is also indicating deeper AI-driven innovation to be a part of their strategy. Although the effect of these organizational changes on consumer products in the present moment is hardly noticeable, its future implication for emerging AI-enabled technologies is evident. This demonstrates that Google\u2019s strategy to unify its software and hardware operations is evidence of the motion of AI towards its own entrant point. This will lead to the creation of a highly interdisciplinary team at Google, and in effect, it will help to accelerate innovations and make the company a market leader in the growing era of technology.

The new model is named VASA-1, and it requires only one portrait style picture and an audio file of voice and fuses them together to make a short video of a talking head with facial expressions, lip syncing, and head movements. The produced head can even sing songs, and that in the voice uploaded at the time of creation. Microsoft VASA-1 is a breakthrough for animation According to Microsoft, the new AI model is still in the research phase, and there are still no plans to release it to the general public, and only Microsoft researchers have access to it. However, the company shared quite a few samples of the demonstrations, which show stunning realism and lip movements that seem to be too lifelike. Source: Microsoft. The demo shows people who look real, as if they were sitting in front of a camera and getting filmed. The movements of the heads are realistic and look quite natural, and the lip movement to match the audio is quite outstanding, provided that there seems very little to be noted anything for not being natural. The overall mouth synchronization is phenomenal. Microsoft said the model was developed to animate virtual characters, and it claimed that all the people shown in the demo are synthetic, as they said, the models were generated from DALL-E, which is the image generator of OpenAI. So we think if it can animate an AI generated model, then obviously there is much more potential in it to animate photos of any real person, which should be more realistic and much easier for it to handle. Use cases of Vasa-1 and its potential misuse Source: Microsoft. If we look at the potential of VASA-1 for practical usage, then on the baseline, it can be used to animate characters in animated movies, which will give characters a more realistic feel with natural facial expressions and head movements. Another use could be in video games, for the very same reason, think of Grand Theft Auto and the like. In the future it may be used for hyper realistic AI generated movies or series where characters can be generated from image generators and could be animated by VASA-1, and the audience may not even feel that the characters are not humans. Along with creative use of the tool, it can also be leveraged to create content for malicious purposes. The potential misuse of VASA-1 could be its utilization for deepfakes, as it will make it easy for anyone involved in deepfake creations to scale up their bad tactics and generate more realistic misguiding content. Remember the robocall scandal involving Biden\u2019s voice to refrain people from voting before a primary election? Now it could be a robovideo after the robocall, and that with very realistic human expressions. The potential risk of misuse is may be the reason that Microsoft has limited its testing to its researchers only. According to Microsoft researchers, the tool can be used for creating misleading and deceivable content for impersonating humans, like some other tools, but they are aiming for positive use applications. Nvidia and Runway AI have also released their models for the same function, but VASA-1 seems far more realistic and a promising candidate. The research paper can be seen here, and Microsoft\u2019s note here.","article_summary":"In a recent white paper, Microsoft introduced a new AI model that produces a talking head that looks and sounds realistic and is generated by only uploading a still photograph and a voice sample.

Similarly, the Polkadot price has faced pressures, unable to breach crucial technical barriers. Contrastingly, BlockDAG emerges prominently, leveraging its innovative mining solutions to redefine cryptocurrency mining. With a whopping $18.1 Million raised in its presale and an additional $2.2 million from miner sales, BlockDAG positions itself as a top crypto for 2024. These advancements, coupled with a recent keynote teaser from the moon, underscore BlockDAG\u2019s potential for a transformative 20,000x ROI, sparking substantial investor interest in this burgeoning sector. Cardano\u2019s Market Dynamics: Observing Whale Movements Recent trends have seen a notable decline in Cardano\u2019s market value, with a 19.8% drop stirring concerns among investors. This downturn prompts a deeper analysis of the activities of Cardano Whales, whose recent behaviours suggest a strategic accumulation of ADA. Observations indicate that these large holders are purchasing substantial amounts of ADA. Despite these purchases potentially marking a price bottom for ADA, the intentions behind these movements remain crucial to understand. The surge in Cardano Whales\u2019 activity, particularly their timing, could signify a strong vote of confidence in Cardano\u2019s future or a temporary strategic play. As Cardano fights to maintain its top-ten status by market cap, the actions of Cardano Whales will be instrumental in shaping its path forward in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. Polkadot\u2019s Struggle Amid Market Uncertainty Polkadot continues to face downward pressure, mirroring the broader crypto market\u2019s reaction to geopolitical tensions. Despite starting the day at $9.05, the Polkadot price couldn\u2019t surpass the 20-day SMA barrier and closed at $8.66 after a 4.31% drop. The subsequent days saw further declines, with Polkadot price breaching crucial support levels and dipping below $7 amid intensified bearish sentiment. As the market fluctuates, Polkadot tests crucial support and resistance levels. If buyers regain strength, the next target could be the $7 resistance marked by the 200-day SMA, with the current price hovering around $6.70. However, failure to surpass this could lead to a fallback to $6.50, highlighting the ongoing tug-of-war between buyers and sellers in determining the future trajectory of the Polkadot price. BlockDAG\u2019s 20,000 ROI Leads the Charge in Crypto Innovation BlockDAG is transforming the cryptocurrency mining landscape through significant advancements in mining technology.

The SNX token is an ERC20 token, and therefore it is compatible with ETH wallets. Besides facilitating activities (specifically to offer collateral) within the Synthetix network, SNX holders can become SNX stakers by staking their SNX coins to earn staking rewards. Who is the Synthetix founder? Synthetix network was launched in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). Its founder is Kain Warwick. Havven (HAV) rebranded to the current Synthetix name a year later, a name it has maintained to date. Warwick is also the founder of Pouncer, a live auction Australian site, and a non-executive director at Blueshyft retail network. What is the Synthetix network? Synthetix Network is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to trade synthetic assets (synths). The protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it provides liquidity for synth tokens so that traders can seamlessly trade them. The platform enables users to issue and trade synthetic assets \u2014 digital assets that represent other real assets like stocks, fiat currencies, commodities, or cryptocurrencies. It also has a staking mechanism that incentivizes users to provide liquidity and maintain the platform. The Synthetix Protocol was originally conceived as Havven back in 2017 by Kain Warwick. Warwick is currently also a Non-Executive Director of blueshyft- a network of over 1200 retail locations around Australia. SNX is a derivative product In a nutshell, synthetic assets are derivative products issued and traded on DeFi protocols. They are similar to traditional derivative products that derive their value from underlying assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currency, commodities, precious metals, bonds, and stocks. The underlying assets are cataloged onto a DeFi protocol like the Synthetix network through tokenization by using smart contracts. Then the tokens, which represent a certificate of ownership of the real-world assets, are issued to investors and traders who can then go ahead and trade the derived assets without holding the real-world assets. Synthetix\u2019s unique features Synthetix network was among the first blockchain protocols to introduce synthetic crypto assets. The synthetic cryptocurrency assets minted via the Synthetix protocol are synths and have an \u2018s\u2019 at the beginning of their names. If the underlying asset is the USD, for example, the synthetic help on Synthetix would appear as sUSD, BTC would appear as sBTC, ETH would appear as sETH, and so on. The community voted the synths for to exist on the Synthetix protocol. The prices of the underlying assets of the synths are tracked using smart contract price delivery protocols known as oracles. This system ensures no slippage or liquidity issues when trading the synths. To mint a synth on the Synthetix network, a user will have to lock up some SNX tokens in a smart contract. How to Stake SNX If you truly want to make money staking SNX, there are a few easy steps involved. First, you need to buy Synthetix and connect to a web3 wallet. Visit Mintr, the portal interface for minting and managing Synths. Connect your web3 wallet to Mintr. Click \u2018Mint\u2019 and choose what type of Synth you want to mint. Remember to maintain the collateralization ratio. Input the number of Synths you want to mint. Click \u2018Mint Now\u2019. Confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. Afterward, your SNX token will automatically be staked. You will now be able to enjoy rewards generated from trading fees. Furthermore, you are also subject to inflation rewards. Conclusion In evaluating SNX\u2019s worth, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader market sentiment and recent trends. Despite intermittent bullish movements, the overall trajectory appears bearish, with indications of downward pressure. Factors such as oversold RSI values and increasing volatility suggest potential further declines. However, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick\u2019s initiative with Infinex highlights ongoing efforts to innovate and simplify DeFi trading, which could impact SNX\u2019s long-term value. Therefore, while current market conditions may advise caution, broader ecosystem developments could play a significant role in shaping SNX\u2019s future trajectory.","article_summary":"SNX Price Prediction 2024-2033 Synthetix is developing a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that is accessible to various platforms.

Discussing the blue collar works, he said, \u201cWe tend to think of the work that blue collar workers do as being relatively routine, relatively straightforward, relatively process-based, relatively easy.\u201d While talking about white collar work or executive work, he added, \u201cConversely, we think of what white collar workers do as requiring subtler faculties \u2014 things like creativity, judgment, empathy.\u201d Source: Highereddive. About the latter one he said, we presume that AI yet has to advance to recreate these functionalities that only the human brain is capable of. He pointed out that in architecture, medicine, law, and accounting, AI does not need to have this quality, at least for solving some of the issues. Susskind pointed out that our ignorance of this very state of things adds up to the AI fallacy, as he calls it. According to him, our misconception of assuming that copying or replicating is the only way how tasks are performed at the human level, and then we try to develop systems using that approach. AI is encroaching on tasks previously assumed out of its reach Some of the tasks that were traditionally considered to be performed by individuals trained by higher education only, are now possible to be completed with AI due to its strong computing power for processing and analysis. So now there are many activities that we considered to be beyond the capabilities of these technologies that are now possible to be overtaken by them. According to Susskind, it is the domain of white collar work. Susskind advises education and training as the only solution to these emerging changes by preparing people for duties that AI models are still not able to perform. Susskind said, \u201cThere are large areas of human activity that lie beyond the reach of even the most capable technologies.\u201d Susskind highlighted that judgment, empathy, and interpersonal communication are some of the sectors still not taken over by AI, and colleges can train people to build such AI systems that can usurp more activities of humans. Higher education professionals are counting on AI\u2019s capability for the transition of the sector. Many panels at the conference were dedicated to this very topic, and the opportunities, threats, and promises that AI offers were at the top of the trends list of higher ed. Grand Canyon College of Education\u2019s dean, Meredith Critchfield, expressed his views that it does not matter how we perceive AI or how our perspective around it changes over time, what will not change will be the foundation of who we are as institutions.

According to a report from Reuters, the company is laying off some members and restructuring some of its team. The major layoffs will affect staff in the company\u2019s real estate and finance departments. The company is axing employees who work in the treasury, business services, and revenue cash operations of the finance department. Google set to cut more jobs amid restructuring moves In an email to staff, the finance chief at Google Ruth Porath wrote that the company is looking to set up growth hubs in locations like Bangalore, Dublin, and Mexico City. This new development is in line with the company\u2019s plans for restructuring. A spokesperson for Google confirmed that the layoffs are not across its global workers and employees affected could apply for internal roles. However, Google failed to disclose the total number of employees that were affected or the teams it is restructuring. In the report, the spokesperson noted that some of the members would be relocated to these key hubs across the globe. The company is set to increase investments in specific areas worldwide, setting up shop in India, Chicago, Atlanta, and some other strategic locations. The report noted that teams across the company had changed since 2023 up till now to increase their efficiency and assign resources to the biggest priorities. Other tech giants announce layoffs This recent development is coming after a few layoffs at the firm earlier this year. Google announced the sack of specific employees including engineering hardware and assistant teams as it looked to focus on building the capacity of its artificial intelligence (AI). Its sister company Alphabet, through its CEO Sundar Pichai, noted that more jobs within Google will be affected. He noted that the firm was looking to create investment capacity, hence the need to make tough choices. Apple announced the layoffs of about 600 employees at the beginning of this month in its self-driving cars and smartwatch screen teams. The layoffs became necessary after the company axed both programs. Amazon Web Services also cut some jobs as a part of its broader efforts to help its parent company. The company laid off more than hundreds of employees across several departments last month.","article_summary":"Industry giant Google has announced a fresh round of layoffs in a bid to cut costs.

Calculated probabilities were calculated by Greg @ learnmeabitcoin.com Block 840,000 is not just another block in the blockchain; it triggers the Bitcoin halving where the block reward is reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, cutting the amount of BTC mined each day in half. You don\u2019t have to be a Princeton economist to understand the impact this will have on the supply and demand dynamics for bitcoin. Beyond the obvious halving of the block reward, a new market has developed around Ordinals which could have a significant impact on what happens to the first block of the halving. Contained within the first block of the halving is an extremely rare \u201cepic sat\u201d. While Ordinals have divided some Bitcoiners on their merit, there is no arguing the impact they have had on Bitcoin.and it raises an important question, could Ordinals cause a blockchain reorg? Through this article we will dig into the basics of a reorg, Ordinals demand, how mining probabilities work, and finally who could pull off a successful reorg. Before we dig into this \u201cepic sat\u201d, let\u2019s build an understanding of what a reorg is. The Bitcoin blockchain is a slow and dumb database that creates blocks of data every 10 minutes or so. It continues working as intended, but occasionally, things get tense. When two miners find blocks nearly simultaneously, it creates a temporary fork in the blockchain. This moment of overlap leads to a brief period of uncertainty. These forks are resolved by the network through the longest chain rule, which is when the fork tip of the blockchain with more proof-of-work (the longest chain or aka more blocks) will be adopted as the valid chain. Orphaned blocks from the shorter chain are not included in the longer one, and the transactions they contain are returned to the mempool to be included in future blocks. This process of one chain becoming longer than the other and becoming the accepted version is known as a reorganization, or reorg. Click the image above to subscribe! Due to the incentive structures built into Bitcoin mining, reorgs are usually resolved as soon as the next block is found and added to the tip of one of the forked chains. This is because finding a block is extremely difficult, and miners are incentivized to work on the longest chain in order to build the next block, and get paid. If they are mining on the short fork, the rest of the network will leave them behind and they will have invalid blocks. The last thing you would want is to build a block that is rejected by the network because you\u2019ve built a block on a chain and are rejected by the network due to the longest chain rule. During the reorg period of a fork, miners build on whichever chain fork hits their node first and try to build a block to get the longest chain. Now don\u2019t get worried about reorgs. They happen every couple of months (on average) and typically involve one or two blocks. These short reorgs are part of the network\u2019s regular operation and quickly resolve without any significant impact on the network and its users. It\u2019s worth noting that deep reorgs that consist of many blocks are rare and, correspondingly, more disruptive. They can be triggered by a network split such as what happened in the Blocksize wars, or a new large miner coming to the network, or an attempt to double-spend transactions (this is very rare). Most Recent Reorgs Source: Learn Me A Bitcoin The Bitcoin protocol and its incentives are designed so that there\u2019s a low likelihood of deep reorgs occurring. Consensus rules and incentives are meant to keep the network stable and secure. For example, most exchanges and payment processors require that a transaction be confirmed by a set number of times\u2014usually six or more\u2014before a transaction can be considered final, thus greatly reducing the chances of it being unwound by a reorg. Small reorgs happen and are mundane and frequent operations within the Bitcoin blockchain, but large reorgs are notable and very irregular. About That Epic Sat You\u2019ve probably heard the buzz about Ordinals, that is \u201ca numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and transferring individual sats\u201d. Some argue that Ordinals are a scam and they have no place in Bitcoin, but here\u2019s the thing, an emerging market is rapidly growing around Ordinals. For now, they are here, and they are getting attention from miners, devs, VC, collectors, scammers, and haters alike. When it comes to Ordinals, they are classified by their \u201crarity\u201d and markets determine value. Ordinals rarity levels: + common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block + uncommon: The first sat of each block + rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period + epic: The first sat of each halving epoch + legendary: The first sat of each cycle + mythic: The first sat of the genesis block If we consider the scenario where all Bitcoin has been mined, which implies that all 21 million bitcoins (or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis) are in circulation, we can calculate the total quantity of each level of Ordinals: Uncommon: There would be a total of 6,929,999 uncommon satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each block. Rare: There would be a total of approximately 3,437 rare satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each difficulty adjustment period. Epic: There would be a total of 32 epic satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each halving epoch. Legendary: There would be approximately 5 legendary satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each cycle (noting a slight approximation due to division). Mythic: There is 1 mythic satoshi, which is the first sat of the genesis block. These figures give an overview of how the rarity classifications would distribute across the total supply of satoshis once all Bitcoin is mined, showcasing the unique and scarce nature of certain satoshis within the Bitcoin network. The Ordinals Market and Beyond Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve seen rapid development in Ordinals technology and markets. Ordinals markets first emerged in Discord back channels where OTC deals were being made, but as demand has grown, digital marketplaces have developed for buying and selling Ordinals. US Based Magisat.io lists various types of Ordinals and has Rare sats listed for a staggering 3.49 BTC. This valuation has led to the creation of additional inventory of Ordinals beyond the category that was first described in the Ordinals documentation. Current Market on Magisat.io for standard Ordinals Stats as of 2-15-2024 This data shows that there is a small but growing demand for Ordinals. You can see the volume for Rare amd Uncommon Ordinals are greater than 26 BTC at the time of writing this. Keep in mind that this is only one marketplace and there are a growing number of OTC deals that are happening between buyers and sellers not to mention demand and business happening in other parts of the world. Looking beyond Ordinals marketplaces we are now seeing Ordinals make their way to legendary auction house Sotheby\u2019s further propelling the phenomenon towards the mainstream. If you look across the Pacific Ocean there is also significant demand for Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which would not be possible without Ordinals. So the demand for Ordinals is real and it is growing, not waning. The last significant item of note that could impact demand for this first block of the halving is the activation of Runes. Runes is another protocol released by the same creator of Ordinals, but the aim of Runes is to make a more efficient token protocol. The kicker on this is that with it going live in the first block of the halving, this alone will cause a significant demand to issue these new tokens as quickly as possible, presumably the first Runes issued will be more valuable than later issued Runes. \u201cYes there will be reorg incentive for block 840,000, but it's not for epic sat -- it's for the 20btc in fees from Casey's Runes.\u201d said Charlie Spears on X. This fee revenue call is speculation but it comes from observation from previous Ordinals and BRC20 activity. Sifting For Sats In Bitcoin, \"dust\" refers to an amount of bitcoin so small that it cannot be spent because the cost of a transaction fee would be higher than the amount itself. The concept of a \"dust limit\" therefore varies depending on the transaction fee and the type of transaction being made. However, there are general guidelines for what is considered dust, based on the type of Bitcoin script or address being used. The dust limit is calculated based on the size of the inputs and outputs that make up a transaction. For a transaction to be relayed by most nodes and mined, its outputs must be above the dust limit. The dust limit for a standard P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) transaction output is commonly considered to be 546 satoshis when using the default minimum relay fee of 1 satoshi per byte, but this can vary depending on the network conditions and the policies of individual nodes. For different script types, the dust limit calculation takes into account the size of the script and therefore can vary: P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash): This is the most common type, and its dust limit is usually around 546 satoshis. P2SH (Pay-to-Script Hash): Outputs for P2SH transactions can have a slightly higher dust limit because the script itself is more complex, requiring more data to be included in a transaction. P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key Hash) and P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script Hash): These SegWit (Segregated Witness) transactions have different weight calculations, leading to lower fees for the same amount of data. Consequently, the dust limit for SegWit transactions can be lower than for traditional P2PKH transactions. For P2WPKH, the dust limit might be closer to 294 satoshis. MultiSig: Transactions involving multiple signatures (MultiSig) have higher dust limits due to the increased data size required to accommodate multiple signatures. The exact dust limit can vary because it depends on the transaction's size and the current fee market. Additionally, changes in Bitcoin's protocol or node policies can affect these thresholds. It's also worth noting that some wallets and services might set their own dust limits based on their operational requirements. Pools Sifting Based on the information above we can examine blocks found by pools to see if pools are actively sifting blocks. What we see is 44% of the network is or has sifted for sats in the past year. We have reason to believe that additional pools are in discussions with sifting technology developers in deploying the tech on their pools, but nothing has been made public at this time. Our findings reveal that a very significant percentage of the mining network sees value in sifting for these sats, otherwise this would be a hobbyist endeavor. When this many big players are participating, you know there is some market dynamics happening. Source: Mempool.space as of 2-12-2024, ranking as of past 6 months Beyond blockchain investigation outlined above, miners are developing new markets of their own in mining irregular transactions for various projects. Most notably is publicluy traded mining pool Marathon who launched a new service called Slipstream which will mine complex transactions such as 1 sat UTXO which is far below the SEGWIT dust threshold of 546 sats. I bring this up because as they are offering this service, you can\u2019t help but assume that Marathon sees or will soon see value in Ordinals of they are willing to invest resources in serving Ordinal or Ordinal adjacent projects with this service. Afterall, the obligation of publicly traded companies is to maximize value for shareholders. We know more than 40% of hashrate is sifting for sats, but what does that really mean in the grand scheme of things. Afterall, we are talking about one specific sat, the epic sat in block 840,000. We know that Ordinals have value according to the very small market, we also know that this sat will likely be sold for more than a single blocks reward, but the big question is who could forcibly win this block? Proof of Work is all about the longest chain and ethics don\u2019t matter when it comes to Bitcoin and the blockchain. The chain is truth, even if you were to reorg. If you are hashing and following consensus and you build a longer chain then you are the victor. Based on the table from the previous section, we can see who the top pools are from the past six months. With that information we can model the probability of these pools forking and causing a reorg of the blockchain in order to win the epic sat but we need to run the numbers. For this we will explore the mining section of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Mining Explained in the Whitepaper Bitcoin mining is a race to find a valid block by solving a cryptographic puzzle, known as proof of work. The difficulty of this puzzle is adjusted by the network so that, on average, a new block is found every 10 minutes, regardless of the total computing power of the network. Now the security of this is where things get interesting. Section 11 of the Bitcoin whitepaper discusses the mathematics behind the security of the blockchain against attackers who try to alter the transaction history. The paper uses a comparison to a gambler's \"ruin problem\" to explain how difficult it is for an attacker to catch up with the rest of the network once they fall behind in the race to add new blocks to the chain. Essentially, if honest nodes control more computational power, the probability that an attacker can catch up decreases rapidly as they fall further behind in the blockchain. The probability that an attacker can catch up becomes almost zero if they do not have a majority of the computational power. The section outlines the process where transactions become more secure as new blocks are added to the blockchain, using a Poisson distribution to model the likelihood of an attacker catching up from being behind the chain tip. This framework provides the basis for understanding how blockchain achieves security through probabilistic means not absolute guarantees. In the Bitcoin whitepaper, the Poisson distribution is used to model the security of mining. It's used to quantify the probability that an attacker can catch up with the honest nodes after being z blocks behind, which is vital when considering the risk of a blockchain reorganization. It offers a statistical view of how likely it is for an attacker, with a certain percentage of the total network hash rate, to rewrite the blockchain history. Converting to C code... #include double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z) { double p = 1.0 - q; double lambda = z * (q / p); double sum = 1.0; int i, k; for (k = 0; k <= z; k++) { double poisson = exp(-lambda); for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) poisson *= lambda / i; sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k)); } return sum; } Who Could Pull This Off? Ordinals introduces a new incentive to reorg. Before Ordinals, the threat of a reorg was focused around a double spend attack, but Ordinals introduced the demand for individual sats, in this case the demand to win a specific block. The question is this, does the value of a single Epic sat or block warrant abandoning the longest chain in hopes of finding a couple quick blocks and winning that epic sat? Pubco mining pools will have a hard time justifying such action to shareholders, it seems negligent. But for private mining pools, they have different incentives and have a bit more freedom in how they pursue revenue. Looking at the top 10 mining pools by their percent of the network, we can model out who could pull off a reorg. One thing of note, the formulas described in the whitepaper only model catching up with the chain tip, however a reorg would require catching up to the tip +1 block, so our values below show that probability. The first thing I noticed was Foundry and Antpool have a higher % probability of pulling off a reorg from 1 block behind than their own % hashrate of the network. How could this be possible? This is because A miner with 30% of the hashrate being 1 block behind and attempting a reorg is at a disadvantage because the rest of the network (70% hashrate) collectively has a higher probability of extending the current longest chain before the miner can catch up and surpass it. However, due to the randomness captured by the Poisson distribution, there's always a non-zero probability that this miner could, through a streak of good luck, mine enough blocks in a row to take over the longest chain, even from one block behind. This is statistically unlikely but becomes possible with higher hashrate percentages and short reorg depths. The next key takeaway is how successful reorgs become less likely for each block they are behind. It is remarkable how Foundry could still reorg from 5 blocks behind. Conclusion The Bitcoin space is weird (always has been) and bitcoin miners are the longest of long when it comes to outlook on Bitcoin. Based on the reorg probability and the potential value from the additional value on the first block of the halving, the probability of a reorg feels likely. If you take the BTC mined from this block, the epic sat, plus the projected amount of fees that will be earned from the release of Runes, bigger pools would be foolish to not try and make a move to win this block. The only real downside of a reorg would be by working on the old chain and NOT winning the reorg, so you would miss out on possibly winning 1-2 blocks by mining on the original longest chain. I do hope for fireworks. It will be legendary to hear the talk tracks from the new Wall Street financial bros trying to explain this. At the end of the day, miners will have to make a decision, that is to simply build on the longest chain or to try and build the longest chain with heavy amounts of luck. They must consider the tradeoffs and pick their poisson.

For more information on services offered, custody products, and the relationship between Unchained and Bitcoin Magazine, please visit our website. There are many different ways to custody bitcoin, and there isn\u2019t one perfect method that suits everyone in all situations. The amount of bitcoin, the frequency it needs to be accessed, and other factors can determine which approach makes the most sense. The resources and security requirements of individual bitcoin holders will differ from those of institutions. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at how the custody strategies for these two groups compare, and then uncover an important truth about the application of multisig. Custody for individuals For typical individuals looking to hold bitcoin in self-custody, there are a number of tools to choose from. Depending on the situation, a simple singlesig wallet could be sufficient, with the option to add modifications such as seed phrase copying or BIP 39 passphrases. We created an article going into detail on various configurations, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Individuals less concerned with making frequent withdrawals, and looking to secure larger amounts for long-term savings, should consider a multisig wallet. Multisig offers threshold security, which can protect users from single points of failure, ensuring that no funds are lost if any one component of the setup is destroyed, misplaced, or stolen. Achieving threshold security is crucial for anyone who wishes to protect a substantial amount of funds.

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. There are a couple of other methods of threshold security besides multisig, but they are less appropriate for the average person. Shamir\u2019s secret share (SSS) is one method that still leads to temporary single points of failure during the initial setup, and during a withdrawal procedure. Multiparty computation (MPC) is another method which is extremely complicated to safely use. You can learn more about these in our article about threshold security models. Multisig can be combined with SSS or MPC to create multi-level thresholds. Multi-level thresholds refers to a threshold on the blockchain level (multisig) as well as a threshold on the key level (SSS or MPC). By combining these concepts, a fundamental threshold of keys serves as the primary security for bitcoin holdings, and each key can have protection from becoming compromised by using a threshold of its own. Despite a more complicated structure, two levels of thresholds offers clear advantages for keeping bitcoin maximally secure. For a sole individual trying to protect their bitcoin, this approach is widely considered unnecessarily complex. However, if the individual enters a collaborative custody partnership with one or more institutional key agents capable of deploying SSS or MPC, this increased layer of security becomes more easily accessible. Lone individuals holding bitcoin have several reasonable options, including single-level threshold security. Multi-level thresholds are unnecessarily complex unless a collaborative partnership is involved. Custody for institutions For companies, governments and other institutions who want to secure a bitcoin treasury, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to employ some of the custody strategies used by typical individuals. If multiple people are responsible for large sums of money, more rigorous controls are necessary. Institutional-grade bitcoin custody requires threshold security as a bare minimum. Multisig, SSS, and MPC are the available choices to meet that requirement. While MPC is by far the most complicated to safely use, and wouldn\u2019t be recommended for individuals, an institution with a team of experts might consider it. However, the extra effort to set up MPC doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a superior option to basic multisig. All three models have trade offs, as discussed in our earlier article comparing them. If an institution wants the highest level of security possible, they should consider using multi-level thresholds. In this arrangement, the foundation is multisig, which allows for a threshold of multiple separate private keys in order to access funds. Several different enterprise key agents can be responsible for each key, minimizing counterparty risk from any single custodian. Additionally, each key agent can apply their own threshold security for the key they are responsible for, by using SSS or MPC. This protects the key from any single officer within the key agent firm. Institutions would be unwise to use a custody model lacking threshold security for their bitcoin treasury. There are several threshold options to choose from, and for the utmost security, they can be combined to form multi-level thresholds. Multisig has a higher security ceiling As you may have noticed from the charts above, there is a distinct difference between the upper security limits of singlesig and multisig. With singlesig, there is only a single key which can have a threshold applied to it, creating a single-level threshold. Multisig can act as a single-level threshold as well, but also travel a step further: it can be the foundation of multi-level thresholds. Therefore, sizable bitcoin holdings that utilize a singlesig foundation rather than a multisig foundation\u2014which can often be observed by examining the address type\u2014have an opportunity for a security upgrade. Multi-level thresholds can unlock a robust multi-institution custody structure that distributes risk across key agents.

Then, 25. Eventually, 12.5. After that, 6.25. And now, 3.125. Four halvings later, we enter the fifth of 33 epochs of Bitcoin. The first 32 epochs, in Bitcoin-terms, last 210,000 blocks, with the 33rd lasting until the heat death of the universe. At 10 minutes per block, on average, that means just about every four years, Bitcoin cuts its supply issuance in half. The specific numerical finite-ness that comes downstream of this mechanism \u2013\u2013 that defines bitcoin\u2019s scarcity in a nearly infinite universe \u2013\u2013 is ultimately irrelevant. Satoshi could have started at a 100 bitcoin block reward and we would have arrived at just about the same place today. But there are some statistical conveniences of starting at 50, such as that 50% of all bitcoin to ever be issued are during the first epoch. And thus, 25% of all bitcoin to ever be issued were issued in the second, and so on, and so forth. Speaking of fourth, the fourth epoch terminates in the fourth month of 2024 at the completion of the fourth halving at block 840,000. A lot happened the fourth time around: El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender, Wall Street\u2019s ETF play, the Taproot-enabling softfork, and even Ordinals. Every new halving brings up the legitimacy of cycle theory, of whether or not supply issuance can be \u201cpriced in\u201d. Each halving is a time of self-reflection for bitcoiners and the culture they curate. Not only is Bitcoin arguably no longer a counter-culture with nation-state and Wall-street adoption (co-option?), but it is no longer a mono-culture. While many things were born during this epoch, it is perhaps the death of the homogenous bitcoiner that is the most apparent. Bitcoin is for anyone; Salvadorans, Larry Fink, Bored Apes, and ESG\u2019ers. Welcome to the Fifth Epoch.

Spending countless hours in solitude, meticulously writing the code that would bring the world its first-ever successful attempt at creating a truly decentralized monetary network, the first of which our species has ever had the privilege of experiencing. The pseudonymous creator\u2019s thought process is one we can\u2019t picture - laying out Bitcoin\u2019s framework and ironing out the innovation that is the network\u2019s distributed ledger, the complex mining process that secures it. And then, one of the most fundamental, yet underappreciated, pieces of Satoshi's design was the pre-coded, fixed supply schedule with a 50% reduction in new issuance that happens quadrennially - the Bitcoin halving. Hard-coded into Bitcoin\u2019s core, this deflationary event called \u201cthe halving\u201d, which enforces the reduction in the supply of the bitcoins being introduced into circulation, is undoubtedly a crucial technical element of the protocol and was a foundational design choice. The creation of a digital currency that would maintain its scarcity and by extension its value, over the long term. A digital currency that would exist beyond the reach of central banking policies and the whims of the hands that control them. That was Satoshi\u2019s idea. And to properly execute this, it had to have a pre-programmed finite supply of 21 million units, with an engineered supply compression mechanism that gradually slows down the rate of issuance of new coins in a four-year cycle. I\u2019m not going to get into too much detail about the Bitcoin halving and its technical aspects, because a lot of brilliant minds have already talked extensively about it, so why reinvent the wheel? Rather, let\u2019s take a few steps back in time. 15 YEARS AGO Let's go back a decade and a half, back to those grueling hours Satoshi Nakamoto must have spent working on Bitcoin. Hunched over, working tirelessly on the code, integrating the halving and all it was meant to represent for the network as a mechanism that ensures the long-term scarcity of this new digital currency. Theoretically, he must have known the profound impact the halving would have on the fiat value of Bitcoin. I mean, considering basic economics and how scarcity inversely correlates with value, it couldn\u2019t have been hard to derive that conclusion. However, is it possible that he could have anticipated the significant cultural influence this pre-programmed technical process would take on? In those early days, the Bitcoin community was a tiny one, comprising merely thousands globally - a few cypherpunks here and there, coders, and a handful of libertarian idealists tinkering in home offices, basements, and dorm rooms, securing the network while earning those block rewards. Unaware, of course, of the frenzy and excitement that would one day surround each approaching halving. And yet, that obscure, humble beginning, was about to birth a cultural phenomenon unlike anything those first few miners nor even Satoshi could have envisioned. With the gradual emergence of Bitcoin into mainstream consciousness over its 15 years of existence, the 4-year hard-coded algorithmic ritual morphed from mere technicalities of a program, into a global celebration - an event that unifies Bitcoiners worldwide, no matter their creed, race, and political ideology and all other superficial ethnocultural and socio-economic classifications we have created - eagerly anticipating, planning parties, that have now come to mark the progression of this monetary revolution. FROM MACRO EVENT TO QUASI-HOLIDAY The once arcane, behind-the-scenes process of miners receiving fewer freshly minted bitcoin, blossomed into a veritable quasi-holiday for Bitcoiners and Cryptography enthusiasts. With its gradual emergence from the fringes, from the darker corners of the internet back in the days when it used to be seen as a tool for hackers, unscrupulous individuals, and bad actors, Bitcoin gained mainstream awareness, enabling the halving to take up a seemingly mystical significance. It became not just a routine supply shock in BTC issuance, but a chance for Bitcoiners around the world to unite in their shared commitment to a monetary protocol that at its foundation, possesses the core principles of decentralization, limited supply, and independence from government manipulation. As we approach the 2024 halving - depending on when you\u2019ll be reading this - it has become curiously impossible to ignore the growing cultural significance of this event. Halving countdowns have now become a recurrent element on social media. Bitcoin and Crypto news platforms, as well as mainstream media outlets and other financial news platforms, have published reports about the halving over the past few months. And then there are events and parties scheduled throughout April 2024. At these events, Bitcoiners will gather for halving-themed parties and events across the globe - from a \"Bit-Rave\" festival in San Salvador to themed happy hours in the pubs of Bedford, UK, and even a lakeside gathering in the California desert. There\u2019s even talks of a bitcoin halving festival being held in Calabar, Nigeria. It's a fair bet that there must be a bunch of other such events either already past, or scheduled to hold within the month somewhere in the world. Though admittedly not all of them are exactly \u201chalving parties\u201d, but, the fact that they are all scheduled for April when we expect the confirmation of the 840,000th block, tells all. CEMENTING SATOSHI\u2019S VISION FOR SCARCITY AND DECENTRALIZATION As we look ahead towards the 2024 halving considering what it has grown to be these past decade-plus, one question comes to mind; will this quadrennial event continue to hold such profound significance? Bitcoin\u2019s identity seems to have formed its base around the halving. It seems to have been ingrained in such a way that Bitcoin, as we know it today, will not be what it is without the event. That much is clear. It creates a reliable, as well as a predictable cadence for Bitcoiners to gather in a shared celebration of the protocol's core ethos. Each iteration reinforces the network's commitment to true digital scarcity, decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance - the very principles that drew early adopters to this monetary revolution in the first place. The very same principles on which Satoshi\u2019s vision - not the flawed BSV fork though - is based. The halving can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy - each supply squeeze is expected to drive up bitcoin\u2019s price, thereby further cementing its place as a store-of-value asset that transcends time. This \u201cprophecy\u201d has enabled analysts, traders, and institutions to develop entire frameworks around the halving\u2019s anticipated impact. Which further emphasizes the point earlier alluded to; that it is ingrained in Bitcoin\u2019s identity. This weaves it into the cultural fabric of the digital currency in a way that transcends its origins as merely a technicality. CONCLUSION As the 2024 Bitcoin halving approaches, its ever enduring significance may lie in its ability to consistently remind Bitcoiners of the network's unwavering principles. In an era marked by rapid technological shifts and widespread social upheaval, the halving's reliability and unchanging nature provides a sense of stability - a guidepost - so to speak - for this movement. The halving serves as a totem, a rallying cry that unites Bitcoiners in their commitment to this monetary revolution, regardless of the fluctuations and disruptions that are unavoidable in the world we live in today. It will remain a quadrennial occurrence that will continue to hold an honored place in Bitcoin culture, reminding us of each passing cycle of the network's unshakable principles and the unstoppable force of Satoshi's infallible creation. This event, this beacon of hope in unsettling times, represents an enduring constant, a touchstone that reinforces the immutable foundations upon which the Bitcoin network is built. As the celebrations surrounding the 2024 halving reach a fever pitch once more, we can be certain that this tradition will remain a vital part of the Bitcoin movement, serving as a guidepost for adherents weathering the storms of a rapidly changing technological, social landscape, geopolitical uncertainties, and global economic maelstrom.

As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same. With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on April 19, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn\u2019t appear to be breaking a sweat. Why\u2019s that? One of the reasons is that Marathon plans to generate alternative streams of revenue utilizing the heat emitted from its bitcoin mining rigs. \u201cBitcoin mining in and of itself does something very efficiently, which is produce heat,\u201d Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201c50% of industrial energy spend is spent to heat things, so imagine if you could capture the heat from Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin miners could get paid for that. That would subsidize their cost of electricity.\u201d During a fireside chat with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, held on April 9, 2024 in Washington, DC, Thiel shared an example of how Marathon plans to utilize the heat its miners produce. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re doing in Nebraska actually is we\u2019re starting to heat greenhouses and do shrimp farming using the heat from Bitcoin mining as a byproduct,\u201d Thiel explained to Senator Lummis. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to start seeing this as a way for people to grow proteins in areas of the disadvantaged world,\u201d he added. Utilizing the heat Marathon\u2019s miners produce is one of the ways in which Thiel is looking to change the perception of Bitcoin mining from something that\u2019s parasitic to something that\u2019s productive. This dovetails well with the fact that Marathon continues to improve its ability to use waste gas as fuel for its miners. Toward the end of 2023, Marathon launched a pilot project in which it mined bitcoin with energy derived solely with landfill methane, a gas that\u2019s 80x more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. The project was a success, according to Thiel. \u201cIt was a proof of concept that showed that you could successfully mine bitcoin using landfill methane gas,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cMining on landfills is very hard, but we were able to prove that you could do it quite successfully.\u201d Thiel expanded on these efforts in his conversation with Senator Lummis, tying together the ideas that Marathon could produce this heat it plans to use while having a positive impact on the environment. \u201cYou generate energy with that by turning it into methane and then converting that into electricity and you create heat with the electricity,\u201d he told Senator Lummis. \u201cIf you can take a waste product, turn it into energy and feed heat back into an industrial process, you do more for the environment than a lot of environmentalists want. And at the same time, your cost to mine bitcoin becomes very small because your energy cost is low.\u201d","article_summary":"In a sit down with Bitcoin Magazine just days before the Halving, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings Fred Thiel articulates his plan to capitalize on the main byproduct of mining bitcoin: heat.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-18T20:17:14Z","category":["business","marathon digital holdings","bitcoin miner","news","bitcoin mining"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"},{"article_title":"BlackRock Releases Bitcoin Education Series","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a series of educational content aimed at explaining Bitcoin, the Bitcoin halving, and its implications, along with insights into its approved spot Bitcoin ETF. \"April is packed with rare events this year, with eyes set on the upcoming bitcoin halving - a unique process that only happens every 4 years,\" said U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, Jay Jacobs. \"Tune in below to learn how this impacts bitcoin's value, and for more about investing in bitcoin ETFs.\" JUST IN: BlackRock releases educational #Bitcoin video. pic.twitter.com/CLaMtQtzDS \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 In a series of four videos, available on BlackRock's official website, the asset manager discusses the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as an investment, addressing common questions and concerns for investors looking to understand and navigate the Bitcoin landscape.

I will not refer to it as a whitepaper, those are real academic documents for adults. In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we\u2019ll have to break down the two pieces involved. The Building Blocks Rijndael\u2019s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate \u201cstaging\u201d transaction to withdraw their funds from the vault. This kicks off a timelock, during which they can at any time send their funds back to the vault or a secure cold storage wallet, and after the timelock the user can freely withdraw the funds to the destination they chose when beginning the withdrawal process. These are the only two ways bitcoin sent to the vault script can be spent. Explaining the full mechanics of how this is accomplished is essentially an article in itself, so I\u2019m going to do something I usually don\u2019t and hand waive this away as \u201cmagic.\u201d (Explained here by Andrew Poelstra) What this \u201cmagic\u201d allows you to do, by creating non-standard Schnorr signatures and with the help of OP_CAT, is to build the transaction the signature check is against on the script stack. This lets you enforce that certain parts of the transaction are exactly as defined ahead of time. It also allows you to put the output from a previous transaction on the stack in the process of building the transaction spending it, meaning you can compare outputs from the spending transaction against outputs from the previous transaction. This allows you to guarantee by comparing them that certain parts of the previous transaction\u2019s outputs match certain parts of the new outputs. I.e. the script, or an amount. So you can \u201ccarry forward\u201d parts of the old outputs into the new ones, and enforce that. Something else you can do with OP_CAT, which did not need Rijndael tinkering and experimenting with to prove, is verify merkle tree branches. Because you can CAT stack items together, and Bitcoin already supports hashing data on the stack, you can slowly build up a merkle tree root from a leaf node with the interior nodes. Hash two pieces together to get one hash, hash that with the pair hash, and so on. Eventually you get the root hash on the stack. You can then compare it with OP_EQUAL against a predefined root hash in the locking script. Unilateral Withdrawal These two building blocks are enough to facilitate a unilateral withdrawal mechanism from a group shared UTXO. A merkle root can be embedded in a transaction using OP_RETURN or another mechanism that commits to a leaf node for each user. The UTXO script can be structured so that any user with a balance can attempt to withdraw it. To do so they would provide the merkle branch committing to the amount they are entitled to, the authorization proof such as a public key to check a signature against, and construct the transaction on the stack to verify the appropriate conditions are met. Similar to Rijndael\u2019s OP_CAT vault, this withdrawal transaction would function as a staging point. User funds would be restricted by a timelock, and they would not be capable of completing the withdrawal until it expires. At any time before the timelock expires, any other user can create a fraud proof to stop the withdrawal and shove funds back into the group UTXO script. They can do this because of OP_CAT\u2019s ability to verify merkle trees. If someone has used a specific merkle branch to withdraw funds from the UTXO before, then that was included in a block somewhere. By constructing a transaction containing the SPV proof of that transaction inside an actual block, which can use OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL to verify the blockheader meets some minimum difficulty, they can prove on the stack that the merkle branch was used before. This allows duplicate withdrawals to be prevented. In addition to this, because you can use the \u201cCAT on the stack\u201d trick to ensure specific pieces of a previous transaction must be included in the next, you can guarantee that the current merkle root is carried forward into the next transaction after a successful withdrawal. You can also guarantee that change from the withdrawal goes back into the group sharing script. This guarantees that after one user withdraws their funds, the change UTXO is locked with a script that allows any remaining user to withdraw, and so on. Any user can unilaterally withdraw their funds at any time in any order, with the guarantee that the remainder of funds are still accessible to the rest of the users. The VM Part Readers should be familiar with the basic idea of BitVM. You can take an arbitrary computation and break it up into each of its constituent pieces and embed them in a large taproot tree, turning that computation into a back and forth challenge/response game. This allows you to lock bitcoin with more complicated conditions than is directly supported by bitcoin script itself. The only real shortcoming is the need to craft a massive amount of pre-signed transactions to facilitate this. The requirement to use pre-signed transactions is so that in the challenge/response dynamic, you can guarantee that coins are spent back into the large taproot tree encoding it unless an exit condition one way or the other is reached. OP_CAT and the ability to \u201ccarry forward\u201d data from previous transactions allows you to guarantee that without needing pre-signed transactions. So not only does this scheme allow any user to unilaterally exit on their own, it also allows locking conditions supported by a second layer that are not supported by Bitcoin script to actually be enforced in the withdrawal process. I.e. if some coins were encumbered by a smart contract the base layer doesn\u2019t understand, and then withdrawn from the second layer, those more complicated conditions could still be settled correctly on the base layer as the coins are withdrawn. The Missing Piece One thing that OP_CAT does not enable is updating a merkle tree root representing user balances off-chain verifiably. It can enable an already committed state to facilitate unilateral withdrawals, but that is because a whole section of the tree is actually put on-chain and verified. To update that root off-chain by definition means you are not putting the data on-chain. This represents a problem. There is no way with just CAT to efficiently verify that all changes to the merkle tree were authorized properly by the relevant users. Someone(s) has to be trusted, and by the nature of things capable of spending the UTXO however and wherever they want, to efficiently replace an old state root with a new one to represent all off-chain balance changes. A new opcode in addition to OP_CAT, such as OP_ZKVERIFY, would be needed to do this in a trustless manner. This wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world without OP_ZKVERIFY though. The entity updating the merkle root for off-chain transfers could be an n-of-n multisig, with 100% of the participants required to sign off on any root changes. This boils down to the same trust model as BitVM based pegs, where as long as a single honest participant exists, no one's funds can be stolen. It is a stark improvement over existing BitVM designs however when it comes to the withdrawal process. In BitVM pegs, users do not have a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. Peg operators must be trusted to fulfill user withdrawals, knowing that they can claim back funds they have spent doing so relatively trustlessly from the BitVM peg. While the incentives of this are very solid, it still does require users essentially getting permission from someone else to exit the system, they cannot do it on their own. With CatVM, users can claim back their funds unilaterally, and an operator is not required to front their own liquidity to process withdrawals. Wrapping Up Overall, the design is incomplete in terms of construction. This is not something I would call a Layer 2 in and of itself. It is the core of one, the mechanism and structure for how funds are locked into a Layer 2, and the process for how users can withdraw their funds. It definitely has a lot of flexibility and usefulness to it. In the worst case scenario, users do not need anyone\u2019s permission to safely claim their funds back on-chain. It also allows more flexible programmability of funds, while still carrying the enforcement of those conditions to the base layer in the event of worst case unilateral exits. If one day we do eventually get something like OP_ZKVERIFY, the off-chain state progression can become an actually trustless process. I don\u2019t expect any concrete demos in the near future, but it definitely is a sound idea in my opinion, and something worth considering. It also shows that the wizards are doing a little more than just pumping stupid jpegs.","article_summary":"A breakdown of Taproot Wizard's recent CatVM proposal, what it actually is, and what it could be useful for.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-the-heck-is-catvm","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T22:30:00Z","category":["op_cat","opinion","catvm","technical"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-the-heck-is-catvm","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Breaking Down The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Implications and Predictions for Bitcoin Miners","author":"El Sultan Bitcoin","article_detailed_content":"The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal occurrence, is scheduled for April, 19 2024. This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining. Economic Outlook and Market Predictions After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network. Luxor\u2019s Hashrate Index Research Team projects about 3-7% of Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate could go offline if Bitcoin\u2019s price maintains its current level. However, if prices fall, up to 16% of the hashrate could become economically unviable, depending on the trajectory of Bitcoin prices and transaction fees post-halving. The hashrate, a critical security measure for Bitcoin, might adjust along with difficulty levels to align with the new economic realities. Luxor\u2019s analysis suggests different scenarios where the network's hashrate could end up ranging from 639 EH/s to 674 EH/s by year's end, reflecting adjustments to the new earning potential post-halving. ASIC Pricing and Breakeven Points Post-halving, the profitability of different ASIC models will become crucial as the mining reward drops. Lower rewards mean that only the most efficient machines will be able to operate profitably if the price of Bitcoin does not see a significant increase. For instance, according to Luxor\u2019s projections, next-generation ASICs like the S19 XP and M30S++ might have breakeven power costs ranging from $0.07/kWh to $0.15/kWh, depending on post-Halving hashprice. This shift in profitability will likely lead to a repricing of ASIC machines. Historical data suggests that ASIC prices are highly correlated with hashprice; therefore, the anticipated reduction in hashprice will prompt a downward adjustment in ASIC values. This will particularly impact older and less efficient models, potentially accelerating their phase-out from the market. The Role of Custom ASIC Firmware Post-Halving To combat reduced profitability, miners are increasingly turning to custom ASIC firmware to improve the efficiency of their hardware. Firmware like LuxOS and BraiinsOS can enhance the performance of machines by optimizing their power usage and hashrate output, thus lowering the breakeven point for electricity costs. For example, underclocking an S19 with custom firmware could extend its operational viability by reducing its power draw, thereby maintaining profitability even at lower hashprices. Public miners, in particular, are adopting custom firmware to boost the efficiency of their fleets. Companies like CleanSpark and Marathon have reported using custom solutions to enhance their operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to grow as more miners seek to maximize their output and minimize costs in the face of decreasing block rewards. 2024 Bitcoin Halving and Beyond The 2024 Bitcoin Halving is set to reshape the mining landscape significantly, just as previous halvings have. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, the event will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities. Miners who plan strategically, taking into account both economic forecasts and operational efficiencies, will be better positioned to navigate the post-halving environment. For those in the Bitcoin mining industry, staying informed and adaptable will be key to leveraging the halving event as an opportunity rather than a setback. With the right preparations, particularly in ASIC management and firmware optimization, miners can continue to thrive even under tightened economic conditions.

NEW: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs to start trading by 30th April and could bring in $25 billion: Reports Just a matter of time 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Y1Xo4JVrO7 \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently approved several fund managers to offer spot bitcoin ETFs. Following this, OSL, a crypto infrastructure provider for some approved fund managers, stated that the bitcoin ETFs are aiming to go live as early as late April. Markus Thielen, founder of research firm 10x, also stated that the Bitcoin ETFs could start trading by April 30th. The launch timeline will depend on finalizing details with regulators. Once listed, analysts predict the accessible funds could attract significant capital inflows. Singapore-based Matrixport expects mainland Chinese investors to pour up to $25 billion into Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETFs via the Southbound Stock Connect program. Thielen echoed this sentiment, stating the ETFs could yield $25 billion if fully accessible to Chinese investors. However, he noted that Chinese participation may take at least six months due to evolving regulations. Nonetheless, the ETFs mark a milestone for Bitcoin adoption in Asia. They provide regulated exposure to bitcoin, opening the assets to a broader range of investors. The funds' unique in-kind redemption feature also makes them competitive globally. This allows swapping bitcoin directly for ETF shares, increasing efficiency. Click the image to learn more. By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub. The city is moving swiftly to license Bitcoin companies and products amid growing demand. With bitcoin's next halving just days away, the ETF launch timing is opportune. Many predict the supply shock event will propel Bitcoin to new highs, benefiting linked investment vehicles. If successful, Hong Kong's spot ETFs could prompt other Asian jurisdictions to follow suit. The domino effect would boost regional participation and maturity for the Bitcoin market.","article_summary":"Hong Kong's hotly anticipated spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to launch by end of April, potentially yielding up to $25 billion in capital inflows according to industry analysts.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-to-trade-by-april-30th-reports","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T21:48:34Z","category":["china","business","news","spot bitcoin etf","hong kong"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-to-trade-by-april-30th-reports","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU1NjA5NTEzNjY3/hong-kong-securities-regulator-promises-to-regulate-crypto-investment-funds.jpg"},{"article_title":"Rights, Reason, Revolution: In DC at the Bitcoin Policy Summit","author":"Stephen Pollock","article_detailed_content":"In the whirlwind of April 2024, with Bitcoin ETFs dominating headlines and halving celebration planning in full swing, the Bitcoin Policy Summit emerged as a pivotal moment for policymakers, industry leaders, and human rights champions. Against the backdrop of global discussions on Bitcoin regulation\u2014and coinciding with a solar eclipse\u2014the summit aimed to be a beacon of reason and a catalyst for action in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. The Bitcoin Policy Summit boasted a remarkable turnout, with more than 45,000 individuals tuning into the livestream. Among the 500+ in-person attendees were representatives from 26 universities, 75 government officials, and 250 public policy professionals. The summit also garnered attention from over a dozen media outlets. Notably, elected leaders from both major political parties were present, alongside representatives from prominent organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Department, Department of Commerce, Treasury Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The summit, with its diverse mix of voices and perspectives, shed light on the pressing need for smart and informed decision-making in the realm of digital asset policy. While Bitcoin symbolizes financial freedom and empowerment, it also brings its fair share of challenges, from concerns about money laundering to energy usage. The summit tackled these complex issues head-on, offering insights into the multifaceted world of Bitcoin as it relates to mining, geopolitics, the future of money, and human rights. The Bitcoin Policy Summit witnessed a significant turnout of policymakers committed to safeguarding the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and addressing its associated challenges. Figures such as Senators Marsha Blackburn, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cynthia Lummis, alongside House members Wiley Nickel, Tom Emmer, and Patrick McHenry, lent their expertise and bipartisan support to the discussions. Their active involvement not only enriched the conversation but also signaled a united effort to ensure that digital asset policies foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold transparency and accountability. One of the most striking features of the summit was its focus on the intersection of Bitcoin and human rights, with speakers like Felix Maradiaga, 2024 Nobel Prize Nominee and prominent human rights advocate from Nicaragua; Anna Chekhovich, financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) founded by Alexei Navalny; Roya Mahboob, Afghan entrepreneur and women's rights advocate; and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian human rights activist. Their combined emphasis on Bitcoin\u2019s critical role in defending human rights and freedom of expression in the face of dictators and oppressive regimes shed light on broader roles for digital assets that many in the United States may not have previously considered. Furthermore, the summit stressed the importance of taking a global perspective on digital asset regulation to protect human rights. In a world where digital assets know no borders, fragmented regulatory approaches risk creating loopholes and undermining financial integrity. Human rights activists stressed the need to protect privacy, free speech, and equal access to financial services for all, regardless of where they are. The conference hall buzzed with anticipation as attendees dispersed into three specialized rooms for afternoon deep dive tracks: Mining & Energy, Geopolitics, and Future of Money. Concurrent programming featured keynotes such as \u201cA Climate Scientist\u2019s Perspective on Bitcoin\u201d by Margot Paez, BPI fellow and PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. Fireside chats and panels included \"Bitcoin & Financial Inclusion\" with Chastity Murphy from the U.S. Treasury, and \"Countering Digital Authoritarianism\" featuring renowned writer Roger Huang, author of \u2018Bitcoin and China\u2019, and Jorge Jrsaissati, President of the Organization for Economic Inclusion. One of my personal highlights from the Bitcoin Policy Summit was engaging in a fireside chat with Senator Marsha Blackburn from my home state of Tennessee. We explored the connection between Bitcoin and her advocacy for consumer rights and privacy. Additionally, we discussed Tennessee's growing prominence as a Bitcoin hub and her stance on CBDCs (spoiler: she\u2019s not a fan). It's truly inspiring to witness elected leaders championing both monetary and digital freedoms, reinforcing their commitment to safeguarding these fundamental rights. Another standout moment occurred during a post-summit dinner with Felix Maradiaga and his wife, Berta Valle. Felix, who endured four years of imprisonment under a Nicaraguan dictator, shared firsthand accounts of political dissent and activism. These experiences underscore the importance of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network, providing resilience against oppression. The 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington D.C. served as a crucial platform for educating policymakers and advocating for Bitcoin's role in shaping a freer and more sustainable financial future. Through candid dialogue, diverse perspectives, and collaborative efforts across sectors, participants witnessed the transformative potential of Bitcoin to advance global human rights, bolster national security, and accelerate renewable energy adoption. As we reflect on the insights garnered from the summit, let's seize this pivotal moment to shape a regulatory landscape that not only fosters innovation and economic growth but also champions human dignity, justice, and liberty.

Bitcoin tumbled below $60,000 over the weekend, fueled by conflict between Iran and Israel, sparking fears that escalation could lead to Western involvement in a war in the Middle East\u2014an all too common occurrence in the 21st century that would lead to increased inflationary pressures and disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets. While skeptics were quick to mock bitcoin\u2019s near instantaneous selloff in reaction to the news of conflict, ironically bitcoin was one of the only global asset open for trading on the weekend, with equities, commodities, and bond strategists alike turning their eyes to the bitcoin chart in an attempt to assess what the damage might be to global markets upon the Sunday night trading open. Turning away from geopolitics, this brief article will take a look at the latest in on-chain spending behavior and Bitcoin derivative markets, to analyze whether the current dip from the highs of $73,000 is typical of a standard bull market correction or more so a cyclical peak. Many preconceived notions of a typical Bitcoin cycle have already been shattered with new highs being broken before the upcoming halving taking place on block 840,000. So let's evaluate and take a look at where we are, and how these conditions and investor behavior also inform what might come next. We\u2019ll be looking at both on-chain data, to analyze the actions of incumbent Bitcoin hodlers and new market entrants alike, before taking a look at the derivatives market to gauge whether there is anything worrisome in regards to the leverage currently present in the market. Unchained is the Official Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine. Click here to learn more about Unchained's bitcoin financial services and receive exclusive discounts on Unchained vault, Signature and IRA. First, we\u2019ll take a look at a metric called the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, coined and created by TXMC, which compares near-term spending behavior to the yearly average, as a means of detecting overheated and undervalued markets. A brief look at this signals that the bull market is well underway, and may have even peaked. The exact calculation of the metric, for those curious, is the ratio of two daily moving averages (30, 365) of Value Days Destroyed (Coin Days Destroyed * Price), then adjusted for supply inflation to account for changes in spender behavior over time. We can attribute approximately one third of the spending as a simple transfer of coins from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to new ETF participants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. However, the raw data is just that\u2014the raw data, and we can see there has been a significant amount of spending that\u2019s occurred with the push to new highs. A closer look at the metric, however, shows that this spending activity is cooling off, and there is historical precedent for new highs in the market in both the 2017 and 2021 cycle - this is merely a data point to keep in mind. Next, taking a look at the interplay between HODLers and new entrants, viewed through the lens of short-term and long-term holders, we can see that during a typical bull market, revisits to the cost basis of short-term holders are not only typical but also quite healthy. Additionally, the ability for this approximate price level to serve as support is a characteristic of bull markets, with the inverse being true in a bear market, where this psychological level of average short-term holder price (cost basis) often serves as ironclad psychological and technical resistance. As for where that level is today, approximately $58,500, which means that by no means is a visit to this level a guarantee or certainty, but rather it is something that is perfectly in the norm of expected activity in a bull market. Turning our attention to the derivatives market, there has been a healthy flush of leverage and speculative froth across the market. Perpetual futures open in bitcoin terms are near the lowest levels seen since 2022, while futures have been trading at a slight discount to spot markets since the weekend flush lower. While there is no law or guarantee that this brings about higher prices immediately, similar positioning in the past has fostered the conditions for price appreciation, and when compared to the top-heavy speculative froth of a speculative premium in futures market pricing observed over the last month or so, it is a welcomed development. In terms of points of interest when eyeing the derivatives landscape, the buildup of liquidatable leverage above $70,000 continues to grow, with emboldened shorts looking to push price meaningfully below $60,000. While there is some leverage to be purged under the $60,000 level, the real prize for bears is under the $50,000 level. While certainly crazier things have happened in Bitcoin than a -33% pullback from all-time highs, spot demand is likely to be strong from $50,000, and a wipe of open interest and the start of a negative futures premium relative to spot markets hint at most of the pullback having already taken place. It would likely take a significant risk-off moment across the macro landscape for this to unfold, and any dip is likely to be fleeting given the perpetuating reality of the pace of fiscal deficit spending. Conclusion: This bull market has legs, and the current pullback from the highs, along with any future dips in the exchange rate, should be a welcomed development for investors with a sufficiently long time horizon who understand where this is all headed. Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals continue to improve, and pullbacks serve to purge leverage and weak handed speculators during secular bull markets. BTFD.

Private When Alexander \u201cAkin\u201d Fernandez first conceptualized Azteco over a decade ago, he simply wanted to make bitcoin easier to obtain. He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute. Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you don\u2019t have to disclose your identity to do so, not to mention the process of buying a voucher is quick and easy. Azteco offers both on-chain and Lightning capabilities, giving users the choice to redeem their BTC on either the Bitcoin base chain or the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payments network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. According to an estimate from Fernandez, over one million people have already purchased Azteco vouchers. But his aspirations are far beyond the already-impressive number of vouchers thus sold: he has his sights set on Azteco servicing a customer base of over 30 times that, as Azteco does its part in \u201cnormalizing\u201d Bitcoin. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: Where did the inspiration for Azteco come from? Akin Fernandez: It came from my own experience of finding out that getting bitcoin is very difficult. I realized it doesn't have to be like this. We could use a familiar system like a top-up voucher, which billions of people use to top up their mobile phones, and apply that process to getting bitcoin. All we have to do is build a software, put distribution in place, and then it should just work. And lo and behold, it does. Corva: Did you have a particular customer base in mind when you designed Azteco? Fernandez: Yes, I had myself in mind. I wanted to be able to get bitcoin without having to make any kind of fuss or effort to do it. I wanted to be able to go to the supermarket, buy $20 worth of bitcoin and put it straight onto my wallet. And I'm not unique. I could assume that there were other people who were like me who could understand the proposition and the ease of use and who would take to it like a duck to water. You find that with inventions, many times they come about because people are solving problems for themselves, not as a means to get rich or for any reason other than to solve their own problems. And because people are similar, they solve other people's problems, too. Corva: Speaking of your own experience. I\u2019ve read that you were unbanked for a period of time. Is this true and could you expand on it, if so? Fernandez: Well, I became unbanked for a reason that I, until this day, don't know. I went down to \u201cmy\u201d bank to cash a check, and they couldn't find my account in the system. I had received no communication from them in writing or in any way. All of a sudden, I had no bank account. So, for many years after that I didn't have access to credit cards or anything that other people in the West take for granted. This taught me a very, very big lesson about how difficult it is to do anything in the 21st century if you don't have access to banking facilities. You can forget shopping online. You can forget any kind of convenience of going into a store and paying with a card. All of that goes away. So, when I was working on Azteco, it was made clear to me how powerful a tool it was going to be, because, with Bitcoin, you cannot be unbanked by any third party. You have control over your synthetic money. Corva: I\u2019ve heard you use this term \u201csynthetic money\u201d before, and you\u2019ve discussed how we shouldn\u2019t refer to bitcoin as actual money. Why is it important that we do this? Fernandez: It's important because it's true. Bitcoin is not money \u2014 it's a database. Can it be used as money? Of course. It can be used as very, very good money. It's a good simulation of money. But it doesn't have to be money for it to be useful. Also, if you call bitcoin money, all the regulations that the state has imposed on actual money can be superimposed or brushed over Bitcoin inappropriately, making it hard to use and slower to spread. So, it's very important to tell the truth about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has taken so long to get into every nook and cranny because there's been this misconstruing of it as money. WhatsApp reached a billion people in four and a half years. That's the kind of spread into people's phones that we'd expect if the rails to get onto Bitcoin were frictionless, just like they are with WhatsApp. The fact that Bitcoin has not reached that number of people indicates that there's something wrong in the way people are thinking about it, and so it's important for us to think about it correctly. Corva: How many people is Azteco reaching? Put another way, how many vouchers did Azteco sell in Q3 or Q4 of 2023? Fernandez: The actual numbers I don't have at hand being the CEO and not the CFO. But we had our biggest ever month last month. I was told this yesterday. The number of vouchers we're selling is increasing, and this is a direct result of our increasing our distribution and also the sentiment towards Bitcoin changing on a global scale. We're the easiest way to get bitcoin. When people discover us, they say two things: \u201cFirst of all, why isn't everything as easy as this?\u201d and \u201cHow come I haven't heard of this before?\u201d Things are synergizing and coming together to bring us to a point where we're a global force for good and for getting Bitcoin to the people who need it the most \u2014 the unbanked and the people who don't have access to financial rails or people who just don't want to be the victims of the financial rails. The old school crop of Bitcoin businesses that have been serving people over the last 10 years all believe that Bitcoin is money and make it very difficult to get an account. Everybody's so inured to the idea of having a bank account or an account of any kind, whether it's through email or anything else. The assumption immediately is, \u201cWell, of course, I have to have an account in order to use this service.\u201d With Bitcoin, that's not true, though. No accounts are necessary. [Some] wallet companies are doing this correctly. One of them is Samourai Wallet and another is Wallet of Satoshi where you don\u2019t need to open an account to use your own money. They\u2019re saying you shouldn\u2019t be able to use bitcoin without having an account. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do in the EU. Corva: We\u2019re doing it here in the US with the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA), too, the bill that Elizabeth Warren drafted. Fernandez: These people are oath breakers. They\u2019ve sworn an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution, which guarantees the free speech of every single American. Bitcoin is speech. It's a database where speech is written down and stored and transmitted from one person to another. And lest anyone think that I'm picking on the Democrats and not the Republicans, Cynthia Lummis has written an absolutely appalling bill that I took great pleasure in tearing to pieces on my blog. They don\u2019t understand what their role is as a public servant. A servant is not in control of its masters. A servant is obedient to the electorate. It\u2019s not their business to tell people you have to KYC to use bitcoin. Corva: On the topic of America and KYC-free bitcoin, do you see people using Azteco because they want KYC-free bitcoin? Fernandez: In order for the American market to be cracked, the service has to be explained. People have to be deprogrammed. They don\u2019t understand that bitcoin is not a vehicle to make you earn more fiat. People need to be broken out of these bad habits to be shown that actually there are better ways to get things done. The perfect example of this is WhatsApp. Before WhatsApp, people used to pay for SMS messages, while the idea of this is now unthinkable. A similar process has to happen with Bitcoin where you can send money to family members without having to go through a third party or pay exorbitant fees or identify yourself or anything like that. With Bitcoin, you [also] get other subtle benefits. Hyperinflation is starting to kick in and people are starting to realize that there\u2019s something wrong with the money. People find it very difficult to go to the root cause of the prices going up at McDonalds. Let\u2019s say they did find out the cause, what could they do about it? They could go and get bitcoin, but it\u2019s several steps down before these people are going to see bitcoin as the answer. Corva: I agree. Fernandez: Also, the current crop of businesses \u2014 big businesses like Binance, Coinbase \u2014 are synonymous with bitcoin. Azteco needs to be synonymous with getting bitcoin. The vast majority of people on earth are not rich. They don't have $100,000 to spend on bitcoin. They live day to day. Since these people are not investors and they don't have spare money to keep in bitcoin in the hopes that it's going to go up \u2014 which of course it will \u2014 they need to have bitcoin as daily money for everyday spending. Once you start talking about these things, the business opportunities and models start to just fall out of the conversation. All of these Cynthia Lummises and Elizabeth Warrens prevent these business models from emerging because they're regulating something they have no business regulating. Corva: Speaking of other businesses, I\u2019ve heard you say good things about Machankura, a protocol that makes it easier for Africans to use bitcoin in a KYC manner, and that it serves as a compliment to Azteco. What other companies in the Bitcoin space are a compliment to Azteco? Fernandez: Ethical Bitcoin wallets are a good compliment. By ethical, I mean Samourai Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi. I know that some people don\u2019t like Wallet of Satoshi because the architecture on the backend is not to their liking, but these people don\u2019t run businesses \u2014 they don\u2019t know how difficult it is to do these things. The newest entrant to this is the Bitkey wallet. This Bitkey wallet is absolutely unbelievable. They've thought about this properly. The user interface and user experience \u2014 it's going to make everybody change their game. I've been saying for a long time that somebody like Apple, Microsoft or some other company is going to get into Bitcoin and bring all of that user experience thinking to the process of using Bitcoin. The current crop of companies have not thought about user experience. Jack Dorsey\u2019s Bitkey has been a kick in the backside to a lot of people who realize that we can't just carry on doing what we want to do and expecting people to just accept it \u2014 the idea that you have to write down your mnemonic before you receive your first transaction. It\u2019s completely crazy. If Apple developed its own Bitcoin wallet or clones one of the Bitcoin wallets out there, Bitcoin is going to be exposed to people in a way that's very easy to understand, very easy to consume. There will be the new generation of Bitcoin users for whom Bitcoin is totally normal \u2014 not threatening, intimidating or frightening. Corva: The same way that using WhatsApp or Uber is normal now\u2026 Fernandez: That's exactly right. Bitcoin has to become boring.","article_summary":"Alexander \u201cAkin\u201d Fernandez\u2019s Azteco provides Bitcoin users around the world a way to get their hands on \u201csynthetic money\u201d without revealing their identity, creating a world in which bitcoin is so ubiquitous and easy to use that it\u2019s boring.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/azteco-is-helping-millions-buy-bitcoin-without-sharing-their-identity","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T02:40:48Z","category":["bitcoin","lightning","azteco","founders","business"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/azteco-is-helping-millions-buy-bitcoin-without-sharing-their-identity","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"},{"article_title":"The Weekly Reorg: Bitcoin Fashion Week","author":"Alex Bergeron","article_detailed_content":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.

Similarly, this new crop of Bitcoin-adjacent protocol seems content launching with either no product or \u201cdecentralization on the roadmap.\u201d Under the layers of vapid marketing and technical mumbo jumbo, it\u2019s hard to find a trust model that is much better than the simple and often maligned Liquid federated sidechain. Forget unilateral exit, most of the \u201cLayer 2s\u201d on offer today can hardly qualify for the term under our admittedly loose policy here at Bitcoin Magazine. To make matters worse, variants of proof-of-stake have crept into the design space despite Ethereum\u2019s abysmal performance since its transition. Not surprisingly, the conversation has already devolved into ponzinomics to bootstrap the speculative flywheel. Colloquially styled \u201cpoints,\u201d a new token contraption has burst onto the scene and is all the rage amongst the designer crowd. This new liquidity farming fad requires users to deposit their bitcoins (and those of friends and family) somewhere in exchange for, you guessed it, yield. They\u2019re calling it gamification this time around. I think it\u2019s peak crypto nihilism. Fast fashion has officially made it into Bitcoin! The Emperor Has No Clothes? Speaking of catwalks and clownishly dressed individuals, the crew at Taproot Wizards recently unleashed pandemonium on the aspiring Layer 2 community by going at its most prized science project, BitVM. My esteemed colleague Shinobi put together a decent recap of the event. I wont bother you with the technical details but, of course, the claims remain hotly contested to this day. At least a dozen new companies\u2019 fate hangs in the balance here so you can imagine the smell when they were publicly outed to the fashion police. Although I\u2019m partial to the wizards\u2019 arguments, we should probably hold off on writing the obituary for BitVM. Jumping through liquidity hoops appears to be one of the pervasive tradeoffs one has to make when designing trust-minimized protocols on top of Bitcoin. Lightning has given us inbound liquidity headaches for years. Proposals like Ark have been dismissed because of the massive UTXOs operators have to fund. Maybe BitVM bridges can be designed to mitigate the upfront liquidity requirements of operators. At least, the issue is probably not enough for everyone to drop everything and go home. The unfortunate takeaway from this saga is that everyone involved comes away looking a bit amateurish. Despite claims to the contrary, some due diligence was clearly skipped. The issue could\u2019ve been run through a bit more collective brain cells before publishing and you can tell the targets all felt pretty blindsided by the announcement. To tie this all up, the wizards have just come out with their derivative proposal. It\u2019s hard not to get the impression that this was a bit of a setup motivated by marketing purposes. Then again, they\u2019re grown men wearing wizard hats, what do you expect? On the other hand, it is a valid issue and the response from \u201cteam\u201d BitVM hasn\u2019t been exactly gracious either. You\u2019d expect thicker skin from researchers who have been around the block. Banning people from a Telegram working group and hand-waving away the entire premise does not serve the interest of the community they are building for. They can disagree with the conclusions but the obvious outcome is that the audience and interest in BitVM have now grown beyond the small engineering circles where it was fomenting. Many have suggested it was probably the first time the mechanism was communicated in an accessible way. It was a missed opportunity for its advocates to leverage this attention and steer it their way if they thought the project was misrepresented. Hopefully, this is all just a failed dress rehearsal because I don\u2019t see how this is very inspiring for anyone seriously interested in contributing to this space. A grand finale Of course, a circus show isn\u2019t complete without the clown act. The hottest protocol designer in town is preparing to showcase his latest line just in time for the halving this Friday. Runes, a protocol for fungible tokens, is probably the most anticipated drop since the Jordan 1s. As we speak, hundreds of users are syncing up Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives in preparation for the festivities. The blockchain is expecting a record crowd for this event so be advised that tickets could get expensive. As for myself, I\u2019ll probably just watch from my balcony in the comfort of my safe and ever-reliable Bitcoin jeans. Tick tock, next block.","article_summary":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-17T02:13:55Z","category":["technical","culture","layer 2"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin DevCon To Take Place Alongside Bitcoin Asia  ","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","article_detailed_content":"In addition to showcasing the world\u2019s most important Bitcoin companies and leaders of today, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for the next generation of Bitcoin startups to meet, build, and get in front of the community.

However, while we\u2019re all keenly aware of BTC\u2019s impact on financial markets (a more or less permanent fixture of the news cycle), we often forget to take a step back and look at how this new frontier affects real change and real people. For those historically marginalized by traditional banking due to barriers like poor credit or lack of accessibility, BTC has emerged as a vital financial tool. Its impact is most profound in developing countries, where access to banking still poses a challenge for many. Here, Bitcoin serves as more than a currency or an investment; it's a means to engage in essential financial activities, such as sending and receiving money, that would otherwise be out of reach. Forget, at least for a minute, the speculative potential in terms of financial gain\u2014the true value of Bitcoin lies in its potential to level the financial playing field, offering access to financial tools that were previously exclusive to those with more established economic backgrounds. Amid its fluctuating value, the enduring promise of Bitcoin is its contribution to financial inclusivity, making it a beacon of hope for more equitable access to financial services worldwide. Historical context of Bitcoin and financial inclusivity Bitcoin was born out of the financial turmoil of the late 2000s, with its creator(s) aiming to forge a decentralized currency that could bypass traditional banking systems and help society at large traverse a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. This vision was not just technical but deeply ideological, seeking to empower individuals with financial autonomy. At its core, Bitcoin promised to make financial services accessible to anyone with internet access, regardless of their standing with conventional financial institutions. This promise has seen tangible realization in countries like Nigeria, where traditional banking services are out of reach for many. In Nigeria, Bitcoin has become more than a speculative asset\u2014for instance, with the country's significant diaspora, Bitcoin facilitates remittances, enabling Nigerians living abroad to send money home more efficiently and at lower costs compared to traditional banking services. In Argentina, Bitcoin has emerged as a crucial financial tool amidst the country's ongoing economic challenges, including high inflation rates and currency devaluation. For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers a more stable store of value compared to the national currency, the Argentine peso, which has suffered from significant depreciation over the years. A similar trend can be noticed in Ghana, where the annual inflation rate is predicted to land in the 13% to 17% range in 2024. In Venezuela, a country grappling with political instability and economic crises, Bitcoin has found a unique role beyond just a means of preserving wealth against hyperinflation. Here, Bitcoin is being utilized to support microfinance initiatives and charitable donations, directly impacting the lives of those in need. Organizations and platforms leveraging cryptocurrency can bypass traditional financial systems, which are often inaccessible or unreliable for the country's impoverished populations, to provide direct financial assistance. Moreover, for entrepreneurs and small business owners the world over, it offers a means to engage in international transactions without the need for bank accounts or the risk of currency devaluation. It\u2019s both a hedge against crisis and a vessel of freedom against authoritarian regimes, but the decentralization schtick isn\u2019t The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing the digital currency, BTC ETFs offer a familiar, regulated avenue for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin space. Previously, the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin deterred many institutional investors. However, with the advent of ETFs and other regulated investment products, these entities can now participate in the cryptocurrency market, bringing with them substantial capital inflows and increased legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, which will only increase with further adoption. This institutional foray into Bitcoin has a dual impact. On one hand, it introduces a level of stability and liquidity previously unseen, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. On the other, it represents a shift from Bitcoin's original ethos of decentralization and democratization of finance. Another point to consider is that institutional interest isn\u2019t limited to private, for-profit enterprises\u2014with countries like El Salvador, which recently took custody of its national Bitcoin treasury showcasing that, slowly but surely, the general attitude of governments towards cryptocurrencies is also changing with the times. Potential impacts of institutionalization on accessibility On the one hand, these developments can enhance Bitcoin's appeal by contributing to market stability and reducing volatility\u2014a key concern that has deterred a broader demographic from embracing cryptocurrencies. The entry of institutional investors can also increase liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially making it a more reliable asset for individuals and businesses worldwide. However, the flip side of institutionalization is the potential increase in barriers to entry for marginalized groups. The very essence of Bitcoin's appeal to these groups is its accessibility: the ability to participate in the financial system with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection. As regulatory frameworks become more stringent and the market more institutionalized, the processes for acquiring and using Bitcoin could become more complex. Requirements such as rigorous identity verification and compliance with financial regulations, while necessary for fraud prevention and financial security, could inadvertently sideline those without formal identification or those living in regions with less regulatory clarity. Moreover, the shift towards institutionalization might lead to a concentration of wealth and power within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reminiscent of traditional financial systems. This concentration could undermine the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, making it less about empowering the individual and more about serving institutional interests. The challenge lies in finding a balance: leveraging institutional interest to bring stability and legitimacy to Bitcoin while ensuring that its revolutionary promise of financial inclusivity remains intact. Financial inclusion and cryptocurrency adoption Sub-Saharan Africa, with its blend of limited banking infrastructure and high mobile penetration, has emerged as a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. The region, marked by its smaller overall market size in terms of traditional financial metrics, shows a significantly high level of grassroots cryptocurrency usage. Nigeria, for example, not only ranks second on the Global Crypto Adoption Index but also leads Sub-Saharan Africa in raw transaction volume, as well as the world in P2P exchange trade volume ranking. Other countries like Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa also feature prominently on the index, underlining the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial instruments The adoption is driven largely by practical necessities rather than speculative interests, with cryptocurrencies serving as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. In Ghana, where inflation surged to its highest level in two decades at the tail end of 2022, and in other nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa facing similar economic challenges, cryptocurrencies have become an attractive means of preserving wealth. The shift towards digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, and more recently, stablecoins, reflects a broader search for financial stability and freedom Peer-to-peer transactions, especially prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa, account for a significant portion of crypto transactions, underscoring the region's unique position in the global crypto landscape. This high rate of P2P transactions is attributed to the everyday use of crypto for retail payments, remittances, and commercial transactions. The preference for crypto over traditional banking and financial services is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity in regions where local currencies are losing value, as seen in countries like Nigeria and Kenya Through bypassing traditional financial barriers, cryptocurrencies offer expanded finance options to underserved markets, exemplified by initiatives like Empowa and Pezesha in Mozambique and Kenya that utilize blockchain to facilitate real estate development and connect MSMEs with global lenders. Balancing institutional interest and financial inclusivity As Bitcoin continues to navigate the waters between grassroots empowerment and institutional adoption, its future landscape presents a dichotomy. On one side, increased institutional interest brings stability and credibility, potentially making Bitcoin a more viable and trusted financial asset globally. On the other, this shift could challenge the very inclusivity that has been a cornerstone of Bitcoin's appeal, particularly among minority groups and in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. To ensure that Bitcoin remains a tool for empowerment, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential pathway is the development of regulatory frameworks that encourage inclusivity. Regulations could be designed to protect consumers without stifling innovation or access to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the continued support and promotion of peer-to-peer platforms can empower individuals by facilitating direct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Conclusion As Bitcoin evolves amidst rising institutional interest, its foundational role as an agent of financial inclusivity faces both challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that Bitcoin continues to serve marginalized communities requires a delicate balance, blending the stability brought by institutional involvement with its potential as a democratizing force. One thing is certain\u2014the future of Bitcoin hinges in large part on maintaining its essence as a lifeline for financial empowerment across the globe. This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

This event will bring together prominent voices in the Bitcoin space including Barstool CEO Dave Portnoy, Strike CEO Jack Mallers, Bitcoin Magazine Institutional Lead Dylan LeClair, and Ten31 Managing Partner Matt Odell. This halving event \u2013 projected to occur between April 19, 2024 \u2013 will occur as Bitcoin reaches block 840,000, marking the point at which its relative supply issuance will drop below that of gold for the first time. Previous halvings have historically acted as a turning point in the market as the reduction in newly issued coins has been met with surging demand for the currency throughout each prior halving cycle. This time around, the halving has been preceded by a new all-time high, an occurrence that has never happened since Bitcoin\u2019s inception in January 2009. Between the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (arguably the most successful ETF debut in history) by major financial institutions, and a potential resurgence in inflation, the Bitcoin bulls are on parade driving the market higher into uncharted territory. Other guests slated to appear on the livestream are Bitcoin Magazine Chief Content Officer Pete Rizzo, Human Rights Foundation Director of Financial Freedom Christian Keroles, Simply Bitcoin Founder Nico Moran, Bitcoin Magazine Correspondent Isabella Santos, and Pomp Investments Founder Anthony Pompliano. Click here for more information on the Bitcoin Halving Livestream powered by Kraken In the countdown to Bitcoin\u2019s fourth epoch, Livestream guests will review the Top 21 Moments of the past four years, as voted on by Bitcoin Magazine readers. Top moments include the rise of the Laser Eyes meme, MicroStrategy unveiling of its bitcoin-based treasury strategy, and the notorious rise and fall of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. In partnership with Nitrobetting, Bitcoin Magazine will be awarding a 1 BTC prize pool for the Bitcoin Halving Challenge to contestants who most closely predict the price of the currency at Block 840,000. Viewers will be able to count down to the halving with some of the biggest names in the space and commemorate the growth of Bitcoin with a New Year\u2019s Eve-style celebration with Bitcoiners from around the world.

For as long as humans have been organizing into social groups, we\u2019ve been hating on the group in the next valley. Even though we have much more in common with them than we would care to admit. It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. These differences aren\u2019t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can\u2019t even recall why they disliked one another in the first place. But it wasn\u2019t always that way: and it doesn\u2019t have to stay this way. There are signs that the rivalry that has polarized bitcoiners and ethereans is starting to thaw. If these frenemies can bury the hatchet and work together, it will make web3 a better place for everyone. From Divergence to Convergence It\u2019s easy to forget that Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin cut his teeth at Bitcoin Magazine and was a regular poster on the Bitcointalk forum. When the Ethereum ICO was held in 2014, funds were raised at a ratio of 2,000 ETH per BTC. It\u2019s also easy to forget that many of the use cases now synonymous with Ethereum have Bitcoin ancestors, such as NFT precursor Colored Coins. Even the concept of a Layer 2 has Bitcoin beginnings. But all that\u2019s ancient history now. BTC has assumed the mantle of store of value and global reserve currency, while ETH has become the fuel that launched 100 EVM chains and 10,000 tokens. Along the way, the continental drift pushing the two ecosystems apart has been expedited by Ethereum\u2019s move to Proof of Stake, leaving Bitcoin as the only top 20 coin aside from DOGE still wedded to Proof of Work. While the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are stark, they are not irreconcilable. One of the most fascinating aspects of the chains\u2019 evolving use cases is the way in which each has emulated the other. Ethereum is well on its way to becoming a somewhat stable store of value of its own, and looks poised to follow Bitcoin in receiving an ETF. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has belatedly spawned its own multi-chain and multi-token ecosystem thanks to Ordinals, BRC20, Runes, Stacks, and similar protocols. Bitcoin-native DeFi and NFTs are now a thing \u2013 even if most maximalists aren\u2019t on board. While it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin DeFi takes off, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s now more that unites the two chains than divides them. Bitcoin and Ethereum have moved in opposing directions over the years but their paths are finally starting to converge. Choose Tech, Not Tribalism Rather than arguing over whose tech trumps whose, or who implemented it first, there are clear benefits to the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities setting aside their differences. Just as globalism diminished petty tribalism (even if we simply swapped hating the guy in the next valley for hating internet strangers), the multi-chain era has rendered blockchain wars pointless. Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer isolated islands but interconnected hubs that routinely exchange value through bridges, portals, and wrappers. Isn\u2019t it time they started swapping developer talent too? The onus is on builders to find ways that both technology stacks can enhance one another. This is the key to scaling web3 and growing adoption. The rise of Ordinals has shown there is strong interest in utilizing the Bitcoin network as more than simply a means to store value. But building out further utility natively is complex since the network is not Turing complete by nature and its simplistic UTXO model and limited block space cannot handle complex data and calculations. While there have been many avenues explored for scaling Bitcoin, they all relied on a level of centralization until the Taproot upgrade which brought Schnorr Signature and MAST contracts. These upgrades have made it possible to design fully trustless bridges between the Bitcoin ecosystem and other networks, allowing for truly decentralized scaling solutions to be realized. The Ethereum ecosystem is already home to a robust suite of tools, smart contracts and applications that can be utilized to bring further compatibility and functionality to Bitcoin. It makes far more sense for Bitcoin to inherit the technology that already exists for certain functions rather than rebuild them from the ground up. Scale Bitcoin, Enhance Ethereum An obvious solution to scaling Bitcoin at the consumer level and building out new use cases is to utilize the functionality enabled by Taproot to create trustless bridges between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks. This can create a wave of new opportunities for both ecosystems by unlocking new ways for Bitcoin holders to engage while increasing the liquidity within Ethereum-based chains. While the possibility of utilizing EVM-compatible technology to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem is promising, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome will not be technological but cultural. While human ingenuity is boundless, our tendency to drag one another down like a bucket of crabs remains deeply ingrained. All crypto communities should strive to shun the cutthroat behaviors web2 was built on and find ways to collaborate. Only once this is done can web3 realize its full potential.

China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and other applicants posted on social media that they got clearance to list spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. However, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has yet to release an official list of approved issuers. According to the posts, the SFC greenlit China Asset Management to offer spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in partnership with OSL and BOCI International. Other approved issuers include Harvest Global Investments, HashKey Capital, and Bosera Asset Management. The news mirrors the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which launched in January and quickly attracted over $200 billion in trading volume. Hong Kong's approval marks a milestone as Asia's first jurisdiction to embrace spot Bitcoin ETFs. The ETFs provide exposure to actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, offering investors direct access to the assets. They also present a regulated investment vehicle that mitigates some of Bitcoin's risks. By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its Bitcoin-friendly stance amid ongoing efforts to become a finance hub. The accessibly traded funds could stimulate significant retail and institutional demand. However, an official SFC announcement remains pending. Some of the social media posts sharing the alleged approval have since been deleted. The opacity around permissions could contribute to market uncertainty in the near term. Nonetheless, the reported approvals signal a willingness by Hong Kong's regulators to meet surging investor appetite for Bitcoin.

Click here to download a PDF of this 7,000 word essay on the origins of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1] The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology. Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T\u2019s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks. The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity. But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation\u2014 it\u2019s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph. This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed\u2014and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future. Outline I. Decentralized systems are markets II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods III. How can decentralized systems price computations? IV. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin V. Conclusion A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai\u2019s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts \u201cfrom exactly that point.\u201d In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin.

Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented: Digital currencies should be P2P networks Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation Money is created through an auction Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins Transactions are batched into blocks Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work All blocks are stored by all participants Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn\u2019t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi\u2019s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list. Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place? This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi\u2019s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money. I. Decentralized systems are markets Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words \u201cdecentralized\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces. For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the topology of their network diagrams, but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets. Distributed systems rely upon central authorities In this work, we take \u201cdistributed\u201d to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as \u201cnodes\u201d) which must communicate, typically over a network. Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems. But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system. Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes. The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system. Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required. In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system. Decentralized systems have no central authorities We take \u201cdecentralized\u201d to have a stronger meaning than \u201cdistributed\u201d: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for \u201cdecentralized\u201d is \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d (P2P). Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems: Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry\u2014anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority. Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage. Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert. These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin: \"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of\u2026 centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" - Nakamoto, 2008 But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority. Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi\u2019s nod to Gnutella, anyone who\u2019s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online. Satoshi didn\u2019t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam. Decentralized systems are governed through incentives The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating. Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they\u2019re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly. The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market\u2019s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system. II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility. Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges. Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true\u2014traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane. This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems. Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems. Computation is the first decentralized good The first example of a \u201cdecentralized good\u201d is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3] Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources\u2014they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce. The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital \u201cproof\u201d that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given \u201cdifficulty\u201d which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority. The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called \u201cproof-of-work\u201d.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo\u2019s phrase, \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource: \"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource.\" - Dwoak & Naor, 1993 In Dwork & Naor\u2019s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email. Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a \u201cpricing function\u201d because, by adjusting the difficulty, a \u201cpricing authority\u201d could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a \u201cprice\u201d for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam. Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature \u201cpricing function\u201d and \u201cpricing authority\u201d supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource\u2019s controller. In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations. Currency is the second decentralized good But computations aren\u2019t a good currency. The proofs used to \u201ctrade\u201d computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can\u2019t be reused for a different input. Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider. This constraint is useful \u2013 it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender\u2019s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can\u2019t be respent for sending a different email. But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren\u2019t fungible, they can\u2019t be re-spent,[5] and they don\u2019t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash. Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems: \"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use.\" - Adam Back, 1997 We don\u2019t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market. Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere \u201caccess control mechanism\u201d. Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers\u2026in the units of the currency that\u2019s being created! Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives. Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure. The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints. Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it: Computations through proof-of-work Units of the currency we\u2019re trying to build The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy\u2014the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself! The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo\u2019s bit gold and Wei Dai\u2019s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded. III. How can decentralized systems price computations? A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency. We don\u2019t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called \u201cprogress\u201d. Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn\u2019t be progress\u2014it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value. When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable \u201cprices\u201d and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function. But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty\u2014 as measured by the number of corresponding computations\u2014may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price? Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold: \"The main problem\u2026is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract \"compute cycle.\" \u2026Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold.\" - Szabo, 2005 A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations. Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the \u201ccost of computing\u201d. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money: 'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.\" - Dai, 1998 Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a \u201cstandard basket\u201d, which computer solves a given problem \u201cmost economically\u201d, or the cost of computation on the \u201copen market\u201d. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems! To be fair to Dai, he realized this: \"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol.\" - Dai, 1998 Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let\u2019s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo\u2019s insights into the problem. Use external markets Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be \u201csecurely timestamped\u201d: \"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on.\" - Szabo, 2005 Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases \u201csecurely\u201d and \u201cdistributed fashion\u201d are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) \u201coutside the system\u201d services for timestamping.[6] The time a unit of digital currency was created is important because it links the computations performed to real-world production cost. Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right\u2014the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation: \"\u2026However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 \"Inferring\u201d the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible: \"\u2026Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold\u2026\" - Szabo, 2005 Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency: \"\u2026[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.\" - Szabo, 2005 To paraphrase Szabo, \u201cto assay the value of\u2026 bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp\u201d. The dealers defining \u201clarger units of approximately equal value\u201d are providing a similar pricing function as Dai\u2019s \u201cstandard basket of commodities\u201d. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger \u201cunits of approximately equal value\u201d by dealers in markets outside the network. To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw: \"\u2026The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address.\" - Szabo, 2005 Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money. Use internal markets Szabo\u2019s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it? Let\u2019s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi\u2019s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney\u2019s auction model[7]: \"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]\u2026 instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures. Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on. Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation. Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly.\" Dai, 1998 B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo\u2019s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other. But implementing Dai\u2019s proposal as written would be challenging: In the \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the \u201coptimal increase in the money supply for the next period\u201d. How \u201coptimal\u201d should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described. Regardless of what was planned, the \u201cBidding\u201d phase allows anyone to submit a \u201cbid\u201d to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money. Once bids are submitted, the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it\u2019s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted \u2013 when does the \u201cBidding\u201d phase end and the \u201ccomputation\u201d phase begin? These problems recur in the \u201cMoney ]reation\u201d phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of \u201chighest bids\u201d? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency? Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented. The root of this complexity is Dai\u2019s belief that the \u201coptimal\u201d rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create units of b-money by broadcasting a bid and then doing the corresponding proof-of-work. Both Szabo and Dai proposed using a market exchanging digital currency for computations yet neither bit gold nor b-money defined a monetary policy to regulate the supply of currency within this market.

Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi\u2019s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote: \"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\" - Satoshi, 2009 Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks\u2014with a concern about monetary policy. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The \u201coptimal\u201d rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi \u201cdiscovered\u201d bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. \u2014and not someone else. It\u2019s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply. A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It\u2019s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai\u2019s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let\u2019s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint. All 21M bitcoin already exist In b-money, each \u201cmoney creation period\u201d included a \u201cPlanning\u201d phase, in which users were expected to share their \u201cmacroeconomic calculations\u201d justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project. Satoshi was able to replace the recurring \u201cPlanning\u201d phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. This changes the semantics of bitcoin\u2019s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it\u2019s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that \u201cbitcoin miners create bitcoin\u201d. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they\u2019re buying it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t valuable because \u201cbitcoin are made from energy\u201d\u2014bitcoin\u2019s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. Let\u2019s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn\u2019t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus. Satoshi\u2019s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing \u201cPlanning\u201d phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin. Bitcoin is priced through consensus This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the \u201cBidding\u201d phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation \u201cbids\u201d from many different users. Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn\u2019t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi\u2019s predetermined schedule. The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8] The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi\u2019s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block: The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section): Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price. Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus \u201cblockchain\u201d containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain. Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy \u2013 just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented. This added complexity was removed by Satoshi\u2019s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Time closes all spreads In the \u201cComputation\u201d phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they\u2019d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller \u2013 but who is the buyer? In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner\u2019s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to \u201cexecute a trade\u201d but to pay the current asking price in computations. The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid\u2014the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network\u2019s current asking price. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008 Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin\u2019s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let\u2019s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn\u2019t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn\u2019t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. But Satoshi\u2019s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo\u2019s \u201csecure timestamping protocol.\u201d Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a \u201cdistributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,\u201d and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world \u201ctimechain\u201d rather than \u201cblockchain\u201d to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work market.[10] Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations. Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time. A standing order creates consensus The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the \u201cMoney creation\u201d phase of b-money. User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the \u201chighest bids\u2026in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created\u201d in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the \u201cByzantine generals\u201d or sometimes the \u201cdouble-spend\u201d problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem \u2013 socalled \u201cByzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms\u201d\u2014require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network\u2019s current asking price\u2014 nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner\u2019s resources. Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin\u2019s market has no phases\u2014it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network. This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] We established in previous sections that bitcoin\u2019s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! Moreover, this new \u201cNakamoto consensus\u201d only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing. IV. Conclusion B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi\u2019s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin\u2019s implementation. There is a lot more to bitcoin\u2019s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the \u201cprimary\u201d market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.

In particular, Ryan Gentry, Will Cole and Stephen Hall met with me weekly to debate these ideas. I would not have been able to overcome countless false starts without their contributions and their support. Ryan also helped me begin talking about these ideas publicly in our Bitcoin 2021 talk. Afsheen Bigdeli, Allen Farrington, Joe Kelly, Gigi, Tuur Demeester, and Marty Bent, have all encouraged me over the years and provided valuable feedback. I must also apologize to Allen for turning out to be such a lousy collaborator. Finally, Michael Goldstein may be better known for his writing & memes, but I\u2019d like to thank him for the archival work he does at the Nakamoto Institute to keep safe the history of digital currencies. Footnotes [1] The title of this series is taken from the first telegraph message in history, sent by Samuel Morse in 1844: \u201cWhat hath God wrought?\u201d.

[5] Hal Finney\u2019s RPOW project was an attempt at creating transferable proofs-of-work but bitcoin doesn\u2019t use this concept because it doesn't treat computations as currency. As we\u2019ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. [6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. [7] Dai\u2019s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi\u2019s white paper, available: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt [8]There are two simplifications being made here: a. The number of bitcoin being sold in each block is also affected by the transaction fee market, which is out of scope for this article, though lookout for subsequent work. b. The difficulty as reported by bitcoin is not exactly the number of expected computations; one must multiply by a proportionality factor.

You don\u2019t often see the term \u201cRoth IRA\u201d trending online, but in 2021, tech investor Peter Thiel made headlines for his $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA piggy bank. How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny. \u201cThiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.\u201d \u2013 ProPublica (2021) Let\u2019s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures. The different IRA structures The different IRA structures can behave in an \u201cevery square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares\u201d kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA. Brokerage and Bank IRAs Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The Unchained IRA is closest to this structure in this hierarchy. Self-directed IRA (SDIRA) A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn\u2019t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that are not allowed (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.). Checkbook IRA Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (\u201ccheckbook control\u201d). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA. Non-checkbook self-directed IRA A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).

Click here to hold the keys to your retirement using Unchained's collaborative custody financial services. Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA 1. Liquidity Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy. 2. Formation and legal structure When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account. With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA. 3. Misreporting transactions Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions. At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit fair market valuation (FMV) information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law. 4. \u201cDeemed distribution\u201d treatment Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of \u201cdeemed distributions\u201d treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC\u2019s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the LLC\u2019s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA. It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying \u201cdeemed distribution\u201d treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to IRS Publication 590, it\u2019s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. Read more about the McNulty case and its implications. 5. Prohibited transactions All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. \u201cSelf-dealing\u201d is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself\u2014not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide \u201csweat equity.\u201d It\u2019s not only the IRA owner that can\u2019t participate in any \u201cself-dealing,\u201d but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and penalties are stiff. These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don\u2019t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the IRS list of prohibited transactions here. Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors: Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets Leverage without a non-recourse loan Investing in certain collectible NFTs1 6. Financing Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons: Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases. Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits. IRA-owned active businesses could run into the issue of UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin mining within an IRA. Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA\u2019s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs. What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs? The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls. Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA If you\u2019re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It\u2019s not a \u201ccheckbook IRA\u201d where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations. There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it\u2019ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time \u2013 adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope \u2013 ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it\u2019s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the experience of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal\u2019s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0 is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions \u2013 but don\u2019t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network \u2013 we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we do broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork \u2013 presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we\u2019ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can\u2019t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) \u201cLayer Connector\u201d that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs! With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes) A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per \u201clayer\u201d (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.) The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the \u201cDispatcher\u201d. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn\u2019t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can\u2019t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the \u201cparent\u201d. In order for miners to capture the fees from this \u201cchild\u201d transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10\u2019s or 100\u2019s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we\u2019d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would: look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the \u201csplit\u201d transaction here: https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb. The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn\u2019t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas. Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. There are other aspects of the project that we haven\u2019t covered here \u2013 how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one\u2019s easy: it\u2019s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. This is a guest post by Rijndael.

The country has since bet big on Bitcoin, building Bitcoin reserves, mining BTC, and launching educational initiatives. However, the IMF has objected to the Bitcoin law amid loan negotiations with El Salvador, which needs financing to pay debts and obligations. Talks have stalled for nearly two years over the IMF's calls to limit Bitcoin's scope in the country. According to the IMF's communications director Julie Kozack on last Thursday, the \"risks\" of Bitcoin remain a key issue in discussions with El Salvador. The IMF has previously cited financial integrity and stability concerns about Bitcoin. The fund's opposition highlights a clash over the future of money and payments. While Bukele sees Bitcoin as an innovative solution for financial inclusion, the IMF remains wary of its volatility and decentralized nature, and a threat to their dominance. Irrespective of pressures, El Salvador has stood firm on its Bitcoin commitment. The country has invested over $150 million in BTC reserves, continually buying more. Bukele also pledged to purchase 1 BTC daily. The IMF loan impasse puts El Salvador in a difficult fiscal position. By tying loan access to changes in El Salvador's Bitcoin law, the IMF is exerting its influence over poorer nations. But Bukele seems unwilling to back down on Bitcoin, creating an ideological tug-of-war. El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin adoption signaled a shift toward decentralization and self-determination. Demands to roll back the Bitcoin law undermine the country's monetary sovereignty. The standoff illustrates the disruptive potential of Bitcoin to reshape global finance. While risky for El Salvador in the near-term, Bukele's Bitcoin bet could pay long-run dividends.","article_summary":"The IMF is reportedly demanding changes to El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin law amid $1.4 billion credit negotiations, underscoring tensions over Bitcoin's disruptive potential.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-12T18:17:16Z","category":["el salvador"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/imf-demands-changes-to-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-report","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTg0MjMzMzU2NjAxMzM3Njg1/nayib-bukele-bitcoin-el-salvador.png"},{"article_title":"TD Bank Releases Commercial Explaining The Bitcoin Halving And Promotes ETFs","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"TD Bank subsidiary TD Direct Investing recently uploaded a video on its YouTube channel explaining in detail the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around April 19 or 20.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event. What is Bitcoin halving? The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors. Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving. 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I\u2019ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren. 5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that\u2019s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs. Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a \"hodling\" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income? Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment. 5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively. Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving Efficiency is Key: Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem. Strategic Planning: Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols. Adapt and Evaluate: Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards. Collaborative Mining: Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards. Leverage Mining Solutions: Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving. What is the difficulty of mining after halving? The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa. Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include: Mining Altcoins: While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue. Mining Pools and Services: Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects. Hardware Sales and Leasing: Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations. Staking and Masternodes: Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees. Blockchain Development and Consulting: Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting. Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments: Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies. Energy Trading and Grid Services: Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs. Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions: Price Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics. Speculative Activity: Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions. Market Sentiment: Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines. Miner Behavior: The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics. Macro-Economic Factors: External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements. Long-Term Outlook: Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest. While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved. Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition? Efficiency Improvements: One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs. Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing: Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability. Vertical Integration: Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams. Diversification of Revenue Streams: As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments. Hedging Strategies: Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions. Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability. Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions. To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events: November 28, 2012: Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. July 9, 2016: The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. May 20, 2020: The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch \u2014 a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years \u2013 will see Bitcoin\u2019s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. ~94% of the total #bitcoin supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days 👀 Digital scarcity at its finest 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024 Gold Throughout the Ages One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a \u201cfine man\u2019s suit\u201d over time. This principle, known as the \u201cgold-to-decent-suit ratio,\u201d can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga. While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man\u2019s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges. For example, the cost of verification \u2013 or assaying \u2013 gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value. Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous \u201dNixon Shock\u201d in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good. This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. Executive Order 6102 comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited \u201cthe hoarding of gold coin\u201d, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value. Bitcoin\u2019s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven? Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals. As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years \u2013 reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024. Source: Glassnode While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a store of value better than gold, it is certainly promising. This \u201cmagic internet money\u201d continues to rapidly gain on gold\u2019s estimated $15.9 trillion market capitalization. Gold\u2019s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals. Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its informational nature, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute. Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s network of nodes and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns. Conclusion Bitcoin\u2019s rise as a monetary good \u2013 predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable \u2013 has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold\u2019s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement. While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time. Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s time to shine.","article_summary":"For the first time, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is set to surpass gold after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China. Hong Kong\u2019s new ETF has been in the making for several months now, and it\u2019s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it\u2019s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) already passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it\u2019s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market. Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of big players from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media reported that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city. Considering that there are already signs of diminishing ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn\u2019t Bitcoin banned in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis report $90 billion worth of transactions in one year? Source Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves many windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: \u201cIf you get scammed, don\u2019t expect our help or sympathy.\" Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions. It\u2019s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it\u2019s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they\u2019ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have invested heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that\u2019s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. Click the image to learn more. Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong\u2019s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin\u2019s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? As far as Hong Kong\u2019s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local banks shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. The South China Morning Post reported on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new \u201cGlobal\u201d initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to \u201covertake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\" A very tall order. And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the Post that \u201cWe have seen their data and we don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be difficult\u201d. He added that most global competitors are either \u201ceasy to use but not compliant\u201d, or \u201ccompliant but hard to use\u201d, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It\u2019s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to offer nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business\u2019 reigning champs won\u2019t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was reportedly mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city\u2019s own existing firms are confident that they\u2019ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? It\u2019s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It\u2019s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.","article_summary":"With Hong Kong asset managers somewhat reluctant to submit applications for the new ETF, a series of multibillion-dollar firms from Mainland China have entered the market.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-11T21:00:00Z","category":["bitcoin etf","hong kong","markets","bitcoin magazine pro"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count. Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. \u201cThe early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for \u2018crypto\u2019 venture\u2019s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,\u201d said Calicott. \u201cWith a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.\u201d In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested. \u201cDue to cyclicality and bitcoin\u2019s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,\u201d Calicott continued. \u201cDespite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.\u201d TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.

Sound Advisory provides financial advisory services and specializes in educating and guiding clients to thrive financially in a bitcoin-powered world. Click here to learn more. One of the simplest and most effective ways to improve your financial situation: Don\u2019t get killed on taxes. Taxes are a major friction in most people\u2019s financial lives, and a little foresight and planning can go a long way. This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. Let\u2019s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies. Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back. The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how: KYC Compliance: All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings. Transaction History: Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions. Reporting to IRS: Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains. Legal Precedents: The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions. Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly. Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season. To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments. Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year. Source: Sound Advisory If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income. Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin\u2014bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. Strategies and Case Studies Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn\u2019t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. When accounting for transactions, it\u2019s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. The IRS allows for \u201cspecific identification\u201d accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item\u2014in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains. Scenario: Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000. With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000). With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000). HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case. These would be short-term capital gains, so let\u2019s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. It\u2019s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly. Tax loss harvesting Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we\u2019ll leave it here for future readers. In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price. Scenario: Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved. Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the tax loss carry forward technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains. If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain\u2019t so bad. Sign me up. I\u2019ll even pay it twice. And \u201ctaxable income\u201d is calculated after the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single). Scenario: Let\u2019s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free). And we\u2019ll assume that they live in one of the nine US states that don\u2019t have an income tax, so let\u2019s call it 0% state tax as well. It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free\u2014valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a strategic sell and immediate rebuy opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies Roth IRA conversions or liquidating assets through installment sales. Gifting We\u2019ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people. Charity When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed. Scenario: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he\u2019d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains. You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to have less bitcoin!\u201d If bitcoin holders are familiar with \u201cspend and replace,\u201d we can consider a similar strategy like \u201cdonate and replace.\u201d You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes. Donor-advised funds For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a \"charitable savings account\": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time. Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications. Friends and family Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you). Scenario: A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their \u201clifetime bucket.\u201d Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. Roth accounts Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability. If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings. If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution. Conclusion The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you. With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort. A note on wash sales The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin. Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended. Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit. It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency. 1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events. 2) These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. CONTACT Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

","author":"Ivan Serrano","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin has shown itself among the best-performing assets in the last decade. In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250\u2014a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset briefly touched $70,000 recently. With this kind of growth, it\u2019s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to \u201cHODL\" until it reaches new price highs. However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC? Bitcoin loans offer a solution that provides access to liquidity without letting go of your holdings. How does a Bitcoin loan work? Here, we delve into the unique mechanics of a Bitcoin loan. We discuss how the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the world of finance beyond trading by providing alternative means to secure loans while retaining access to potentially higher returns in the future. Click the image to learn more. Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments\u2014similar to how a bank operates. Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent\u2014thus becoming overcollateralized loans. How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings. Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: Risks associated with rehypothecation Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties. With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral\u2014or even 100 percent\u2014is at risk. Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on. Annual percentage rate (APR) The annual percentage rate, also known as the APR, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. LTV requirement The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates. Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV) The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. Tax implications Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best.

The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don\u2019t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification. Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.

Or is it the Laser-Eyed Maxis? Or is it both? The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it\u2019s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don\u2019t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn\u2019t have that, you likely didn\u2019t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. That dogma was necessary \u2014 without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn\u2019t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. Click the image above to subscribe! Which Church Do You Go To? The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn\u2019t die \u2014 it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn\u2019t destroy it \u2014 they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther\u2019s famous Theses. What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. The Protestants\u2019 Disgust With Indulgences So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let\u2019s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences \u2014 the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, \u201cAs soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs\u201d. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. \u201cJust follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.\u201d Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they\u2019re undeniable. In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that \u201cthis one simple trick\u201d is enough to guarantee an individual\u2019s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can\u2019t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It\u2019s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. Here\u2019s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn\u2019t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people \u2014 roughly the same size as the Catholic population \u2014 Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther\u2019s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one\u2019s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn\u2019t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. Dissent Breeds Dissent Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn\u2019t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it\u2019s simply a matter of survival. And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single \u201cProtestant\u201d dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as \u201cagainst\u201d the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as \u201cdoing what the Laser Eyes couldn\u2019t\u201d as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around \u201cowning the Laser Eyes\u201d. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? The JPEG People claim they are here to \u201cmake Bitcoin fun again\u201d, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to \u201cown the Laser Eyes\u201d. That doesn\u2019t produce anything of value. That doesn\u2019t actually inspire people with a vision. Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own. So what is the identity of the JPEG People without Laser Eyes to troll? Is there even one there when you take that away?

Regulators there are expected to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs in Asia this month, potentially adding more volume. ETF providers cite surging institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The funds present an easy vehicle for both retail and professional investors to gain bitcoin price exposure. The $200 billion cumulative volume indicates growing bitcoin's maturation since the last bull run when ETF hopes were repeatedly dashed.

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it\u2019s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they\u2019ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network. The Liquidity Crunch The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator\u2019s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. For now let\u2019s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they should have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they have processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users\u2019 money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? The Options The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. So now that we understand the problem let\u2019s look at some potential solutions. Throttling You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. The problem with this is you don\u2019t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don\u2019t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. Multiple Operators Both BitVM 1 and BitVM 2 support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator\u2019s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator. It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren\u2019t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. Multiple Linear Operators In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. The Backstop In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users\u2019 funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist. So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users\u2019 funds and make them whole. I don\u2019t think this is that bad. Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users\u2019 funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. Wrapping Up At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users\u2019 funds, to losing operators\u2019 funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I\u2019ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first.","article_summary":"An analysis of the recent criticism of BitVM based two way pegs published by Taproot Wizards.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-10T01:40:00Z","category":["opinion","bitvm","technical","bitvm 2","bitvm pegs"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"},{"article_title":"The U.S. Needs To Lead in Bitcoin, Says Congressman Patrick McHenry","author":"Nik Hoffman","article_detailed_content":"At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington DC today, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) emphasized the importance of the United States taking a leadership role in Bitcoin and not lagging behind in during a fireside chat with Club for Growth President David McIntosh.

Japanese Public Company Is Buying Bitcoin","author":"Vivek Sen","article_detailed_content":"Japanese firm Metaplanet announced it is purchasing 1 billion yen (about $6.5 million) worth of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, a move that mimics MicroStrategy's high-profile Bitcoin accumulation. Metaplanet, a publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a diversified enterprise, revealed the Bitcoin buying initiative on X. The company cited hedging risks from currency devaluation and inflation as motivations. The announcement said the purchase is an \"initial commitment\" and part of a broader embrace of Bitcoin's potential. Partners like legendary hedge fund manager Mark Yusko, UTXO Management, and Sora Ventures support it. By adopting a Bitcoin treasury reserve similar to MicroStrategy, Metaplanet aims to benefit from Bitcoin's upside while mitigating risks. MicroStrategy has pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, buying over $6 billion worth of BTC since 2020.

The move also provides Japanese investors indirect Bitcoin exposure without high unrealized gains taxes, which can reach 55% in Japan. Metaplanet's Bitcoin funds will be held in a tax-advantaged structure only accessible by the company. By buying Bitcoin, Metaplanet joins the growing list of public companies utilizing Bitcoin to maximize shareholder value. With MicroStrategy proving the model's effectiveness, more institutional adoption is likely. For Metaplanet, Bitcoin offers opportunities beyond investment gains like accelerating its Bitcoin initiatives. The announcement is a bullish sign for Bitcoin's traction in Asia.

Bitcoin Magazine is partnering with BPI to host a live stream of the event on its YouTube channel and social media platforms. With a lineup featuring politicians Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), Wiley Nickel (D-NC), Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), the summit is gearing up to be a nexus of Bitcoin and the political sphere in the United States. The participation of the aforementioned lawmakers underscores a clear bipartisan recognition of the importance of understanding and shaping the future of Bitcoin and digital asset policy work. Notably, Senators Lummis and Gillibrand have co-authored legislation in the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act. The bill, drafted in 2022, is a significant example of an emerging bipartisan effort to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Senator Gillibrand expressed her excitement for the upcoming summit, stating in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cAs a leader on this issue, I look forward to sharing my ideas and hearing from attendees on how we can write smart policy that allows for responsible innovation, has robust consumer protections, and enables us to root out bad actors.\u201d As the growth and economic integration of Bitcoin and digital assets continues, the summit's agenda reflects challenges and opportunities presented therein. Discussions will explore into the regulatory frameworks governing Bitcoin financial products and services as well as strategies to foster innovation while protecting civil liberties. \u201cAs a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I'm working to find common ground and advance common sense legislation on Bitcoin and crypto,\u201d said Congressman Wiley Nickel. \u201cI look forward to sharing an update on the work that we\u2019re doing and hoping to accomplish during the rest of the 118th Congress.\u201d Geopolitical considerations will take the stage in the \u201cGeopolitics of Bitcoin\u201d panel featuring SentinelOne Director Matthew Pines, BlockTrace Head of Operations Ken Egan, Bridger Solutions Co-founder and CEO Jake Langenkamp, and Foundry Vice President of Public Policy Kyle Schneps, as they analyze the implications of Bitcoin and digital assets for the dollar monetary system and global power dynamics. The summit will also examine the environmental and climate impacts of bitcoin mining operations. Panelists Troy Cross, a Professor at Reed College, and Brian Consolvo Partner at KPMG, are set to speak in a fireside chat: \u201cHow Institutions Consider Bitcoin\u2019s Sustainability\u201d. In addition, the use of geothermal energy will be a focal point as the Office Director for the Geothermal Technologies for the U.S. Department of Energy, Lauren Boyd, will also be hosted as a summit participant. \"The annual Bitcoin Policy Summit represents a unique opportunity for collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders from diverse backgrounds,\u201d stated David Zell, Founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute. \u201cBy fostering an inclusive conversation, we can develop informed and effective policies that support innovation while safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders.\" For more information about the annual Bitcoin Policy Summit, including the full agenda and list of speakers, visit BPI\u2019s website here.

One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. I really liked Dhruv\u2019s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows: Version 1: The Commonly Held View The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you\u2019d describe this is \u201c6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.\u201d Version 2: Dhruv\u2019s View ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term \u201creleased\u201d to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term \u201cunlocked\u201d for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv\u2019s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv\u2019s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. Why is Dhruv\u2019s framing important? By framing mining as buying coins rather than creating coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? If miners are creating bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an \"inefficiency of scale\" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *purchasing* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don\u2019t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. Layer zero is what I\u2019d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin that already exist to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn\u2019t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a \u201ctwo sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.\u201d The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price collectively for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers \u201cwins the auction\u201d using Dhruv\u2019s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES. The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, \u201cEach of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says \u2018what were the most recent bids in time?\u2019 and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.\u201d The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users and the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero? What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says \u201cit\u2019s computations for bitcoin.\u201d Layer 0 is a \u201cmarket between two aggregates.\u201d It\u2019s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two \u201cparticipants\u201d in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work. The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think \u201chow wasteful,\" think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv\u2019s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. There are some who believe that transaction costs won\u2019t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future.

This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything? If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. Verifying Things Yourself When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network\u2019s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network Most people likely don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s bitcoin payments, if you aren\u2019t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. The Supply Cap The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not the, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. Keeping Your Bitcoin Private Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else\u2019s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. Why This is All Important While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits. Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don\u2019t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else\u2019s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin\u2019s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it\u2019s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador\u2019s government uses Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, multiple defenses of Lightning\u2019s long-term viability as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network grew to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users\u2019 money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to question if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly quit the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes both the protocol\u2019s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, \u201ceveryone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people\u201d to Lightning, a \u201cmicroscopic\u201d amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, \u201calmost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it\u201d amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning\u2019s future prospects has emerged, as the network\u2019s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high. Source Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued optimism and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay secured $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes. This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase finalized a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange\u2019s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark\u2019s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to \u201cinscribe\u201d unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to inscribe discontinued video games. Download the full 20-page research report prepared by Tuur Demeester (Founder, Adamant Research) for Unchained. This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, claimed that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a \u201cvulnerability\u201d in Bitcoin, one that is being \u201cexploited... to spam the blockchain.\" The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been linked to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to \u201cfix\u201d this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals\u2019 continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance quoted their \u201congoing efforts to streamline product offerings\u201d as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning\u2019s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin\u2019s usability, while Ordinals\u2019 critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it\u2019s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr\u2019s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly rejected by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even endorsed Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a \u201crenaissance\u201d in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin\u2019s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain\u2019s flexibility and superiority over its competitors. Praise like this from such an important source could truly be groundbreaking. Events like this serve, more than anything, to prove once again that Bitcoin\u2019s spirit is not merely posed to disrupt established industries and build a more rational order on the wreckage. Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin\u2019s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It\u2019s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.","article_summary":"The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a \u201cdead end\u201d as capacity drops.

The halving (also known as the \u201cHalvening\u201d) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the \u201cblock subsidy\u201d) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain. The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin\u2019s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. . WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING? The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period \u2014 or epoch \u2014 will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE Determine the block interval: While it\u2019s true that Bitcoin\u2019s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments. Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you\u2019re running one. Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin\u2019s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height. Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving. Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected. Current block height: can be found here. Block time: can be found here. Current date: xx/xx/xxxx Blocks per epoch: 210,000 Next halving block height: 210,000 times next halving number Calculation: (((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it\u2019s important to keep running the calculation. HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS As of March 2024, there have been three Bitcoin halvings: On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. On July 9, 2016, the second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. On May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. BITCOIN HALVING 2012 The 2012 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s first halving. Halving: Date: November 28, 2012 Halving number: 01 Block height: 210,000 Block reward: 25 Mined supply: 10,500,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 5,250,000 Percentage of mined supply: 25% BITCOIN HALVING 2016 The 2016 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s second halving. Halving: Date: July 9, 2016 Halving number: 01 Block height: 420,000 Block reward: 12.5 Mined supply: 15,750,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 2,625,000 Percentage of mined supply: 12.5% BITCOIN HALVING 2020 The 2020 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s third halving.

Halving: Date: April 19, 2024 (estimated) Halving number: 04 Block height: 840,000 Block reward: 3.125 Mined supply: 19,687,500 (amount of bitcoin issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 656,250 Percentage of mined supply: 3.125% FUTURE BITCOIN HALVINGS The blocktime variable will introduce some variance in estimated halving dates, but it is possible to project approximate dates until the conclusion of block subsidies in 2140. Below, we provide a succinct overview of anticipated halving dates from 2024 to 2060, offering valuable insights into these upcoming milestones. Epoch Number Block height Halving Year Estimated Halving Date 04 (of 32) 840,000 2024 April 20, 2024 05 (of 32) 1,050,000 2028 2028 06 (of 32) 1,260,000 2032 2032 07 (of 32) 1,470,000 2036 2036 08 (of 32) 1,680,000 2040 2040 09 (of 32) 1,890,000 2044 2044 10 (of 32) 2,100,000 2048 2048 11 (of 32) 2,310,000 2052 2052 12 (of 32) 2,520,000 2056 2056 (cont\u2026) HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BITCOIN HALVING Halving events have consistently preceded significant increases in bitcoin\u2019s price, making them a focal point for market analysts. Price Appreciation Historically, bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced significant upswings following halving events due to the combination of reduced supply and increased demand. These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events. After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800. After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000. Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years. Challenges for Miners Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network\u2019s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin\u2019s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. FAQs: Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin\u2019s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it\u2019s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling. Is Bitcoin halving bullish? The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it\u2019s wise to remember that bitcoin\u2019s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak? A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. Should you buy bitcoin before the halving? Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it\u2019s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles.","article_summary":"As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway.

Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history. Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead. On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1 EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. As such, it\u2019s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners\u2019 interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it\u2019s the quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it\u2019s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody. Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there\u2019s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don\u2019t pay your taxes. For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again. However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on why FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR\u2019s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that \u201cwithout his New Deal, we would all have been lost.\u201d2 On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and \u201caccustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.\u201d3 All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is how FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. This is because, despite the fact that FDR\u2019s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America\u2019s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), \u201crule by personal decree\u201d4, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher. This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans\u2019 rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency \u201cNow, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes\u201d - Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses I\u2019m not sure anyone\u2019s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole not been Machiavellian enough, but in this case the historical record is clear. Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), \u2018disregarding the laws for good objects\u2019 has been practically a job requirement of the oval office. Carl Schmitt said that \u201cSovereign is he who decides on the exception.\u201d Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit \u2018extra-constitutional\u2019 exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt\u2019s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice. In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp. The phrase is \u201cnational emergency\u201d. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you\u2019re an American adult, it\u2019s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the \u2018anti-terrorism\u2019 provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19. In fact, it\u2019s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the \u2018national emergency\u2019 has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 National Emergencies Act. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.5 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States To give you a sense of the temporal nature of these \u2018emergencies\u2019, there are still in effect: 9 from the Obama administration, 10 from Bush II, 5 from Clinton, and even one from Jimmy Carter in 1979! This is what Milton Friedman was talking about when he said \u201cNothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.\u201d This is also the story of Executive Order 6102, for it too sprouted from an official national emergency. You can read this in order itself, where FDR states in the preamble: \u201cI, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist\u2026\u201d Executive Order 6102, 5 April 1933 But still, the story goes deeper. It\u2019s not just enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case in 1933. So what was FDR\u2019s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold? The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first. The Beginning: Principled Piracy In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia. About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the Rapid, to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the Jefferson, who claimed the ship\u2019s goods as a prize. Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the Jefferson. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.6 Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. \u201cBut\u201d, (I hear you interject), \u201cBy what definition could an \u2018American with gold\u2019 be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn\u2019t even a war in 1933!\u201d Fantastic points, and you\u2019re right to make them. To preface the answer, let\u2019s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major \u2018philosophies\u2019 that you might subscribe to. Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn\u2019t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these \u2018philosophies\u2019 help judges decide the \u2018right\u2019 way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that\u2019s another story). If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A \u2018Living Constitution\u2019 approach: where you basically say, \u2018to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today\u2019. The third approach is more or less how the law around \u2018national emergencies\u2019 has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate \u2018natural selection\u2019 evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast. So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. Now let\u2019s fill in the gaps and show how that happened. 1917: National Emergencies Go Up There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five. One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the Espionage Act, was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today. This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under. 1917 was also the first time the phrase \u201cnational emergency\u201d passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America\u2019s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.7 Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin\u2019 violation. This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since The Rapid, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle. The solution was the Trading with the Enemy Act, which brought the principle of The Rapid into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to \u201cdefine, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.\u201d8 In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.9 Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, \u201cperhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.\u201d10 This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives. For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.11 Source: New York Herald on March 28, 1918, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ This was all authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story. That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in \u201cforeign exchange\u201d, or by any foreign country.12 You might sense now that we\u2019re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness. But we\u2019re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President\u2019s power in 1917 was still limited to \u201cduring the time of war.\u201d13 It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it. Great Depression: FDR\u2019s Opportunity That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis. Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank\u2019s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would \u201cno longer take responsibility\u201d for the bank\u2019s \u201cdeficient reserves\u201d.14 What was going on? Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a \u2018gold standard\u2019 was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.15 The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country. However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government\u2019s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. Meanwhile, \u201call of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.\u201d16 FDR\u2019s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. He called out the \u201cunscrupulous money changers\u201d, and the \u201cfalsity of material wealth\u201d, and demanded that \u201cthere must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\u201d17 Now, if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a \u201cbroad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.\u201d18 It was all downhill from there. Two days after FDR\u2019s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a \u2018Bank Holiday\u2019 from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the \u201choarding\u201d.19 Stopping the run wasn\u2019t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting \u201cthe names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.\u201d20 On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate \u201cany transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.\u201d21 Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the Trading with the Enemy Act restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR\u2019s inaugural address, the Emergency Banking Act (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality. Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce \u201cduring time of war\u201d, or crucially, \u201cduring any other period of national emergency declared by the President.\u201d FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: \u201cHOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty\u201d22 This brings us to the end of the story. From The Rapid, to the Trading with the Enemy Act, to the Emergency Banking Act, to Executive Order 6102. The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn\u2019t. Conclusion: Could It Happen Again? Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin? Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes. The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn\u2019t control; Government wasn\u2019t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff. The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024. This isn\u2019t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either. The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. What does the next national emergency look like? A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities23 trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? We don\u2019t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate. In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of Alice in Wonderland\u2019s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff. Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a chance at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation. So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins. And see you in hell, FDR.

The regulator alleged that Sun \u201ctraveled extensively\u201d to the US while he and several companies carried out unregistered offers and sales of BTT and TRX tokens. According to the watchdog, Sun spent over 380 days in the US between 2017 and 2019 and made business trips to major cities, including New York City, Boston, Massachusetts, and San Francisco. He carried out the trips on behalf of the Tron Foundation and the BitTorrent Foundation \u2014 both of which are also named as defendants in the case. The SEC wants to use these trips to claim jurisdiction over Sun and the companies to pursue regulatory and legal action in the US. Wash trading The SEC alleged that Sun and the companies engaged in a wash trading scheme on the now-defunct crypto exchange Bittrex. Though the original complaint identified many of the same wash trading activities, it identified the exchange on which wash trading took place only as an unnamed \u201ctrading platform.\u201d The agency included the fact that Bittrex is based in the US alongside its other claims to personal jurisdiction over Sun and the other defendants. The amended complaint also alleges that Sun personally communicated with and provided documents to Bittrex circa 2018 to have the exchange list the TRX crypto. The documents link Sun to the other companies, and Sun personally signed some documents. Countering the request for dismissal The latest allegations address the concerns raised by Sun in his request to dismiss the SEC case in March due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Defense lawyers argued that Sun is a foreign national and not \u201cat home\u201d in the US and advanced similar arguments for the companies. The request for dismissal also identified the supposed improper distributions on Bittrex but said that \u201cthere is no allegation that any US resident purchased or attempted to purchase TRX on this unidentified platform, or that the effort to list TRX succeeded.\u201d The SEC sued Sun and the other defendants in March 2023. At the time, it primarily based personal jurisdiction claims around the allegation that sales focused on investors in the Southern District of New York and the allegation that celebrity promoters contacted individuals in the US via social media. The SEC separately sued Bittrex in April 2023 and settled the case in August 2023. The company halted operations globally in late 2023.

The report \u2014 called \u201cA Primer on Bitcoin Cross-Border Flows\u201d \u2014 sheds light on how the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is being leveraged to bypass traditional banking systems, especially in regions experiencing economic distress or strict capital controls. Necessary financial tool According to the IMF, residents of countries with restrictive financial regulations are turning to Bitcoin to move capital across borders more freely. The report highlighted significant transaction volumes originating from countries like Argentina and Venezuela, where citizens face hyperinflation and stringent financial controls. In these regions, Bitcoin has become a necessary financial tool for preserving wealth and accessing global markets rather than just a speculative investment. One of the report\u2019s authors, Eugenio Cerutti, wrote: \u201cBitcoin transactions provide a way for individuals in high-inflation countries to stabilize their savings and participate in global commerce on terms that aren\u2019t possible through their local currencies.\u201d However, the IMF report also cautioned against the potential risks associated with the widespread use of Bitcoin for cross-border flows. The lack of oversight and the anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies can complicate the efforts of regulators to monitor and control financial transactions to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering. On-chain volume The study reviewed both on-chain and off-chain transaction data to explore the trends behind Bitcoin\u2019s use across borders. It found that Bitcoin transactions are not only substantial in volume but also exhibit unique characteristics compared to traditional capital flows. Unlike typical foreign investments that are sensitive to economic indicators like currency strength, Bitcoin flows show a higher correlation with cryptocurrency-specific sentiments, such as market volatility and user sentiment indexes \u2014 like the Fear and Greed Index. The analysis also pointed out that on-chain Bitcoin transactions, which are recorded on the blockchain and offer more security, tend to be larger than off-chain transactions. This indicates that the robust security features of blockchain technology often protect larger financial stakes.

Scaramucci also predicted that Bitcoin will surpass the market capitalization of gold in the coming years as it matures as an asset class and the regulatory landscape becomes more accepting. Adoption curve He emphasized that Bitcoin might not stabilize as a reliable inflation hedge or store of value until it surpasses a billion users, which suggests continued volatility in the near term. \u201cBitcoin is on an adoption curve.

Former Blockchain Association member Jake Chervinsky called the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d on April 17. He warned that the bill would only permit centralized and custodial stablecoins. Chervinsky added that the proposed ban violates principles outlined in his testimony to Congress in 2023. He said in his testimony that legislators should focus on regulating custodial stablecoins and avoid regulating algorithmic stablecoins until further study. Aaron Day, Chairman and CEO of the Daylight Freedom Foundation and a Brownstone Institute fellow, also opposed the proposed ban on algorithmic stablecoins and asserted the bill would benefit banks rather than crypto. He argued that banks\u2019 involvement in stablecoins \u201csets the stage\u201d for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). However, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly said it has no intention to issue a CBDC due to the Fed Now system. Shift from FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett said the Lummis-Gillibrand bill initially did not include such harsh restrictions, based on her sources in Washington, DC. Terret said lawmakers aimed to reach \u201cmoderate positions on \u2026 contentious issues,\u201d including but not limited to the bill\u2019s proposed restrictions on algorithmic stablecoins. Her sources did not reveal why lawmakers shifted their initial perspective but said that all affected parties are \u201cnot particularly excited about the bill\u201d in its current state despite its nominally bipartisan support. The sources added that the bill is mainly a sign of growing pressure for stablecoin regulation in the Senate and an indirect attempt to have lawmakers engage in a separate stablecoin bill led by House Financial Services Committee chair Patrick McHenry. Bill bans unbacked stablecoins. One section of the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, as introduced on April 17, explicitly prohibits unbacked algorithmic stablecoins. The bill and its backing members do not describe any incident to justify the proposed ban. However, the collapse of Terraform Labs\u2019 algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD in May 2022 has likely played a role in the lawmakers\u2019 decision to include the prohibition in the legislation. The collapse \u2014 which wiped $80 billion in value from the crypto market in May 2022 \u2014 has raised concerns about algorithmic approaches to valuation \u2014 even as other competing algorithmic stablecoins such as Ampleforth (USDD), Frax (FRAX), and Ampleforth (AMPL) continue to circulate close to the value of the US dollar. Instead, the bill only permits depository institutions and non-depository trust institutions to issue stablecoins and does not set out a clear path to compliance for existing stablecoin firms. The bill also aims to prevent the illegal use of stablecoins and creates separate federal and state regulatory regimes, among other specific requirements.

This announcement was made during Wood\u2019s presentation on Polkadot\u2019s future at the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai. Web3 Foundation, the entity behind Polkadot, further announced a 10 Million DOT prize pool to foster diversity within the development of the JAM protocol. According to the firm: \u201cThe JAM Implementer\u2019s Prize is designed to catalyze this by funding and supporting projects that contribute to the development of JAM implementations from the outset.\u201d What is JAM? JAM is a decentralized hybrid system designed to offer secure and scalable smart contract functionalities. It combines certain features from Ethereum within Polkadot\u2019s architectural framework. Polkadot said: \u201cJAM is a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. It is a prospective path to replace the Relay Chain with a more modular, minimalistic design.\u201d Web3 Foundation added that JAM would allow Polkadot to run generic \u201cservices,\u201d smart contract logic to process the execution result on cores. A parachains service will run existing Substrate-based parachains, meaning developers can still use Substrate to develop and deploy their blockchains. In essence, JAM provides a global singleton permissionless object environment\u2014akin to Ethereum\u2019s smart-contract environment\u2014paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network. Goku, a supporter of the blockchain network, explained that the upgrade would allow Polkadot to become \u201ca true multi-core world computer capable of handling any type of service or app without scalability, security, or efficiency issues.\u201d He added: \u201c[Polkadot] has already become a multi-core processor, but this was limited to parachains. The idea is to generalize this even further, to be utterly unopinionated about what and how things are deployed, turning all parachains, aka rollups, into an application layer service, with Polkadot transforming into something akin to cloud service infrastructure.\u201d Meanwhile, the proposed upgrade would continue to utilize the network\u2019s DOT token. Following the news, the digital asset bucked its current downward trend to rise by around 3% to as high as $7. However, it has retraced to $6.62 as of press time. It should be noted that the JAM upgrade is still subject to Polkadot\u2019s community approval via the network\u2019s on-chain, decentralized governance.

With the next one just around the corner, how are miners behaving this time? Next Bitcoin Halving Is Less Than Two Days Away Now In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed Bitcoin miners\u2019 behavior in the build-up to the next Halving. The \u201cHalving\u201d is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the cryptocurrency\u2019s block rewards (the compensation miners receive for solving blocks) are permanently slashed in half. This event occurs approximately every four years, and according to NiceHash\u2019s countdown, the next one will occur in just over 32 hours. Bitcoin miners earn revenue from two sources: transaction fees and block rewards. Historically, the former has been quite low on the BTC network, so the miners primarily depend on the latter to pay off their running costs. Since the block rewards are cut in half during Halvings, these events naturally deal a significant blow to the miner\u2019s revenues. As such, it\u2019s not surprising that the miners have generally shown a reaction to the event in the past cycles. \u201cOne of the common dynamics that occur in every cycle of cutting the issuance of new BTC is the significant selling pressure exerted by miners,\u201d says the quant. One way to gauge the degree of selling pressure coming from these chain validators is via the Miner to Exchange Flow metric. This indicator tracks the total amount of Bitcoin moving from miner-associated addresses to wallets connected to centralized exchanges. As miners usually deposit Bitcoin to these platforms for selling, this flow can provide hints about their selling behavior. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) BTC Miner to Exchange Flow over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow had surged to high levels in the 2020 Halving event, implying that this group had potentially been participating in a selloff. This selling push may have come from the miners planning to exit, given the sharp revenue reduction that was set to occur. The graph, though, clearly shows that no such selling pressure has emerged this time around despite the event being just around the corner. So, what\u2019s going on here? The analyst suggests that the Bitcoin miners may have already completed the latest round of selling in advance (as the exchange inflows from the cohort did spike in February). If this is true, the quant thinks this could benefit the market in the short term. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move sideways inside a range recently, as its price is still trading around $63,500.","article_summary":"On-chain data shows Bitcoin miners have always sold as Halvings have occurred.

This price action has been unexpected and shows how the coin tends to go against predictions, basically charting its path. Bitcoin Breaking The Mold In light of Bitcoin\u2019s randomness, especially in the past few months following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one analyst expects the coin to continue defying expectations by clocking in a bull run that defies historical trends. The analyst cites two recent instances where Bitcoin defied expectations to justify this bullish outlook. First, following the rapid expansion in the 2020 to 2021 bull run that saw Bitcoin soar from less than $10,000 to fresh all-time highs of around $70,000, prices sharply contracted in 2022. Then, the United States Federal Reserve shifted its monetary policy to curb raging inflation by rapidly increasing interest rates. Following this and other market-related events, Bitcoin prices dipped below the all-time high of the previous cycle of $20,000. By November 2022, prices fell to as low as $15,000, accelerated by the collapse of FTX. This retest of previous highs and fall below $20,000 had never happened before. Another anomaly occurred last month. For the first time, Bitcoin prices expanded and broke the previous all-time highs of around $70,000 before the Halving event. As Bitcoin\u2019s past price action shows, prices only rally to fresh all-time highs after Halving. However, this changed when BTC soared to $73,800, possibly paving the way for bulls to join in and push the coin back to unchartered territory post-Halving. Is BTC Ready For A Multi-Year Rally? With this in mind, the analyst believes Bitcoin will continue uniquely shaping its path, deviating from history. For instance, the analyst thinks BTC will outperform altcoins in the coming months. The analyst adds that increased regulatory scrutiny following high-profile collapses like FTX and Luna could dampen altcoin enthusiasm. The coin will ride on the fact that it is the only one with an ETF from the United States SEC receiving investments. As a result of this capital injection, Bitcoin will likely register a multi-year \u201cup only\u201d phase, just like gold did once its ETF was approved. Prices remain depressed ahead of this.

Chainlink 30-Day MVRV Ratio Has Plunged In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the latest trend in Chainlink\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio. The \u201cMarket Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio\u201d is a popular on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between LINK\u2019s market cap and realized cap. The market cap naturally refers to the total valuation of the asset\u2019s circulating supply at the current spot price. In contrast, the realized cap is a different type of capitalization model that calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by instead taking the price at which each coin in circulation last moved on the network as its \u201ctrue\u201d value. Since the last transaction of any coin was probably the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would signify its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of every coin in circulation. In this view, the realized cap would be nothing but a measure of the total capital the investors have used to purchase the asset. In contrast, the market cap represents the value that they are holding right now. The MVRV ratio compares these two models, and its value can provide hints about whether the overall market holds more or less than it puts into Chainlink. In the context of the current topic, the 30-day version of this indicator is of focus, which restricts itself to only the investors who bought within the past month. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this LINK indicator over the past couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink 30-day MVRV ratio has recently taken a sharp plunge and dipped under the 0% mark. The 0% mark is where the market cap and realized cap are exactly equal, so below it, the latter would be greater than the former. When this is the case, the investors are carrying losses. This recent plunge into the negative has naturally come for the metric as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has plummeted, putting the 30-day buyers underwater. In the chart, Ali has highlighted a specific pattern that Chainlink appears to have followed regarding this indicator, plunging deep into the negative territory. \u201cEach time Chainlink MVRV 30-Day Ratio has dropped below -12.24% since August 2022, it\u2019s signaled a prime buying opportunity, averaging 50% returns!\u201d notes the analyst. Recently, the indicator has declined towards 17.54%, meaning it\u2019s below this level, which has historically led to profitable buying windows for the coin. It remains to be seen whether the pattern followed in the last two years will hold this time as well. LINK Price The past week has been terrible for Chainlink investors.

This unexpected profitability has raised questions about how a blockchain like Ethereum can be profitable. Ethereum Revenue Potential As noted in a recent analysis by the on-chain data platform Token Termina, the collection of transaction fees is a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s business model. All network users are required to pay fees in ETH when interacting with applications on the blockchain, which serves as an important source of revenue for Ethereum. Once transaction fees are paid, a portion of the ETH is burned and permanently removed from circulation. This process, commonly referred to as \u201cETH buyback,\u201d benefits existing ETH holders, as the reduction in supply increases the scarcity and value of the remaining ETH tokens. Thus, the daily burning of ETH contributes to the economic benefit of those holding Ethereum. In contrast to the burning of ETH, Ethereum also issues new ETH tokens as rewards to the network\u2019s validators for each new block added to the blockchain. These rewards are similar to traditional stock-based compensation and are designed to incentivize validators to secure and maintain the network\u2019s integrity. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that the issuance of new ETH tokens dilutes the holdings of existing ETH holders. According to Token Terminal, the difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders, essentially the Ethereum blockchain owners. This calculation allows for the determination of Ethereum\u2019s profitability on a day-to-day basis. Reduced Transaction Costs Drive $3.3 Billion Growth In addition to the overhauled revenue model implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, the launch of the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem at the end of the first quarter of 2024 brought significant changes, including the introduction of a revolutionary data storage system called blobs. This upgrade has reduced congestion on the Ethereum network and significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum (ABR), Polygon (MATIC), and Coinbase\u2019s Base. Implementing the Dencun upgrade, alongside the adoption of blobs and Layer 2 networks, has significantly impacted Ethereum\u2019s revenue. According to Token Terminal data, the blockchain\u2019s revenue has witnessed an 18% annualized increase, amounting to an impressive $3.3 billion. These revenue gains can be attributed to reduced transaction costs, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for users and developers. Despite the positive revenue growth, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of market corrections and dampened investor interest in the second quarter of 2024. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s revenue has declined by over 52%. This downturn can be attributed to the broader market dynamics and the temporary decrease in investor enthusiasm. Examining the data over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s market cap (fully diluted) has decreased by 15.2% to $358.47 billion. Similarly, the circulating market cap has declined by 15.2% to reach the same value. Additionally, the token trading volume over the past 30 days has declined 18.6%, totaling $586.14 billion. ETH is trading at $3,042, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether these changes and the reduction in fees will have the same effect in the second quarter of the year, and how this, coupled with a potential increase in trading volume, can push the ETH price to higher levels.

Based on Trend Rider\u2019s analysis, Cardano could rise to as high as $3 when this happens. Cardano To Rise To $3 If History Repeats Itself Trend Rider mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that if history repeats itself, Cardano might be on the brink of its \u201cultimate support test\u201d before it makes a parabolic move to the upside.

Ripple CEO Unveils 3-Year Growth Plan When inquired about the company\u2019s growth story for the next three years, Garlinghouse began by underscoring Ripple\u2019s significant international presence, with approximately 95% of its customer base located outside the US. \u201c95% of our customers are non US financial institutions,\u201d he stated. Furthermore, Garlinghouse explained that Ripple is selling payment solutions and custody solutions around blockchain and crypto. He emphasized the company\u2019s core offerings and conveyed a strong commitment to further expansion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep expanding, even though the US market, as we were talking about earlier, partly from a regulatory point of view, has been slow to adopt, the non-US market has been really, really strong for us. And we\u2019re going to be the infrastructure around all of that. That is our goal, and we think that opportunity is huge. We think that\u2019s going to be great for Ripple,\u201d Garlinghouse noted. In addition to infrastructure, Ripple plans to enhance the utility of XRP, the digital asset central to its payment protocol. Garlinghouse expressed a positive outlook for XRP, linking its success to Ripple\u2019s expansion and the broader adoption of its technologies. \u201cWe think that\u2019s going to be great for Ripple. We think it\u2019s going to be great for XRP,\u201d he said, reinforcing the symbiotic relationship between Ripple\u2019s growth and the adoption of its associated cryptocurrency. Garlinghouse then delved into the specifics of the upcoming US dollar-backed stablecoin, a pivotal development in Ripple\u2019s strategy to bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning sector of cryptocurrencies. He described the stablecoin as a response to the escalating demand within the stablecoin market, currently valued at $150 billion and potentially rising to over $2 trillion. \u201cRipple has always been about how do we bridge this new world with a traditional kind of, people call it TradFi, traditional finance,\u201d he explained. This stablecoin aims to provide a reliable and regulatory-compliant option in contrast to competitors like Tether, which is based outside of the US and faces different regulatory scrutiny. The initiative represents a strategic move to position Ripple as a leader in compliant, secure, and user-friendly crypto-finance solutions. \u201cI think that market is going to grow a lot. I think a US-based player who is compliance first has a great role to play,\u201d Garlinghouse added. Regulatory Environment And Advocacy For Clear Guidelines Garlinghouse also delved into the regulatory environment in the US, critiquing the slow pace of legislative progress which he believes hampers market growth. \u201cWashington is still trying to understand this market,\u201d he commented, expressing concern over potential legislation that might place undue barriers on the burgeoning crypto market. He was particularly critical of the current administration and regulatory figures, stating, \u201cThis administration, I think, has taken a pretty anti-crypto stance led by the SEC Gary Gensler as the chair has really doesn\u2019t understand it.\u201d He also challenged the narrative put forth by certain politicians, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who he quoted as saying, \u201cThe only people using crypto are bad actors.\u201d Garlinghouse concluded with a call to action for more informed, pro-innovation policies that align with fostering job creation and economic growth, reminiscent of the early days of the internet boom in Silicon Valley. \u201cThis is about leading the next wave of innovation,\u201d he affirmed, urging US policymakers to embrace and facilitate the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrency through clear and supportive regulations. Via X, he added: How pro-innovation policies in the US will prevail. Step 1 \u2013 replace the SEC leadership and step 2 \u2013 Elizabeth Warren\u2019s staff should read some actual facts on crypto instead of spewing constant misinformation.

According to prosecutors, Eisenberg, operating under a false identity, allegedly engaged in market manipulation to drive up the price of Mango\u2019s token, MNGO, and related contracts, ultimately exploiting an exchange feature to withdraw $110 million in cryptocurrency with no intention of repayment. Avi Eisenberg\u2019s Manipulation Scheme Exposed During the trial, prosecutors revealed that Eisenberg manipulated the price of MNGO tokens to deceive the system and acquire illicit funds. By \u201cartificially inflating\u201d the token\u2019s value, Eisenberg allegedly sought to perpetrate a deliberate fraud against Mango Markets. Assistant US Attorney Thomas Burnett emphasized Eisenberg\u2019s intent to \u201ctake the money and run,\u201d alleging that he meticulously planned and executed the fraud. Shortly after his significant financial gain, Eisenberg fled to Israel from Puerto Rico, where he resided. However, upon his return to Puerto Rico on December 26, 2022, US authorities arrested him. Eisenberg has remained in custody since then, as a judge deemed him a flight risk ahead of his trial. Prosecution Clash In Mango Markets\u2019 Fraud Trial During the trial, Eisenberg\u2019s defense attorney, Brian Klein, argued that his client had executed a legal trading strategy within the exchange\u2019s rules. Klein contended that Eisenberg had taken calculated risks within the confines of the smart contracts governing the decentralized finance platform. Furthermore, he highlighted the platform\u2019s disclaimer that warned users of the software\u2019s unaudited nature and associated risks. Assistant US Attorney Thomas Burnett countered the defense\u2019s argument, stating that the rules of the Mango Markets platform did not shield Eisenberg from prosecution for fraud and manipulation. Eisenberg did not testify during the trial, but he played an active role in his defense, taking notes throughout the testimony and frequently suggesting questions for his attorneys to ask the witnesses. Following Eisenberg\u2019s conviction, the price of the MNGO token has experienced a notable surge, reaching $0.029. This represents a notable 11.5% increase within the past 24 hours alone. In broader timeframes, contrasting the performance of the overall cryptocurrency market, MNGO has demonstrated significant gains of 69% and 46% over the past fourteen and thirty days, respectively. These figures indicate a renewed interest in the token after the exploit of the Mango Markets protocol. However, despite these recent gains, the MNGO token remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.49, achieved in September 2021. The current price reflects a decline of 94% from that peak level.

Here\u2019s what the whales are doing while the market panics. How The Bitcoin Whales Are Behaving At The Moment In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed how the Bitcoin whales have been behaving recently, given the struggle the asset\u2019s price has been going through. Whales popularly refer to BTC investors carrying at least 1,000 tokens in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth about $63.5 million. Due to this massive scale of holdings, the whales can influence the network. Thus, their behavior can naturally be worth following. First, the analytics firm has discussed the largest entities, even among the whales: the \u201cLarge Holders.\u201d IntoTheBlock categorizes Large Holders as those who own 0.1% or more of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply. Currently, almost 19.7 million tokens are in circulation, so these large holders would be those holding around 19,700 BTC, which is worth a whopping $1.25 billion. To track the behavior of the large holders, the analytics firm has referred to its \u201cLarge Holders Netflow\u201d metric, which uses on-chain data to track the net amount of BTC entering into or exiting the wallets of these humongous entities. Below is the chart for the indicator that shows how its value has changed over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Large Holders Netflow observed some notable positive spikes during March, suggesting that these massive investors had participated in the accumulation. The metric\u2019s value has recently stayed near the neutral level, with neither distribution nor accumulation showing any particular dominance. This would mean that the latest price drawdown hasn\u2019t been an enticing buy-the-dip opportunity for this cohort yet. The whales, though, have been buying at these recent low prices. The chart below shows the combined balance held by members of this group. As the graph shows, the Bitcoin whales made notable selling moves as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price rose to a new all-time high (ATH) last month. Following Bitcoin\u2019s drawdown from this ATH, though, the whales started buying again. As prices have gone lower recently, they have ramped up their rate of accumulation. IntoTheBlock said these investors had bought 16,300 BTC (almost $1.04 billion) over the past week. Overall, the fact that the whales are accumulating while the large holders have at least not been selling anything significant can perhaps provide a neutral to slightly bullish picture for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,400, down 10% over the past week.","article_summary":"Bitcoin has continued to struggle recently, and its price even briefly fell below $60,000.

Unlike the pre-halving sell-offs witnessed before the Halvings of 2016 and 2020, miners accumulate, going against previous trends. Miners Accumulating Bitcoin In a post on X, one analyst, while citing CryptoQuant data, notes that since the beginning of 2024, the total BTC balance held by miners has grown by a staggering 12,100 BTC, reaching a total of 217,000 BTC. This behavior starkly contrasts with what happened in 2016 and 2020 before the network slashed miner rewards. Then, reading from data, most miners were sizing down their holdings in anticipation of possible revenue slumps post-Halving. Halving is set at the protocol level and slashes miner block rewards by half, currently from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This way, miners would have to expend more resources to generate the same revenue they would have in the previous epoch. Accordingly, some small miners tend to liquidate and exit in anticipation of the rising competition. However, some large miners with more resources would take the opportunity to sell coins and buy more efficient miners to stay competitive. From the chart, miners continued offloading their BTC post-halving in 2016. However, even with increasing selling pressure, prices rose sharply in 2017, peaking at $20,000 before cooling off in 2018. As Bitcoin and crypto found adoption following the ICO mania of 2017, the scene became more liquid, and more miners participated, as seen from the rising hash rate post-halving. Unlike events in 2016, the 2020 halving marked a turning point. As Bitcoin prices skyrocketed towards record highs, miners adopted a holding strategy, rapidly accumulating coins, as the chart shows. This current accumulation trend suggests miners may anticipate a similar price surge. Is BTC Ready For A Bull Run To $100,000? This shift in miner behavior could positively impact prices. Miners, expected to readjust and become more efficient after April 19, are holding a vote of confidence even amid the current slump. Overall, a reduction in daily BTC emissions post-Halving, coupled with miners accumulating and institutions pouring in via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could propel prices even higher. The pace at which prices rise is yet to be seen. Bitcoin is bearish and remains under immense selling pressure following losses on April 13. A bullish breakout above the current range of $74,000 might be the base for more gains towards $100,000.","article_summary":"As the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event approaches on April 19, a fascinating trend is emerging among miners.

The arrests were made following an investigation into suspicious activities involving \u201cabnormally frequent\u201d and large transactions in bank accounts lacking tax records, import and export declarations, and physical addresses. Suspects Allegedly Used Tether During the probe, it was discovered that one of the accounts involved received significant daily deposits of up to HK$39 million ($4.9 million) and facilitated 167 transactions. Further examination revealed that two suspects allegedly handled HK$760 million, equivalent to 40% of the total funds, through a cryptocurrency platform, specifically Tether. Florence Yeung Yee-tak, commander of the Financial Investigation Division of the Customs Department, cited alleged challenges in investigating money laundering related to cryptocurrencies due to their anonymity and \u201clack of jurisdictional restrictions.\u201d Yee-tak emphasized that the enforcement team relied on intelligence, capital flow analysis, and financial investigations to gather evidence. In a coordinated operation, customs officers targeted four residences, five companies, and two licensed money service businesses before making the arrests. Trio Arrested For Laundering Billions In Crypto The trio, consisting of a 42-year-old woman and two men aged 48 and 60, allegedly set up five companies and opened 18 local bank accounts between June 2021 and July 2022. These companies were reportedly involved in over 1,000 suspicious transactions, receiving funds from undisclosed sources. Notably, the three arrested suspects did not know each other. The unemployed woman allegedly played a key role in the money laundering, receiving transfers from various companies and crypto exchanges. The funds were transferred to other companies or to the two male suspects through licensed money changers. According to the Customs and Excise Department, the woman managed HK$900 million of the illicit funds, while the 60-year-old driver handled HK$300 million, and the self-employed man dealt with HK$600 million. Investigations have revealed that the funds originated from a crypto exchange platform and over 200 local and overseas companies. The funds were rapidly transferred to other entities once deposited into the shell companies\u2019 bank accounts. The shell companies purportedly operated in mobile phone accessories, wholesale machinery, and vehicle parts. However, they engaged in business transactions unrelated to their stated sectors, including agricultural products and food, indicating their role as shell companies. The operation, code-named \u201cRacer,\u201d resulted in the seizure of mobile phones, company documents, stamps, and transaction records. Customs confirmed that the source and destination of the funds are still being investigated. Although the core members of the syndicate are believed to have been apprehended, customs authorities have not ruled out the possibility of further arrests. The three suspects were arrested on charges of conspiracy to deal with proceeds of an indictable offense, commonly known as money laundering. They have been released on bail but could face a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a HK$5 million fine if convicted.

Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses Have Aggressively Bought The Dip As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out, the total Bitcoin inflows going towards the accumulation addresses have set a new all-time high recently. The \u201caccumulation addresses\u201d here refer to wallets that have only a history of receiving transactions and never of sending. This means that these addresses have only purchased coins and have never participated in any selling. Besides this definition, fewer other restrictions exist for an address to be considered a part of this group. The wallet should have received at least two transfers (as only one transaction wouldn\u2019t be enough to set the trend one way or another), and its balance should be greater than 10 BTC. Even if they satisfy these conditions, miners and exchange-associated wallets are still excluded from the group, as they inherently compensate for the sell-side of cryptocurrency. The accumulation addresses are naturally the opposite of these entities, as these HODLers buy coins and lock them up in their relentless hands, thus effectively removing them from the circulating supply. There is also one final condition for an address to fall in this category: it must have seen its most recent transfer within the last seven years. Wallets older than this are thought to be lost because of missing keys or just being forgotten, so they don\u2019t exactly represent the voluntary HODLers of the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows going toward these accumulation addresses over the past year: As the above graph shows, Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses have recently achieved a new record. In this spike, 27,700 BTC ($1.75 billion at the current exchange rate) have flowed into the wallets of these perennial HODLers in a single day. The indicator\u2019s previous all-time high was witnessed a couple of months ago when the accumulation addresses purchased 25,100 BTC (almost $1.6 billion). The chart shows that this buying spree occurred during the rally, eventually resulting in BTC touching new highs. As such, the latest strong accumulation from these diamond hands may also be bullish for the asset\u2019s price. The chart also shows that the frequency and scale of large purchases from this cohort have been quite extraordinary in recent months. This trend could be explained by the bullish environment following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and their buying.

On-chain data shows an accumulation trend from this whale, with the latest being the acquisition of 300 million DOGE tokens worth $45 million at the current market price. These speculations have led to theories on who the whale buyer might be amidst a continued price decline for Dogecoin, with the most prominent hypothesis being billionaire Elon Musk. Whale Accumulating Dogecoin Dogecoin is currently on an extended price decline, with its price now down by 25.8% in the past seven days. However, on-chain data shows that a particular whale has been buying the dip, which is a testament to their strong belief in the cryptocurrency. Whale Alerts, a crypto whale transaction tracker, noted a DOGE accumulation from crypto exchange Robinhood into the private wallet \u201cDDuXGM\u201d amidst a flurry of other whale transactions in other cryptocurrencies. The transaction involved the movement of 150 million DOGE worth $23.5 million from Robinhood into the unknown wallet. It is interesting to note that a further investigation into the whale\u2019s on-chain activities reveals that this was not a one-time buy. The whale had acquired another 150 million and 30 million DOGE tokens worth $23.1 million and $4.8 million respectively in the hours before the last purchase. Elon Musk\u2019s tweets in the hours leading up to the purchase have only fueled speculation that he may be the whale. Just hours before, the billionaire tweeted a meme picture mentioning Dogecoin, which led to some speculations among investors. Musk has been a vocal proponent of Dogecoin for months, and his tweets are known to cause spikes in the price of DOGE. However, it is important to note that his recent tweet failed to do many wonders for the price of DOGE as the crypto continued on its month-lasting correction. At this point, there are more questions than answers about the mysterious $46 million Dogecoin purchase. Was it indeed Elon Musk or another whale quietly accumulating DOGE? At the time of writing, this whale address \u201cDDuXGM\u201d is holding 2.478 billion DOGE tokens worth $363.6 million. According to MartyParty, a prominent crypto influencer, the accumulation could be in response to a recent announcement from BITMAIN, a company producing crypto mining equipment. BITMAIN recently revealed its plans to expand support for DOGE mining after its Antiminer L9 release in May. Bitmain\u2019s Antiminer L9 model will support mining operations for Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bells (BEL), which are some of the still-existing proof-of-work blockchains. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.144, down by 8.15% in the past 24 hours. The significant price correction in the last day means Dogecoin is now in red in a monthly timeframe, and it is now down by 4.55% in the past 30 days.","article_summary":"Dogecoin is grabbing headlines and speculation from its wide community of investors after a recent whale accumulation from a crypto exchange.

This shift from its foundational principles could redefine Bitcoin\u2019s role in the financial landscape. One Huge Mining Powerhouse Since its inception by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin has been celebrated as a pioneering force for financial autonomy and freedom, free from the control of centralized financial institutions. However, recent developments suggest a departure from this ideal, steering Bitcoin towards what Stadelmann terms a \u201ccentralized paradox.\u201d One of the most significant indicators of this trend is the concentration of mining power within a handful of mining pools. Foundry USA and Antpool, for example, now control over 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total hashrate. This concentration is even more pronounced when considering that more than 80% of mining power is held by just five pools. Such dominance by a few undermines the decentralized nature that Bitcoin was supposed to exemplify. Distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s Network Hashrate. Source: Statista The influence of government and regulatory bodies also complicates the picture. For instance, North America\u2019s Blockseer pool not only meets but exceeds the US Government\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance standards. Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks? This compliance introduces a level of government oversight and control that was previously absent, diluting the decentralized promise of Bitcoin. \u201cIn short, a minority of miners control substantial resources, undermining the decentralized ethos that Bitcoin claims to uphold. This scenario questions the egalitarian nature that Bitcoin was purported to represent and opens discussions about the true beneficiaries of this digital currency,\u201d Stadelmann told BeInCrypto. American Institutions Take Over Stadelmann also believes that the growing engagement of major financial institutions in Bitcoin mining operations signals another shift towards centralization. BlackRock has acquired significant shares in two leading Bitcoin mining companies, 6.71% in Marathon Digital Holdings and 6.61% in Riot Blockchain, with investments nearing $383 million. Since 2014, Fidelity Group has been actively mining Bitcoin. On the other hand, Vanguard holds roughly 17.9 million shares in Riot Platforms and 17.5 million shares in Marathon Digital. This is not just about financial investment. In January, BlackRock further integrated Bitcoin into the mainstream financial market by filing documents with the SEC to include a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This new financial instrument now manages 272,800 BTC, valued at $17.20 billion. This figure does not even include holdings from similar products managed by other entities. \u201cThe increasing influence of these financial giants in Bitcoin mining operations could lead to a scenario where the decision-making and control over the network become concentrated in the hands of a few, rather than being distributed among a diverse group of participants,\u201d Stadelmann added. Bitcoin ETF Historical Holdings. Source: CryptoQuant The core of the problem lies in the stark contrast between Bitcoin\u2019s current trajectory and its original purpose. Bitcoin\u2019s original vision was to operate as a decentralized network, independent of traditional financial systems. However, increasing centralization might draw it closer to the very systems it aimed to circumvent.

Santiment Explains","author":"Bary Rahma","article_detailed_content":"In the days leading up to the Bitcoin halving, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant downturn, raising concerns about a potential bear market. Bitcoin saw a notable 19% price drop, while altcoins faced even steeper declines, with some plummeting by as much as 70%. This trend has sparked a debate among investors about the immediate future of cryptocurrencies as the halving approaches. Bitcoin and Altcoins Nosedive Before the Halving Historically, the Bitcoin halving \u2014 a scheduled reduction in the reward for mining new blocks \u2014 has been a catalyst for bullish market sentiment. The event effectively slashes the supply of new BTC, which in theory should increase the price if demand remains constant. However, Garry Kabankin, Market Analyst at Santiment, told BeInCrypto that the market does not operate solely on fundamentals, particularly in periods surrounding such significant events. The recent price corrections in Bitcoin and altcoins may reflect a natural market response to speculative anticipation, rather than fundamental declines in value. Indeed, the current market scenario reflects a speculative trading environment leading up to the halving. \u201cThe steep drop in altcoins, even more so than Bitcoin, underscores the heightened volatility and speculative trading that can precede such events. It\u2019s a reminder of the market\u2019s sensitivity to supply dynamics changes, where the reduced block reward post-halving can lead to expectations of decreased supply pressure,\u201d Kabankin explained. Kabankin explains that observing miner behavior, such as changes in miners\u2019 balance and total supply, can provide further insights. A decrease in miners selling their holdings pre-halving could suggest a bullish outlook, expecting higher prices post-event. Nevertheless, the true impact of the halving will only become clear in the weeks following. As the market adjusts to the new supply rate, its implications for Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and value can be understood.

Essentially, anticipation leads to speculative runs followed by corrections. However, Kabankin points out that given the current on-chain metrics and social sentiment, a nuanced view is necessary. \u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve seen euphoria around halvings, often leading to a reevaluation of positions post-event. It\u2019s crucial to monitor social sentiment and whale behavior for more immediate signs of market directio,\u201d Kabankin added. Moreover, the Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) ratio offers a clear view of market sentiment. It indicates whether the asset is over or undervalued at any given time. According to Kabankin, investors should also closely monitor the mean coin age. Significant drops can signal increased movement and potential selling pressure, hinting at broader market shifts. These indicators, combined with traditional support levels from technical analysis, can guide investors through uncertain times. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio. Source: Santiment Kabankin believes that to spot the potential resumption of a bull run, investors should pay attention to a blend of social sentiment and on-chain metrics. A decrease in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) coupled with an increase in fear of missing out (FOMO), often precedes market upswings. Furthermore, a significant uptick in stablecoin supply moving onto exchanges can signal readiness for buying action, hinting at bullish sentiment. Also, an increase in trading volume can indicate growing support for the trend. It may suggest a healthier buildup to a bull run. \u201cLooking at resistance barriers and on-chain signals is crucial for spotting potential turnarounds. One key metric to watch is the Mean Dollar Invested Age, especially when it starts decreasing, which can indicate that previously dormant tokens are moving, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment,\u201d Kabankin emphasized.

This move indicates Tether\u2019s intent to broaden its influence and diversify beyond its core stablecoin operations. Tether\u2019s New Focus on Tech and Education With its new framework, Tether is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. The Tether Data division will concentrate on strategic investments in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. Its partnerships with companies like Holepunch and investments in Northern Data Group highlight this focus on innovation. Simultaneously, Tether Finance will remain the hub for Tether\u2019s existing stablecoin products and financial services. The division aims to utilize blockchain technology to make global financial systems more inclusive. Moreover, its upcoming digital asset tokenization platform could play a role in wider digital asset adoption.

Tether Edu supports global access to digital skills, focusing on blockchain and P2P technologies. Its key initiatives include public-private partnerships and investments like Lugano\u2019s Plan B and the Academy of Digital Industries. Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, emphasized the company\u2019s innovative ethos in a recent statement. \u201cWith this evolution beyond our traditional stablecoin offerings, we are ready to build and support the invention and implementation of cutting-edge technology that removes the limitations of what\u2019s possible in this world,\u201d Ardoino said. This announcement comes when the regulatory environment for stablecoins is becoming more intricate. US senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand have recently proposed new legislation regulating stablecoins. The proposed bill, set for discussion in Congress next month, seeks to enhance consumer protection and preserve the integrity of the US dollar in digital finance. \u201cIt protects consumers by mandating one-to-one reserves, prohibiting algorithmic stablecoins, and requiring stablecoin issuers to comply with US anti-money laundering and sanctions rules,\u201d Senator Gillibrand remarked. Although Tether\u2019s stablecoin is not algorithmic, there are some allegations and concerns that USDT is being used for illicit activities, such as terrorism financing. USDT, being the biggest fish in the pond, frequently invites regulatory scrutiny. Read more: What Are Algorithmic Stablecoins? Stablecoin Market Dominance.

Although significant, it remains relatively mild by crypto standards. However, a more significant downturn would occur if the market descends to the golden ratio support level of around $1.45 trillion, essentially halving its value. Market Down 23% and Falling \u2013 What\u2019s Next? The cryptocurrency market has corrected approximately 23% thus far, breaching key support levels such as the 50-day EMA and the .382 Fib support at around $2.237 trillion. This development suggests the possibility of a further correction towards the next Fibonacci support zone, ranging between approximately $1.9 trillion and $1.96 trillion. A bullish rebound could occur upon reaching this support level, signaling a resumption of the upward trend. Alternatively, if the market continues to decline, the next significant support is expected around the 200-day EMA at approximately $1.856 trillion. Regarding indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram in the daily chart displays a bearish trend with downward ticks, accompanied by the bearish crossing of the MACD lines. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in neutral territory, providing no clear bullish or bearish signals.

A descent to the subsequent Fibonacci support level suggests a downside potential of approximately 11.6%, indicating a possible decline of more than 10% once again for the crypto market. This scenario could prompt altcoins to undergo a more pronounced correction. Moreover, the MACD lines are on the verge of forming a bearish crossover, while the MACD histogram has displayed bearish trends for three weeks. Crypto Market Cap chart.

Runes will go live after Bitcoin completes halving. This new framework enables the creation of altcoins directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature was once exclusive to networks like Ethereum and Solana. Runes Anticipation Spike Up Bitcoin Transaction Fees The buzz around Runes stems from the success of Rodarmor\u2019s previous project, the Ordinals protocol. Ordinals introduced NFT-like \u201cinscriptions\u201d to Bitcoin, infusing innovation and increased mining revenue into the community. However, this led to network congestion and higher transaction fees. As the launch approaches, its effects are already noticeable, with transaction fees on the Bitcoin network increasing dramatically. Fees have surged by over 45% in just one day and a staggering 892.7% compared to last year. This rise highlights the growing excitement and activity around the new protocol.

Bitcoin entrepreneur Dan Held describes this method as a \u201csimple strict improvement over BRC-20.\u201d \u201cRunes operations do not create a leftover useless UTXO. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that the market doesn\u2019t particularly care about technical improvements so I\u2019m glad that the market is hyped about Runes even if it\u2019s for speculative reasons and hopefully it results in a general improvement on the network,\u201d Held wrote. However, Runes also marks a major cultural shift within Bitcoin. Traditionally, Bitcoin has focused on its native cryptocurrency. Runes disrupt this by enabling the proliferation of various speculative altcoins on Bitcoin. Yet, the short-term success of Runes and its tokens is under scrutiny. Some analysts predict initial enthusiasm similar to the NFT boom, but concerns about sustained interest and value remain. DeFi researcher Ignas warns that real investment opportunities may only appear after the initial hype cools down. Ignas explains that the influx of Rune tokens could initially dilute trader attention and investment per token, potentially causing their novelty and value to diminish quickly.

The prohibition is not surprising, given China\u2019s restrictive stance on cryptocurrencies. Since the 2021 ban on trading and mining cryptocurrencies, Chinese traders have faced significant hurdles in accessing global crypto markets.

This follows after two high-ranking lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday to discuss the way forward. According to the initial report by Punchbowl News, the meeting was held in Schumer\u2019s office, shortly after the Japanese prime minister jointly addressed Congress the same day. Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters Keen on Stablecoin Reform Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have, so far, been very consistent in their bid to see the committee\u2019s stablecoin bill passed into law. So much so that their efforts played a huge part in the bill\u2019s passing at the House committee, albeit with a bipartisan vote. However, not much progress has been made since that passing, therefore blurring any hopes that the bill may be passed into law this year. First off, getting a floor vote in a House where there is ongoing infighting, especially among top Republicans, would be a difficult task. Also, the Senate Banking Committee hasn\u2019t lent any support or has shown any interest in the idea up until now. Despite these potential setbacks, however, McHenry and Waters are not willing to give up just yet. According to sources familiar with what was discussed on Thursday, the duo is looking to tie the stablecoin bill to a must-move item, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending bill. For McHenry, getting his panel\u2019s stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign into law is one of his priorities before retiring from Congress later this year. With Schumer now in the picture, there is a glimmer of hope that legislation that will guide issuers of stablecoins may just see the light of day. As of publication, efforts to reach out to McHenry and Waters for commentary have not yet yielded any results. Call for Cooperation Meanwhile, the meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a wake-up call for lawmakers around the world. It is an encouragement for them to double their efforts in advancing the stablecoin reform agenda. However, as the debate surrounding stablecoin regulation continues to gain traction, it will all boil down to the collective resolve of lawmakers to address regulatory uncertainties for this fast-evolving digital economy to attain success in the future. next US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform","article_summary":"Coinspeaker US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform Reps.

Throughout this week, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has shown strong volatility as we stare at Friday\u2019s Bitcoin options expiry. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6% up on the weekly chart at $70,922 with a market cap of $1.4 trillion. As per data from Greeks.live, a staggering 21,000 Bitcoin options are set to expire having a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put call ratio of 0.62. The max pain point for the expiry currently stands at $69,000. With the US CPI data and inflation coming higher than expected, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced stronger volatility. On the other hand, the implied volatility has declined which means that in the case of volatile price movements, the BTC price can tank further under $70,000. Furthermore, the Greeks.live data shows that the sell calls have dominated the Bitcoin trade over the past month and the optimism around Bitcoin halving seems to be waning. Also, with the slowdown in the Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC lacks enough impetus to continue with its rally ahead. As of now, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been largely consolidating in a tight range between $69,000-$71,000. Analysts believe that it could continue to consolidate up to halving without showing any major price movements. #BTC is still just consolidating between these two levels No major trend shift as we approach the Bitcoin Halving$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3nYdfEN9Sd pic.twitter.com/iaAQn27Tuj \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 11, 2024 Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $71,000 Over the last fortnight, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has faced a significant struggle moving past $71,000, clearly hinting at a strong bearish grip in the market. Critics speculate that the S&P 500\u2019s recent decline from its peak of 5265 on March 28 could foreshadow an economic downturn. Given Bitcoin\u2019s strong correlation with stocks, which surpassed 80% last month, its price might initially decline if market troubles persist. On the other hand, the BTC futures market continues to show signs of neutrality highlighting a healthy demand for leverage calls in comparison to the situation in March-end. However, any kind of excessive leverage remains a valid concern with the Bitcoin futures open interest currently standing at $34.3 billion. ⌛️🗣️ As #Bitcoin has now drawn to its final week before the #halving, social dominance toward the topic has peaked at its highest level of the year at 9pm UTC.

According to the report, the number of financing in the digital asset space increased by 50% in March to reach $1.6 million compared to February. The month witnessed a resurgence in institutional investments, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s climb to a new all-time high above $73,000 after a two-year downturn. Pushed by positive market sentiments, investors directed funds into 180 crypto projects across various sectors. Market Dynamics and Investment Trends The KuCoin research found a continuous growth trend in both the number and scale of investment and financing projects compared to the previous year. The company said the growth signals a robust revival in the primary investment market within the current crypto economy. While the financing scale between $10 and $100 million notably increased from 16.6% in February to 28.81% in March, seed-stage financing projects saw a slight decline from 40.86% to 37.8%. Despite this increase, strategic stage financing projects surged to 22.83% from 16.13%. Blockchain Performance and Investor Focus In terms of blockchain performance, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Polygon (MATIC) projects attracted substantial investor attention, especially following Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions after the Dencun upgrade. While Bitcoin and Polygon remained strong, Ethereum, through its layer-2 scaling solutions, topped the chart after the Dencun upgrade. For active venture capital companies participating in the crypto industry, OKX Ventures leads the way, emerging as the leader among other investors. The company participated in a total of 20 projects in March, followed by MH and Waterdrip. When it comes to the top ten sectors that received significant attention from venture capital, key sectors such as Infrastructure (Infra), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Games dominated venture capital investments. In March, investment institutions favored themes revolving around AI, DEX, and Lending projects. Market Momentum and Future Outlook March showcased a bullish trend for the entire crypto market, particularly propelled by Bitcoin\u2019s surge to new heights. On March 12, Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF recorded a new historical high for single-day net inflows, reaching $1.05 billion. With the Bitcoin ETF\u2019s historical inflow, the options and futures market saw significant Open Interest (OI) growth, reflecting an increased capital influx. However, a significant delivery in the options market on March 29 caused the OI to slide.

This new feature ensures the security and fairness of crypto transactions. The implementation of this solution is a direct response to user complaints about technical issues and hacking incidents, showing the wallet\u2019s commitment to improving the overall crypto experience for its large user base. MEV Protection coincides with an upgrade to Trust Wallet\u2019s Swaps feature, which now allows seamless exchanges with over 1 million token pairs across multiple networks and providers. This dual advancement showcases its dedication to facilitating secure swaps in the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding MEV and Its Impact Miner Extractable Value is a concept in the blockchain industry that refers to the potential profit miners, validators, and other participants can gain by manipulating the order, censorship, or insertion of transactions within a block. These attacks exploit this vulnerability, enabling malicious actors to manipulate transaction orders for personal gain. They result in increased slippage, less favorable execution prices, and an unfair trading experience for regular users. MEV Protection: A Comprehensive Solution The introduction of MEV Protection is aimed at countering this attack. The security measure safeguards users\u2019 swaps from front-running and sandwich attacks, which are common tactics used by bad actors in the crypto space. Front-running involves exploiting knowledge of a pending transaction to execute a similar transaction before it, thereby manipulating the market price. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, require trapping a legitimate transaction between two malicious ones to profit from price slippage. The MEV protocol ensures that users receive fair market prices for their swaps, protecting them from the risk of paying more or receiving less than the prevailing market rate. This feature benefits both experienced traders and those new to crypto, creating a safer and more secure environment for all swap participants. Easy Access to MEV Protection Accessing this new feature is a simple process. Users can select the swap option from the bottom menu, click on the settings button in the top right corner, and enable the MEV protection features. This will also make it available on all devices connected to the account, ensuring a seamless and secure trading experience and automatically opting users in for an additional layer of security from the beginning. This approach further showcases its commitment to transparency and providing a user-focused Web3 experience. In addition, the crypto wallet further places a strong emphasis on user education and empowerment, ensuring that its community is well-informed about the security measures that it has put in place. The introduction of this new development has received praise from the Trust Wallet community. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! Congratulations on adding MEV Protection. Now we can swap with peace of mind.

The training, done as part of the firm\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility is to help bolster law enforcement\u2019s understanding of blockchain technology, particularly as Hong Kong continues its push as the new darling of the crypto economy. According to a local media source, the training sessions were conducted for the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) and Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB). Web3 Companies and Authorities Jointly Fight Crypto Crimes With the increasing prominence of Hong Kong in the cryptocurrency space, Bitrace CEO Isabel says it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between Web3 companies and the authorities. She maintains that the training is targeted at equipping law enforcement officers with the necessary skills and knowledge to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes effectively. Isabel, while delivering a comprehensive overview of crypto-assets application in cybercrime, highlighted some challenges including the fact that regulatory agencies lag behind in understanding crypto-criminal methods. Many crypto crime fighters do not also know that encrypted crime investigation is usually multi-layered, and the low efficiency of collaboration among stakeholders. The Bitrace CEO insisted that it is necessary to protect the security of users\u2019 funds and foster a healthier and safer Web3 environment by strengthening partnerships with regulatory agencies. The capacity-building sessions delved into various aspects of crypto-related crimes such as online gambling, illicit asset trading, money laundering, and fraud. Last year, Anatoly Legkodymov, the former CEO of Bitzlato, pleaded guilty to facilitating the laundering of illicit funds totaling $700 million. Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace\u2019s technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities. Real-life case studies were analyzed to provide insights into encryption crime methods and the flow of criminal funds on the blockchain. Bitrace Capabilities Beyond Hong Kong Police Training Besides the training, Bitrace also engaged in discussions with the Commercial Crimes Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau. The aim is to foster collaboration between regulatory agencies and Web3 companies. Prior to the training, the regulatory authorities have tried to keep the space sane. For instance, last month, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong had flagged suspected crypto fraud with HKCEXP to prevent users from falling victim to scams. Analysts say Bitrace is well suited to provide capacity building for Hong Kong police as it has advanced analytics capabilities, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms and has enabled the accumulation of a vast address tag library. This library includes entity tags such as DeFi platforms, mining pools, and digital asset exchanges, as well as risk behavior tags like fraud, money laundering, and illegal online gambling. Thus, by utilizing this technology, regulatory authorities can swiftly identify suspicious addresses and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto transactions. Industry watchers hope that the collaboration addresses the challenges posed by crypto-related crimes. This is paramount as the Hong Kong SFC is set to green light spot Bitcoin ETFs in the region anything from now.next Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training","article_summary":"Coinspeaker Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace's technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities.

While the outcome did not guarantee an outright ouster of the current sitting president, Yoon Suk Yeol, all indicators point to a one-term tenure ending in three years. Furthermore, the opposition\u2019s landslide victory has led to the resignation of Han Dong-hoon and Han Duck-soo as the party leader of the People Power Party (PPP) and Prime Minister respectively. Notably, South Korea\u2019s opposition parties jointly won 192 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. If the opposition parties managed to reach 200 seats, the current president would be impeached. Nonetheless, the remaining three years for the current president will be extremely difficult with the opposition controlling the National Assembly. What South Korea\u2019s Opposition Win Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets South Korea is one of the leading developed countries that have significantly adopted the web3 industry and digital assets. The high adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets in South Korea, amounting to over 6 million people, had a significant influence in the just concluded parliamentary election. Furthermore, both sides of the political aisle had promised reward packages for the cryptocurrency industry if elected in the country\u2019s National Assembly. On one side, the PPP had vowed to delay a digital asset tax and allow investors to thrive in the nascent sector. On the other hand, the Democratic Party pledged to allow South Korean investors to tap into spot Bitcoin ETFs both locally and overseas. JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea's pro-#Bitcoin Democratic Party has won the national election to form government. DP: \"We're going to allow the ETFs, domestic or overseas.\" More than 6 million South Koreans \u2014 over 10% of the population own Bitcoin or crypto. \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) April 11, 2024 Notably, the DP party will need to overhaul the country\u2019s securities regulator that previously indicated that brokering spot BTC ETFs violates the law. The arguments follow data that shows that South Korean investors purchased more than $200 million of MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR). Additionally, more investors from South Korea have been trading crypto futures ETFs. Meanwhile, it will remain a game of waiting to see if the president will bend to the National Assembly\u2019s rules and vice versa. Market Picture The cryptocurrency market remains in a macro bullish outlook with the Bitcoin halving 2024 about 9 days from happening. The fact that the United States has struggled to tame the dollar inflation is a direct reflection of the global economic situation. Furthermore, some countries led by El Salvador have been purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and global geopolitical instability. As Coinspeaker previously noted, the United States Federal Reserve only remains optimistic that interest rate cuts will take place later this year amid the upcoming general elections.

In a meeting, several state agencies called for regulating P2P crypto trading and digital asset purchases to protect people from financial loss. Thailand to Prevent Scammers from Cleaning Money via P2P Trades In attendance were representatives from several agencies, including the Defense Ministry, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, the Royal Thai Police, and the Bank of Thailand. Others were the Department of Special Investigation, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association, the Interior Ministry, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, and the Department of Special Investigation. The meeting was led by the Thai Minister for Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Jantararuangthong. The participants met following a recent order from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. The Prime Minister gave agencies 30 days to disclose plans to crack down on growing online fraud. According to a Bangkok Post publication, online scammers take the proceeds from their illicit activities and pass them through crypto exchanges and trading platforms via P2P trading. This helps to minimize the risk of being traced, making it difficult for authorities to find and prosecute scammers. According to Prasert\u2019s ministry, 80% of the 100 million baht ($2.7 million) worth of daily fraud recorded in Thailand passes through P2P channels. The ministry believes this is an easy way for fraudsters to clean the money because these fund transfers are unregulated. The Minister tasked the SEC with finding ways to regulate P2P trades to prevent money laundering. No VAT for Crypto in Thailand According to the SEC, there are 2 million crypto accounts held by individuals in Thailand. Current regulations focus on regulating crypto trading, especially targeting unauthorized exchanges. The new effort is to widen regulatory activities to ensure that P2P trading is scrutinized as part of current efforts. However, Prasert assures that registered platforms will not be targeted: \u201cThe move to regulate the P2P platform would not affect cryptocurrency traders on authorized exchanges.\u201d The Minister plans to offer a regulation scheme to the Prime Minister if the SEC cannot modify existing regulations. In addition to P2P trading, the agencies also hope to tackle online fraud and call center scams. Thailand is working on establishing the country as a digital asset hub. In February, the Ministry of Finance excluded crypto trading from value-added tax (VAT) requirements to encourage the use of digital assets. According to the Finance Minister\u2019s secretary, Paopoom Rojanasakul, the vision is to support crypto adoption to drive the digital economy. The ministry waived the 7% tax earlier imposed on the crypto sector, effective January 1. Initially, for authorized crypto exchanges, the waiver now extends to all brokers and dealers under the SEC\u2019s purview. For regulations, the SEC and Finance Ministry are currently modifying the country\u2019s 2019 Securities and Exchange Act.

Their critique covers a range of factors, including the involvement of venture capital (VC) investors and the issuance of separate tokens, as well as the centralized or federated structures that underpin some of these initiatives. The developer\u2019s concerns also extend to projects that offer reciprocal rewards based on user deposits, which they liken to pyramid schemes, and those that incentivize long-term lockups of coins, drawing comparisons to offerings like Hex. Additionally, he was skeptical of L2 platforms that lack comprehensive technical documentation, dismissing them as mere copies of the infamous Bitconnect scheme with a superficial disguise. In a post on X, they said: \u201cIf your Bitcoin L2 has no whitepaper or technical details, only 20 pages of documentation on how to deposit BTC and calculate your future yield, that\u2019s not your L2 that\u2019s Bitconnect wearing a false moustache.\u201d Echoing these concerns is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), who has openly questioned the effectiveness of Bitcoin\u2019s L2 solutions compared to the scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson argues that BTC\u2019s inherent design limitations make it incredibly challenging to implement additional functionality, often requiring the deployment of centralized or federated infrastructures \u2013 a compromise that, in his opinion, undermines the fundamental principles of the coin. The Optimist\u2019s Perspective: Envisioning Bitcoin\u2019s L2-Driven Future However, not all voices in the cryptosphere share this skepticism. Proponents of L2 technologies, like Yago, an X user with over twenty thousand followers, remain steadfast in his belief that these solutions will propel BTC to new heights, making it a cornerstone of modern civilization. He envisions a future where BTC becomes intertwined with various aspects of our lives, driven by the asset\u2019s increasing value as L2 implementations unlock new use cases and efficiencies. It is evident that both sides of the argument present strong and convincing opinions, stating the challenge of promoting new ideas while remaining true to the coin\u2019s commitment to decentralization, which has been the foundation of its success. The Layer 2 solutions offer the potential for the future of BTC by creating opportunities as the Bitcoin community continues to grow and generate innovative ideas. In recent times, we have witnessed a series of developments that have transformed the crypto space, such as AI-enhanced gaming in the crypto space and improved digital wallets that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and additional features for managing digital assets.

According to reports from on-chain analytics, an address linked to the $ONDO project deposited 200,000 $OMNI tokens into Coinbase just a few hours ago, amounting to approximately US$6.65 million. This address is believed to be affiliated with an early investment institution that holds interests in both the Ondo and Omni projects. Remarkably, this address received a distribution of 200,000 tokens from the $OMNI project only 18 hours prior, constituting 1.92% of the total tokens in circulation. Additionally, it acquired a significant amount of 144 million ONDO tokens from the Ondo project on January 18, 2024, equivalent to 1.92% of the total tokens in circulation (representing 10.39% of the total currency circulation). The close relationship between this institution and Coinbase is highlighted by its frequent large-scale deposits and withdrawals of ONDO tokens on the platform in recent months. The timing of this substantial deposit of OMNI tokens to Coinbase is notable, occurring shortly after the announcement of OMNI\u2019s launch. As the OMNI network token continues to face downward pressure, market observers are closely monitoring the implications of such significant on-chain activity.

Litecoin Price & Strategic Rebound Amid Market Volatility After a significant dip to a 45-day low, the Litecoin price has seen a strategic recovery, climbing back to the $78 mark. This rebound is driven mainly by investors leveraging the market dip, seizing the opportunity to buy in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving, which traditionally influences Litecoin prices positively. As geopolitical tensions influence markets, the Litecoin price strategically positions itself for potential gains. With Bitcoin halving just around the corner, the surge in Litecoin trading volume suggests a robust market response. Investors have shown resilience, pushing the Litecoin price toward an early rebound above $90.

This recovery aligns closely with market movements anticipating the Bitcoin halving, which has historically impacted related cryptocurrencies. Enthusiasts and investors are now eyeing the possibility of Dogwifhat reaching a new milestone, spurred by predictions of touching near the $10 mark post-halving. Amidst volatile market conditions, Dogwifhat\u2019s current stability has sparked discussions about it potentially setting a new all-time high.

A new contender is gearing up to join their ranks: Raboo (RABT). Fusing the magic of AI and memes, Raboo is considered to have 100x potential this year, and its presale is just getting underway. Let\u2019s explore these three tokens. Book of Meme: Documenting Web3 culture Book of Meme (BOME), a Solana-based gem, is revolutionizing Web3 culture by immortalizing meme content using IPFS\u2019s decentralized storage software. Book of Meme\u2019s BOME surged over 2,200% within a week of trading last month, marking it as March\u2019s hottest crypto. Most recently, Book of Meme has been integrated into Binance\u2019s crypto loans, a service offering overcollateralized loans for cryptocurrencies like USDT, BTC, and ETH.

Dogwifhat: Bountiful March could signal future gains Dogwifhat (WIF), a fresh twist on the iconic Doge meme built on the Solana blockchain, has quickly climbed the ranks in recent months. Like Book of Meme, Dogwifhat has been added to Binance\u2019s crypto loan, signaling its rising prominence among investors. March saw Dogwifhat\u2019s value soar by over 460%, propelling it to the status of the 3rd most valuable meme coin with a sizable $3.4 billion market cap. Despite a dip from a high of $4.64 to $3.27, this could merely be a set up for further gains. As Dogwifhat navigates these dynamic tides, the question remains: will another rally be enough to fend off competition from Raboo? Raboo: SocialFi pioneer with 100x potential As Book of Meme and Dogwifhat experience a downturn, Raboo (RABT) is fast gaining traction as this bull run\u2019s hottest crypto meme coin. Analysts are seeing bright things ahead for Raboo presale investors, forecasting a tremendous 233% return during its presale, with the potential for a 100x leap upon hitting major exchanges. Raboo is pioneering a SocialFi ecosystem where meme lovers can earn RABT tokens simply by creating and sharing memes. Using Raboo\u2019s cutting-edge generative AI, users can enter fun-packed contests to battle it out to craft the best memes\u2014all for a shot at some impressive awards.

Rumors suggest the presale, which started at a rock-bottom $0.003, might be snapped up in record time. Conclusion As Book of Meme and Dogwifhat cool off from their recent rallies, it\u2019s clear that Raboo might soon become the new market darling. AI, memes, and SocialFi are red-hot sectors right now, and Raboo is at the center of each of these bubbling areas. While the presale is just getting underway, it\u2019s unlikely to last long.

The Shiba Inu community has burnt over 774 million tokens in the past week. NuggetRush\u2019s crypto mining game integrates NFTs with blockchain gaming. Despite a 21.8% price drop over the last week, investors remain hopeful that the new update will resolve network congestion on the Solana network. The update is expected to bring a positive turnaround in the market for SOL. At the same time, the Shiba Inu community has burned over 774 million tokens in just one week. NuggetRush, meanwhile, has integrated some of the best NFTs into their new crypto mining game. The target is to offer its users a real-world gaming experience. NuggetRush (NUGX) raises excitement in the gaming space with NFTs NuggetRush (NUGX) is building a platform where players can assemble the best mining team to explore and mine precious minerals like gold, silver, and diamond. The platform has trending NFTs, which have different users on its gaming platform. Firstly, these NFTs serve as the characters of players and give them unique abilities. These unique abilities \u2013 speed, mining knowledge, and lots more add fun to the game, making it interesting. In addition to the NFTs acting as characters, there are some rare NFTs called RUSHGEMs. Fans have described them as the coolest NFTs, as they can be exchanged for real gold, making them one of the most searched NFTs in the game. Lastly, NFTs can be staked to receive a passive income of up to 20% APY. The amount earned as passive income will depend on the amount of stake and the duration of the stake. Whichever is the case, NuggetRush\u2019s NFTs are being hailed by some as the best NFTs to invest in. The NuggetRush airdrop for its NUGX token is less than a week from now, and investors are excited. The NUGX token, which will be listed at $0.020, could rise 50x after its listing this quarter, according to some chartists. Solana (SOL) price drops to lows at $120 Solana (SOL) price has been on a steep decline in the past week, dropping 21.8% to $124.69. The \u201cEthereum killer\u201d was greatly affected by the latest bear market and issues of failed transactions on its network. Meanwhile, Anza, the development team behind Solana, has launched a new update, v1.17.31, to solve the issue of network congestion. While this is not a major fix, the team said it would release other updates to complete the issue. With this update, we should see positive momentum returning to the Solana ecosystem in the coming days. If this happens, bulls could take SOL to the long-awaited $250 mark. Shiba Inu (SHIB) community burns 774M SHIB Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a rapid increase in its token burn rates. Data from Shibburn shows that over 774 million SHIB tokens were burnt in the last week. This is an increase of nearly 200%. Despite this uptick in burn rates, the circulating supply of the meme coin still stands at 582.80 trillion SHIB. Additionally, Shiba Inu, like many other top altcoins, is still trading in losses. The coin\u2019s price has gone down 24.0% in the past week. Its price could increase in the coming days if positive momentum returns to the market. Final thoughts Solana investors are expecting the new update to bring a positive wave to the SOL token. On the other hand, Shiba Inu\u2019s massive token burn did not affect its price.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui\u2019s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.\u201d Users can read more on the event on the Sui Blog.

BONK slumps 32% in a week, but analysts foresee a resurgence by month\u2019s end. Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ attracts more investors after surging 85% during its presale. Top crypto coins like Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) have recorded double-digit losses over the second week of April as the crypto market continues bleeding. As a result, a growing number of investors are migrating to Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ token, which has surged 85% so far during its ongoing public presale. Why is $RECQ outpacing popular cryptos like SUI and BONK? Continue reading to find out. SUI plummets 33% in a week: will bulls resurface soon? SUI has performed deplorably over the past seven days. On April 7, SUI was changing hands at around $1.65. After a day of range-bound trading, the token rose slightly on April 8 following the announcement of Suilend completing its beta phase, becoming publicly available. Notably, Suilend hit a $30 million TVL during its beta phase, which started on March 11. This news saw SUI jump to as high as $1.72 on April 9. However, the excitement about this news cooled off, and the price began correcting downward. By April 14, the token had stabilized at around $1.10. This price means SUI has shed 33.33% in a week and the subpar performance explains why many investors are abandoning the token. Still, some experts believe SUI will overcome the current bearish trend and climb to $1.91 by the end of April. This forecast could make SUI a good crypto to buy now. Experts base this prediction on SUI gaining more adoption as more Web3 gamers line up to purchase the SuiPlay0X1 handheld gaming device, which SUI introduced on April 10. BONK wipes off 32% in a week: will bears persist? BONK has performed abysmally over the past seven days. On April 7, BONK was hovering around $0.00002317. After a day of sideways trading, BONK gained traction on April 8 after AllDomains announced the number of registered .LetsBONK domain names had exceeded 10,000. This milestone saw BONK jump as high as $0.00002452 on April 8. BONK held this level for a day before the excitement about AllDomain news faded. Consequently, BONK began retracing its growth. By April 14, BONK had leveled off at around $0.00001561. This price means SUI has plunged 32.63% in a week. This lackluster performance has left investors asking, is BONK a top crypto to invest in? According to some experts, BONK could reverse course and jump to $0.00001800 by the end of April. Experts base this prediction on BONK gaining more adoption after the BONK team announced that BONK adopters had locked over 3 trillion BONK on ArmadaFi as of April 12. Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ steals the show after jumping 85% Rebel Satoshi, an upcoming meme coin project, has emerged as the latest sensation in the crypto industry due to its mission to fight centralization. Investors are buzzing about Rebel Satoshi because its mission entails uniting the silent majority and building a vibrant community that champions decentralization. A number of analysts have suggested Rebel Satoshi might be the best ICO to invest in right now because it boasts two tokens, namely $RBLZ and $RECQ. $RBLZ is Rebel SatoshI\u2019s governance and membership token, while $RECQ is its base currency. Interestingly, $RBLZ rewarded Early Bird Round investors of its presale with a 150% ROI. As of April, $RBLZ was available on Coinstore, CoinGecko, Uniswap, and DEXTools. On the other hand, $RECQ had kickstarted Stage 1 of its ongoing public presale. During this round, investors can purchase $RECQ at $0.0037. This price denotes an 85% surge from the Early Bird Round $RECQ price of $0.0020. It is worth pointing out that Rebel Satoshi has set $RECQ\u2019s launch price at $0.0125. When $RECQ attains this price, Early Bird Round investors will get a 525% ROI, while Stage 1 investors will enjoy an ROI of 237.84%.

The discussion provided an in-depth look at the anticipated developments and strategic directions for the crypto industry in the upcoming year. Vugar Usi Zade highlighted the critical importance of prioritizing end-user experiences and privacy, drawing lessons from historical challenges such as the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data scandal. He stressed the necessity for industry leaders to work closely with regulators to enhance user protection without stifling innovation. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that legislation supports the growth of blockchain technologies rather than hindering it,\u201d Usi Zade noted. \u201cAs key players, centralized exchanges should work with legislators and educate them on how blockchain technology works and how introducing legislation should help the end user.\u201d Addressing the infrastructure of the gig economy and energy sectors, Usi Zade shared insights about Bitget\u2019s initiatives to support the integration of blockchain technologies in various industries. \u201cWe are particularly excited about our projects that give NFTs a second chance and promote sustainable energy practices among communities,\u201d he added. A significant focus for Bitget in the coming years, as outlined by Usi Zade, will be on developing and nurturing talent within the blockchain sector. He emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to invest in entrepreneurial innovation on its platform. \u201cWe believe in empowering new talent to build and develop rather than trying to do everything ourselves,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are so many opportunities, and we need so much talent, for the entire economy and industry. In the next two years, we will invest as many resources as possible to develop talent.\u201d With an exemplary track record of safety, Bitget underscores its pledge to user security through substantial financial safeguards, including a robust protection fund. \u201cWe maintain a 200% proof of reserve, ensuring that funds remain secure even if all users withdraw their assets simultaneously.\u201d Usi Zade asserted. \u201cWe have security measures in place, but in case something goes wrong, we have an insured Protection Fund to make sure that there are no customers suffering at the other end.\u201d The Bitget COO emphasized that its Protection Fund is one of the largest in the industry, providing an additional layer of security against potential breaches. Usi Zade also discussed the role of centralized exchanges in facilitating access to the crypto market. He described how Bitget has simplified the transition for users from traditional finance to cryptocurrencies through user-friendly services like social logins and comprehensive customer support. The COO concluded his talk by touching upon the regulatory challenges and the potential of decentralized exchanges to evolve further. \u201cAs legislation in Europe begins to affect how users can transact with non-KYC wallets, centralized exchanges will need to adapt. However, this also presents an opportunity to redefine our roles, potentially acting as intermediaries in large B2B transactions,\u201d he speculated. The panel discussion at Blockchain Life Week 2024 provided much-needed insights into the crypto industry\u2019s expected trajectory. It also reinforced Bitget\u2019s position as a leader prepared to navigate and shape the future landscape of digital currencies.

It was the first conviction in a cryptocurrency market manipulation case. Jail Time Ahead He is now facing substantial prison time: the commodities fraud count and the commodities manipulation count against him each carry a maximum imprisonment of 10 years, while the count of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of up to 20 years. His sentencing is scheduled for July 29. \u201cThis ground-breaking prosecution epitomizes this office\u2019s ability to employ innovative methods and cutting-edge law enforcement tools to continue to protect all financial markets,\u201d US Attorney Damian Williams said. A $110 Million Heist In October 2022, Eisenberg used two accounts to sell a large number of perpetual contracts of Mango\u2019s crypto token MNGO from one of his accounts to the other, thus artificially inflating the price by 1,300 percent in under an hour. He then used the token as collateral to borrow $110 million in other cryptocurrencies from Mango Markets and quickly withdrew the funds. In doing so, he essentially withdrew all the cryptocurrencies deposited on the DeFi platform. Later, he negotiated a settlement with Mango Markets and agreed to return $67 million to the decentralized autonomous organization governing the protocol. He was arrested in December 2022 in Puerto Rico. In court, the defense lawyers tried to convince the jury that Eisenberg\u2019s trades on Mango Markets were \u201csuccessful and legal\u201d and \u201cfully complied\u201d with the decentralized protocol\u2019s scant rules. However, the jury sided with the prosecutors' portrayal of it as a \u201cbrazen\u201d fraud and manipulation. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission also brought civil fraud and market manipulation charges against Eisenberg. \u201cManipulative trading puts our financial markets and investors at risk,\u201d the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Nicole Argentieri, said. \u201cThis prosecution, the first involving the manipulation of cryptocurrency through open-market trades, demonstrates the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to protecting U.S. financial markets and holding wrongdoers accountable, no matter what mechanism they use to commit manipulation and fraud.\u201d This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"A federal jury in New York yesterday (Thursday) convicted Avraham 'Avi' Eisenberg, a crypto trader, for fraud and market manipulation in carrying out a $110 million heist from the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Mango Markets.

In an interview with Bloomberg TV, the CEO of JPMorgan labeled the leading digital asset a \"fraud\" and \"Ponzi Scheme.\" According to Dimon, Bitcoin lacks the fundamental qualities necessary to function as a currency. Dimon Labels Bitcoin \"Ponzi Scheme\" \"Crypto, if you mean crypto like Bitcoin, I've always said it's a fraud. If they think there is a currency, there's no hope for it. It's a Ponzi scheme, it is a public decentralized Ponzi scheme,\" Dimon mentioned. He dismissed Bitcoin as merely a speculative asset, saying those who view it as a legitimate form of money are misguided. Despite acknowledging Bitcoin's role in modern financial markets, Dimon does not believe that the token has the potential to function as a currency. Throughout the years, he has consistently expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, citing concerns about volatility and the lack of regulation. Despite the growing acceptance of the asset by mainstream institutions, Dimon's stance has not changed.

He likened it to a \"pet rock,\" CNBC reported. His comments echoed similar sentiments he expressed in 2021 and the previous year in Davos, terming Bitcoin as \"worthless\" and a \"hyped-up fraud.\" However, Dimon's remarks highlighted a distinction between blockchain technology and Bitcoin. Perspective on Smart Contracts Dimon acknowledged the practical applications of blockchain technology in facilitating efficient transactions and data transfer. He is optimistic about smart contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum, which facilitate the execution of financial transactions without the need for intermediaries. Jamie Dimon on the cryptocurrency industry: \"I'd close it down\" https://t.co/vimnFywEjk \u2014 CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) December 10, 2023 In his latest remarks with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said: \"If it's a crypto coin that can do something like, you know, a smart contract that has value, there will be smart contracts and blockchain works.\" Dimon's latest comments arrived a day before the most important event in the Bitcoin blockchain: Bitcoin halving. This event occurs approximately every four years and cuts the rewards for Bitcoin miners by half. Currently, the cryptocurrency world is excited about the upcoming halving, especially with recent developments like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Jamie Dimon recently affirmed his longstanding stance against Bitcoin. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, the CEO of JPMorgan labeled the leading digital asset a \"fraud\" and \"Ponzi Scheme.\" According to Dimon, Bitcoin lacks the fundamental qualities necessary to function as a currency. Dimon Labels Bitcoin \"Ponzi Scheme\" \"Crypto, if you mean crypto like Bitcoin, I've always said it's a fraud. If they think there is a currency, there's no hope for it. It's a Ponzi scheme, it is a public decentralized Ponzi scheme,\" Dimon mentioned. He dismissed Bitcoin as merely a speculative asset, saying those who view it as a legitimate form of money are misguided. Despite acknowledging Bitcoin's role in modern financial markets, Dimon does not believe that the token has the potential to function as a currency. Throughout the years, he has consistently expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, citing concerns about volatility and the lack of regulation. Despite the growing acceptance of the asset by mainstream institutions, Dimon's stance has not changed.

He likened it to a \"pet rock,\" CNBC reported. His comments echoed similar sentiments he expressed in 2021 and the previous year in Davos, terming Bitcoin as \"worthless\" and a \"hyped-up fraud.\" However, Dimon's remarks highlighted a distinction between blockchain technology and Bitcoin.

The era of opaque interest rates, surprise fees, and the ever-present threat of late payment penalties might be nearing its end. At least, that's the promise Klarna is making with its US debut of the Klarna Card, a new financial instrument aiming to be the smarter, smoother way to shop and pay. Klarna, the Swedish buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) giant, has already carved a niche for itself in the payments industry. Their model lets consumers split purchases into installments, typically interest-free, offering a more controlled alternative to traditional credit cards. Now, with the Klarna Card, they're taking things a step further. This physical and virtual Visa card integrates seamlessly with the Klarna app, allowing users to not only manage payments but also shop for the best deals and track spending in one centralized location. But what truly sets the Klarna Card apart is its commitment to transparency. No more buried fees lurking in the fine print \u2013 Klarna boasts zero annual fees, no monthly fees, and even waives foreign transaction fees for international purchases. This focus on upfront clarity is a welcome change in an industry notorious for its hidden costs. The traditional credit card model has long been criticized for its tendency to encourage impulsive spending and rack up debt. Klarna counters this by promoting responsible financial behavior. The Klarna Card operates on a debit system, meaning users can only spend what they have available. Additionally, it offers a variety of flexible payment options, empowering users to choose how they want to manage their purchases. They can opt to pay their statement in full each month to avoid interest charges, make early payments to chip away at larger purchases, or split eligible transactions into 3 or 6 installments with interest. This level of control allows users to tailor their repayment strategy to their unique financial situation. This focus on responsible spending is underscored by Klarna's data. They report that a significantly lower percentage of their BNPL users incur late fees compared to traditional credit card users. This suggests that the Klarna model, with its emphasis on transparency and control, might be nudging users towards healthier financial habits. Of course, the Klarna Card isn't a magic bullet. Approval requires meeting eligibility criteria, including a credit check. For those who qualify, however, the Klarna Card presents a compelling alternative. It offers the convenience and security of a traditional credit card, with the added benefits of transparency, flexibility, and the potential for rewards through the Klarna app. The Klarna Card's arrival in the US throws down a gauntlet to established credit card companies. Consumers are increasingly demanding more from their financial tools, and Klarna is stepping up to deliver. Whether this new entrant will disrupt the status quo remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Klarna Card injects a dose of competition into the payments industry, which can only benefit consumers seeking smarter ways to manage their money.

Now, with the Klarna Card, they're taking things a step further. This physical and virtual Visa card integrates seamlessly with the Klarna app, allowing users to not only manage payments but also shop for the best deals and track spending in one centralized location. But what truly sets the Klarna Card apart is its commitment to transparency. No more buried fees lurking in the fine print \u2013 Klarna boasts zero annual fees, no monthly fees, and even waives foreign transaction fees for international purchases. This focus on upfront clarity is a welcome change in an industry notorious for its hidden costs. The traditional credit card model has long been criticized for its tendency to encourage impulsive spending and rack up debt. Klarna counters this by promoting responsible financial behavior. The Klarna Card operates on a debit system, meaning users can only spend what they have available. Additionally, it offers a variety of flexible payment options, empowering users to choose how they want to manage their purchases. They can opt to pay their statement in full each month to avoid interest charges, make early payments to chip away at larger purchases, or split eligible transactions into 3 or 6 installments with interest. This level of control allows users to tailor their repayment strategy to their unique financial situation. This focus on responsible spending is underscored by Klarna's data. They report that a significantly lower percentage of their BNPL users incur late fees compared to traditional credit card users. This suggests that the Klarna model, with its emphasis on transparency and control, might be nudging users towards healthier financial habits. Of course, the Klarna Card isn't a magic bullet. Approval requires meeting eligibility criteria, including a credit check. For those who qualify, however, the Klarna Card presents a compelling alternative. It offers the convenience and security of a traditional credit card, with the added benefits of transparency, flexibility, and the potential for rewards through the Klarna app. The Klarna Card's arrival in the US throws down a gauntlet to established credit card companies. Consumers are increasingly demanding more from their financial tools, and Klarna is stepping up to deliver. Whether this new entrant will disrupt the status quo remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Klarna Card injects a dose of competition into the payments industry, which can only benefit consumers seeking smarter ways to manage their money.

This wasn't just another transfer of funds; it was the first payment conducted using the ISO 20022 messaging format, a standardized language poised to streamline the symphony of international finance.

Where barriers to entry once stood, technological advancements are making it possible for anyone to access wealth-creation opportunities that were once the domain of the elite few. At the forefront of this transformation is the emergence of tokens, specifically those that represent real-world assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and others. By reimagining ownership and trading of assets, tokenization is unlocking doors to financial opportunities previously out of reach to many. This shift is not just altering market dynamics, it's laying the foundation for a more equitable and accessible financial future when empowerment and freedom aren't just ideals but tangible realities. Investing in Appreciating Assets - an Economic Necessity The ability to invest capital into assets, instead of holding cash, is not a luxury but a necessity for every household looking to survive and thrive. Holding cash, often perceived as a safe bet, is a silent thief eroded by the relentless march of inflation. Consider this, $100 in 2004, sitting idly, would have the purchasing power of merely $60 today. Contrast this, with the dynamism of the stock market the same amount invested in the S&P 500 over the same period would have quintupled to an impressive $470. Yet, the landscape of stock ownership reveals a stark imbalance. The wealthiest 10% in the US control an overwhelming 93% of stocks, illustrating a deep-seated inequality in financial opportunity and access. This inequality is magnified when looking at sectors like private equity and private credit, where doors often remain closed to everyday investors. Enter Tokenization, the Great Equalizer While a distinctly counter-culture ethos characterized the early days of blockchain, it wasn\u2019t long before traditional financial institutions sought to leverage this technology to improve existing financial pipelines. Thus began the race to tokenize the world and empower traditional assets like stock, bonds, and real estate with the benefits of blockchain, such as 24/7/365 trading, fractional ownership, transparency, and programmability. \u201cThe most important first step is to get in there and start to engage in the ecosystem\u201d\u2014Sandy Kaul of @FTI_Global.How banks and asset managers can get started with tokenization ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/kG2MdNrUdv \u2014 Chainlink (@chainlink) April 17, 2024 Yet, perhaps the greatest advantage of the tokenization of traditional asset classes is the ability to encourage retail participation. Take the Republic Note, for example, a digital asset representing the Republic\u2019s private equity portfolio of over 600 companies, including SpaceX, Maven, and Gumroad. All retail investors have to do to gain exposure to the portfolio is sign up for INX.One, the trading platform where the Republic Note trades 24/7/365. Such a privilege was unthinkable in the pre-tokenization era. The Tokenization Market Is Huge The total addressable market for tokenization is huge, with hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of real-world assets waiting to come on chain. According to Boston Consulting Group, the tokenized asset market is projected to grow to a staggering $16 trillion by 2030. We are still in the early stages of this transformation, with only about 0.03% of the total market size currently captured. At this low level of market penetration, a golden opportunity presents itself to innovative asset managers, institutions, and investors who wish to position themselves on the cusp of a new financial era. #HSBC to Expand Tokenized Asset Offerings \u2014 CEO Says He's 'Very Comfortable' With #Tokenization https://t.co/mjFwfPN7Fw \u2014 Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) April 16, 2024 However, navigating this evolving landscape is not without its challenges.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui (https://sui.io/) is an industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\" said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui\u2019s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.\u201d This article was written by FM Contributors at www.financemagnates.com.","article_summary":"Over 1,000 projects, partners, investors, and enthusiasts from 65 countries around the world gathered last week in Paris to celebrate Sui at the vaunted Layer 1\u2019s inaugural global Sui Basecamp conference.

In 2023, the company handled about GBP 6 billion in payment volume and generated about EUR 5 million in revenue. Neo is headquartered in Barcelona, with offices in the United Kingdom. Interestingly, the UK is also a significant market for the company as about 40 percent of its clients are from there, while others are primarily from Western European countries. The company is presently expanding beyond the European markets and has sizable operations in Canada with plans to expand to Singapore.

Although the ripple effect of SVB's collapse did not reach Europe, customers have become cautious. \u201cCompanies need to diversify their banking partners,\u201d the CEO of Neo added. \u201cThe diversification strategy was used to be true for credit, but I would say it should be for operational purposes.\u201d \u201cWe believe that this is a trend that every company should follow and not rely on one partner.

Of course, that doesn't mean you will lose your money, but it may mean that your money is blocked somewhere or isn\u2019t received by whoever you are trying to pay.\u201d \u201cThat's why you need to work with payment partners who are extremely well connected to the network and have access to the tools to track the payments and ensure that information leveling is correctly done.\u201d Pointing at the challenges of the payment providers, Descout added: \u201cYou need to build your payment corridors very carefully. There is no point in having a fast solution if, on the receiving side or the issuing side, the quality of the exchange and the liquidity are not there.\u201d He further believes there will be \u201cchallenges in the coming years around interconnectivity of clearing systems.\u201d \u201cThe interconnectivity of major clearing systems, and in some cases more local ones, will drive a lot of changes because it's becoming more and more doable to collect monies somewhere and pay somewhere else. I think that will bring many interesting things ahead in terms of international services and definitely for crypto payments supports.\u201d Revolut got a banking licence in Mexico.

We are required to collect more and more information as a payment institution to analyze more and more information on payment changes, which are complex as sometimes we don't even see the entire payment change.\u201d \u201cAI is bringing a lot of analytics capabilities, and we can look at thousands of transactions and spot anomalies, which may trigger some questioning or some analysis all in a couple of seconds.

Of course, that doesn't mean you will lose your money, but it may mean that your money is blocked somewhere or isn\u2019t received by whoever you are trying to pay.\u201d \u201cThat's why you need to work with payment partners who are extremely well connected to the network and have access to the tools to track the payments and ensure that information leveling is correctly done.\u201d Pointing at the challenges of the payment providers, Descout added: \u201cYou need to build your payment corridors very carefully. There is no point in having a fast solution if, on the receiving side or the issuing side, the quality of the exchange and the liquidity are not there.\u201d He further believes there will be \u201cchallenges in the coming years around interconnectivity of clearing systems.\u201d \u201cThe interconnectivity of major clearing systems, and in some cases more local ones, will drive a lot of changes because it's becoming more and more doable to collect monies somewhere and pay somewhere else. I think that will bring many interesting things ahead in terms of international services and definitely for crypto payments supports.\u201d Revolut got a banking licence in Mexico. What does that mean for Fintech? Cross-border is so hot right now. My take 👇Revolut has secured a banking institution licence from Mexico's National Banking and Securities Commission and aims to gain a share of the cross-border payments\u2026 \u2014 Simon Taylor (@sytaylor) April 11, 2024 \u201cAI Is Bringing a Lot of Analytics Capabilities\u201d Like other industries, artificial intelligence (AI) impacts payment flows. And, according to Descout, AI is \u201calready transforming\u201d the payments industry. \u201cThe main advantage of AI now is going to be on the compliance side of things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are, as a payment company, bound by strict regulations. We are required to collect more and more information as a payment institution to analyze more and more information on payment changes, which are complex as sometimes we don't even see the entire payment change.\u201d \u201cAI is bringing a lot of analytics capabilities, and we can look at thousands of transactions and spot anomalies, which may trigger some questioning or some analysis all in a couple of seconds. AI is definitely going to transform the compliance side of our business, making payments quicker and services better.\u201d This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.","guid":"https://www.financemagnates.com//executives/interview/many-payments-firms-are-already-using-stablecoins-neos-ceo","_id":{"date":"Fri Apr 19 15:14:21 ICT 2024","timestamp":1713514461},"creation_date":"2024-04-18T20:40:00Z","category":["interviews","executives"],"type_":"article","article_link":"https://www.financemagnates.com//executives/interview/many-payments-firms-are-already-using-stablecoins-neos-ceo/","website_source":"financemagnates"},{"article_title":"Tanssi Foundation Announces 'Let\u2019s Forkin' Dance'","author":"FM Contributors","article_detailed_content":"The Tanssi Foundation, a key contributor to the development of Tanssi's community and ecosystem, has unveiled \"Let\u2019s Forkin' Dance,\" the Tanssi Incentivized TestNet campaign. This initiative is designed to incentivize participants and propel community growth and network activity in preparation for the upcoming Tanssi Network launch later this year. Backed by leading investors like Arrington Capital, HashKey Capital, Fenbushi, Borderless, The Wormhole Cross-Chain Fund, KR1, YBB, SNZ Capital, and Scytale Digital, alongside angel investors such as Gavin Wood, Tanssi is at the forefront of reinventing the deployment of application-specific blockchains (appchains). These appchains play a crucial role in creating decentralized, user-centric applications. Traditionally, deploying appchains has been cumbersome and time-consuming, often forcing developers to settle for less secure and centralized alternatives. Tanssi's protocol aims to simplify this process to just a few clicks, significantly reducing deployment times from months to minutes. In just six months since its launch, Dancebox, Tanssi's TestNet, has supported over 700 appchain deployments in fields such as DeFi, NFTs, real-world assets, and gaming, showing rapid market adoption. This major step toward the official launch of the Tanssi Network showcases the vibrant activity anticipated once the network is live, inviting everyone to actively participate in the ecosystem.
