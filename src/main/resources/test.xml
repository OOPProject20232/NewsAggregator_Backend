        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Web3 continues to evolve
            rapidly, projects are facing a myriad of challenges that hinder the realization of new ideas. From
            struggling to attract users to combatting sneaky bots, navigating the complexities of Web3 isn&amp;#39;t a
            walk in the park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the core, lies a deep understanding of the significant hurdles
            projects encounter in Web3. One of the toughest challenges is finding genuine users who are genuinely
            invested in a project&amp;#39;s success. With the abundance of noise and misinformation, identifying users
            who truly add value can be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s
            where Bonus Block steps in. It&amp;#39;s a smart platform designed to address these challenges head-on.
            Acting as an on-chain marketplace, Bonus Block connects projects with high-quality users who are genuinely
            interested in their success. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms and blockchain analytics, Bonus Block
            identifies genuine users based on their on-chain activity and behavior patterns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But

            too. By incentivizing on-chain activities, Bonus Block creates a dynamic ecosystem where users are motivated
            to participate. This approach not only drives user engagement but also fosters a strong sense of community
            within the Web3 ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking things a step further, Bonus Block provides innovative
            infrastructure for user onboarding and engagement across ecosystems. By offering a seamless platform for
            projects to connect with users, Bonus Block empowers projects to overcome the limitations of traditional
            marketing channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to its integrated AI solutions, which helps in closely
            monitoring on-chain activities, Bonus Block offers valuable insights that help projects refine their
            engagement strategies and improve user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a unique twist, Web3 quality
            users can earn fees from on-chain activities while being acquired by projects through Bonus Block. This
            creates a win-win scenario where users are rewarded for their contributions, and projects gain access to a
            pool of genuine users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Bonus Block is not just a platform; it&amp;#39;s a
            catalyst for change in the world of decentralized innovation. As we continue to navigate some complexities
            of Web3, Bonus Block stands as a testament to the power of technology to overcome challenges and pave the

            from reading different chats, these are some things I could use clarification on cause I&amp;#39;m very
            interested in learning more about this and all the anon stuff u can do.&lt;br/&gt; I should always be doing
            something like revoke. cash after using a meta mask or uni swap for a transaction.&lt;br/&gt; 2 Shouldn&amp;#39;t
            be using my main computer should have one only for access to the wallet.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Also, I saw something
            about sending transactions not while online and then processing them later somewhere else. seems wild to me
            but I&amp;#39;m interested in it. (don&amp;#39;t broadcast)&lt;br/&gt; 4. Don&amp;#39;t send all coins to
            one wallet.? this one confuses me don&amp;#39;t see how sending any coin to a wallet can affect anything.&lt;br/&gt;
            5. kinda going back to the last someone said don&amp;#39;t use wifi buy a mobile router.&lt;br/&gt; Does
            anyone have anything else to add or can clarify all those points in regards to security in this and staying

            currently studying at University at the moment and one of the modules is &amp;#39;Algorithms and Data
            Structures&amp;#39;. We have been grouped and asked to do a project on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Advance Game
            Theory for Blockchain Resource Mining&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is - the
            lecturer has never spoken about blockchain. I kind of understand the point of it from the little reading I
            did, but it&amp;#39;s hard to fully grasp the concept without really knowing what it is we&amp;#39;re
            supposed to be doing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whomever is on this forum is obviously clued in enough to know
            what their talking about, so could somoene help explain this to me in layman&amp;#39;s terms? The project is
            supposed to have an introduction, body and a real world case study. A few questions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Are there any interesting real life cases where this is implemented?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How
            difficult is this to grasp? (&lt;em&gt;I know thats relative but I like to think I&amp;#39;m reasonably
            intelligent, I&amp;#39;ve just never thought about blockchain&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Does it
            actually have anything to do with this module?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not looking for
            someone to do my project for me, but if someone could point me in the right direction or tell me what it is
            I&amp;#39;m supposed to be looking for?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance guys, I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of Decentralized
            Finance (DeFi) has opened doors for financial inclusion, but for communities with specific ethical
            considerations, like those adhering to Islamic principles, participating in traditional DeFi can be
            challenging. This post explores the technical considerations for building a Sharia-compliant DeFi ecosystem,
            using platforms like Caiz as a potential reference point for discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key Technical
            Areas:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharia-compliant Asset Selection: Identifying financial instruments within DeFi
            that comply with Islamic prohibitions on usury (riba) and speculation (gharar) is essential. Platforms might
            leverage oracles or data feeds to assess the underlying assets&amp;#39; Sharia-compliance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Decentralized
            Sharia Supervisory Board: Can blockchain technology create a transparent and immutable record of Sharia
            compliance oversight? This could involve exploring Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) governed by
            Islamic scholars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart Contract Design: Developing robust smart contracts that automate
            financial transactions while adhering to Sharia principles is crucial. This might involve features for
            profit-sharing agreements and ethical investment screening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technical Challenges and
            Considerations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scalability and Efficiency: Ensuring scalability and transaction
            efficiency within a Sharia-compliant DeFi ecosystem will be crucial for user adoption. Innovative consensus
            mechanisms or Layer 2 solutions might be necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulatory Landscape: Navigating the
            evolving regulatory landscape surrounding DeFi and Sharia-compliant finance will be an ongoing challenge.
            Platforms need to ensure compliance while upholding Islamic principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transparency and
            Auditability: Maintaining transparency and auditability is essential for building user trust. This might
            involve utilizing on-chain data oracles and regular audits by qualified Sharia scholars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discussion
            Points:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are potential technical solutions for ensuring Sharia-compliant asset
            selection within DeFi?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can blockchain technology be leveraged for a decentralized
            Sharia Supervisory Board?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are the technical challenges associated with scaling a
            Sharia-compliant DeFi ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do platforms like Caiz offer any insights into how they
            might address these technical challenges?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Future of Sharia-compliant DeFi:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharia-compliant
            DeFi holds immense potential for expanding financial inclusion within the Islamic community. By addressing
            the technical considerations outlined above, developers can create a robust and trustworthy financial
            ecosystem that aligns with Islamic values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s discuss!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

            help me build a solid baseline to steady state? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32;

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize in advance if
            this is the wrong forum for this question, in which case I would appreciate being directed to another sub.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So... long story short, I&amp;#39;m in an email discussion group that suffers routine censorship
            from the server that the owners of the email group has little control over. Most of the censored words are
            political and, while used in a politically neutral way by the list members, the server gets triggered and
            then all of our emails start bouncing instead of being delivered properly. We keep trying to modify our
            discussions to not trigger the server but it&amp;#39;s getting annoying. Like a lot of social platforms
            these days, the algorithm is deciding for us what can and cannot be discussed, instead of letting the
            culture of the email discussion group sort it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there anything out there like a
            blockchain email discussion server that can&amp;#39;t be censored by big tech? Everything seems to be a
            subsidiary of the big tech industry now and is bound by using the dictates of their political algorithms. At
            one point, our entire group got censored (auto-suspended by the email server) because a member in the group
            mentioned that they almost died from an allergic reaction to a certain drug. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want the
            freedom to discuss what we want to discuss and some of us wonder if maybe blockchain tech is the solution.
            Instead of the discussion group being held in one server at one location, maybe it can be spread out using
            blockchain, such that each member of the group somehow contributes to the totality of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maybe I am not understanding blockchain enough to explain my thinking properly, but I hope I&amp;#39;ve
            given enough info to go off of. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are using Hierarchical
            Deterministic Wallets to generate custodian wallets of user. It uses a mnemonic phrase to generate child
            wallets. Each child wallet has a path like this &amp;quot;m/44&amp;#39;/1&amp;#39;/0&amp;#39;/0/0&amp;quot;.
            using a specific path and mnemonic to generate a child wallet will always return the same public and private
            key pair. So instead of saving private keys of each wallet what if we save path of each wallet, and whenever
            we have to perform a transaction from that wallet. we can just get private key using that path. In this way
            we dont have to go through the process of securely saving private keys of all wallets. Instead we just have
            to make our mnemonic as secure as possible.&lt;br/&gt; It is a good security approach ?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

            expensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I already have 2 cold wallets (trezor and safepal), specific mail address for
            each exchange, multiple exchange accounts with added layer security, google titan key, passwords stored in a
            physical external hd would it make sense to move onto a chromebook? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering that a
            chromebook is probably more performing that the actual one i&amp;#39;m using lol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using a

            recently made the decision to dedicate a few hours each day to learning about blockchain technologies and

            fundamentals of the technology and crypto investing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are there any books or online
            courses that you would recommend that teach the fundamentals in a comprehensive and detailed manner&lt;/p&gt;

            every trade made on a CEX like Binance (not DEX) is registered somewhere and can therefore be found.&lt;br/&gt;
            The following questions come to my mind:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Is it?&lt;br/&gt; 2. A deposit/withdrawal has a Txn
            hash that makes it possible to view it in the blockchain. Does a closed trade also have this and where can
            you find it on the CEX and how to use it in the blockchain (if applicable)?&lt;br/&gt; 3. Which wallet is
            used? Obviously not the one I deposit/withdraw crypto from, but one from the CEX itself, how do I know which
            one it is? Can I find my trade there? Are there specific wallets for certain trades? Are these wallets
            permanently linked to my account or are they random?&lt;br/&gt; 4. Is there a way to view the history of an
            order book of a particular pair on a CEX and can I find my trade there and how? I know there is a trading
            history in my account but that is not what I want to know.&lt;br/&gt; Please provide accurate and detailed
            information in your comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32;

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear CryptoTechnology
            community!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I need urgent help, and I think here is just the right place to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So maybe you guys have seen these types of crypto scams where these seemingless helpless &amp;quot;people&amp;quot;
            post their seed-phrase with a wallet with a few thousand USDT and they pretend that they don&amp;#39;t know
            how to cash it out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when you type in their seed-phrase (photo) you will actually
            find a wallet which has a few thousand USDT coins on it, and you could potentially cash them out yourself.
            But there is this one hook, the USDT coins are on the Tron chain and there isn&amp;#39;t enough gas in the
            form of TRX on the wallet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So you think to yourself, that you just have to send some TRX
            and you will be 3000$ richer. But it will never work out because the gas you send will be immediately stolen
            and sent to the scammer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I paired up with a friend of mine to &amp;quot;scam the scammer&amp;quot;.
            we sent just the right amount of TRX and tried to be quicker. We would then immediately swap the USDT to
            Matic and then send it to OUR wallet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For around half a minute we even had enough gas on
            the wallet!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then the wallet would say &amp;quot;service error&amp;quot; when trying
            to swap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we are wondering if anybody out here knows more about this scam and how to
            outplay it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for all answers in advance!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I am 21M and I have
            been coding mainly in Swift / SwiftUI &amp;amp; Python for years. I have dabbled in Cyber Sec and love it. I
            came across &amp;quot;Blockchain technology&amp;quot; in specifically DEFI and it really piqued my interest.
            I believe it has a future in the world of security and it could be adapted by specific fields. My only
            internal conflict is that everything i see about it on reddit is negative. People saying it will be
            obsolete, that its useless etc. etc. . I am a solo dev and currently not in school for financial reasons, I&amp;#39;m
            saving up to go back but in the mean time I want to create some powerful products that can change lives. I&amp;#39;m
            not asking for the product but the field to learn. I have learned AI/ML but I think it is just going to be
            too competitive and be the thing everyone is learning. Just difficult to not only get a job in but also
            create something unique in. As most of us do, i want to create something that can change lives from my
            computer. I&amp;#39;m looking for something to learn that&amp;#39;s new that has a promising future. And
            before I devote months of time into learning solidity and Blockchain tech.... I want to know if it is worth
            it or not. I haven&amp;#39;t found much posts that were more recent. thanks....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

            this at ethdenver and someone said I should post it here for the tech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically a little
            over a year ago some others and I formed a group to build some dapps we were interested in. During the
            course of development, we realized there was a significant gap on the crypto side for what we wanted to do,
            which was to award users with small parts of larger NFTs and let the users compose together their data into
            what they want. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we set out and ended up building a full stack system called Patchwork
            which goes from base contracts through protocol and development tools. Will link at bottom for those
            interested. The workflow is that a developer, perhaps familiar with ORMs and conventional app data modeling,
            models up their data with JSON and then runs it through a tool that produces contracts that efficiently pack
            the data and support the relationships between the models. A protocol enforces the relations and data
            integrity and there&amp;#39;s a ton of other stuff allowing for contracts to extend other contracts
            permissionlessly, per-field collaborate data permissions, minting, accounting and a thousand little details.
            The system uses 721s as primitives and works with accounts, 721s and 1155s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s
            the link - &lt;a href=&quot;https://patchwork.dev&quot;&gt;https://patchwork.dev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
            is pretty new so would love feedback. Let me know if you have questions and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve
            been following the discussions around Bitcoin&amp;#39;s scripting language, and I stumbled upon something
            intriguing: the proposal to bring back OP_CAT, a previously deactivated opcode. It got me thinking about the
            potential implications for Bitcoin&amp;#39;s future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what do you all think about
            OP_CAT? On one hand, it seems like a powerful tool that could unlock new possibilities for smart contracts
            and enhance Bitcoin&amp;#39;s functionality. But I&amp;#39;ve also heard some concerns about its past issues
            with script size and potential risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From what I understand, OP_CAT enables the
            concatenation of two values on the stack, which could lead to more expressive scripts and innovative
            applications like decentralized file hosting and improved multi-signature schemes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m
            curious about the downsides too. Some folks have mentioned worries about script inflation and community
            divides over its adoption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen examples of OP_CAT in action, like in
            Bitcoin Cash and Liquid BTC, where it&amp;#39;s been used to improve scaling and enable smarter signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m wondering if the benefits outweigh the risks and if the reintroduction of
            OP_CAT could truly be a game-changer for Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Let&amp;#39;s
            discuss! üöÄüîÆ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Mental_Mosaic&quot;&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With proof of work, a node
            can easily look at a chain and discard if if the hashes are below the target. Any fraudulent chain cannot
            compete without being mined by over 51% of the hashrate. But how is this the case in proof of stake? What&amp;#39;s
            stopping a bad actor from making a fake chain that is longer than the real one? Surely there&amp;#39;s no
            way to validate it, as there is no &amp;quot;proof of stake&amp;quot; in the actual block.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I
            thought that maybe the last block&amp;#39;s hash could be used as a seed for a weighted random selection of
            the next validator. That way the next validator can be predicted. And each block could be signed by it&amp;#39;s
            validator to proove that it is genuine. But a list of current staking nodes would be needed to select a
            validator, which is constantly changing. That would mean that there would be no way of verifying that a
            validator of a block was selected fairly. Am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
