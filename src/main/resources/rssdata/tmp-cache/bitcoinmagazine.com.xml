You don’t have to be a Princeton economist to understand the impact this will have on the supply and demand dynamics for bitcoin. Beyond the obvious halving of the block reward, a new market has developed around Ordinals which could have a significant impact on what happens to the first block of the halving. Contained within the first block of the halving is an extremely rare “epic sat”. While Ordinals have divided some Bitcoiners on their merit, there is no arguing the impact they have had on Bitcoin.and it raises an important question, could Ordinals cause a blockchain reorg? Through this article we will dig into the basics of a reorg, Ordinals demand, how mining probabilities work, and finally who could pull off a successful reorg. </p><p>Before we dig into this “epic sat”, let’s build an understanding of what a reorg is. The Bitcoin blockchain is a slow and dumb database that creates blocks of data every 10 minutes or so. It continues working as intended, but occasionally, things get tense. When two miners find blocks nearly simultaneously, it creates a temporary fork in the blockchain. This moment of overlap leads to a brief period of uncertainty. These forks are resolved by the network through the longest chain rule, which is when the fork tip of the blockchain with more proof-of-work (the longest chain or aka more blocks) will be adopted as the valid chain. Orphaned blocks from the shorter chain are not included in the longer one, and the transactions they contain are returned to the mempool to be included in future blocks. This process of one chain becoming longer than the other and becoming the accepted version is known as a reorganization, or reorg.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Due to the incentive structures built into Bitcoin mining, reorgs are usually resolved as soon as the next block is found and added to the tip of one of the forked chains. This is because finding a block is extremely difficult, and miners are incentivized to work on the longest chain in order to build the next block, and get paid. If they are mining on the short fork, the rest of the network will leave them behind and they will have invalid blocks. The last thing you would want is to build a block that is rejected by the network because you’ve built a block on a chain and are rejected by the network due to the longest chain rule. During the reorg period of a fork, miners build on whichever chain fork hits their node first and try to build a block to get the longest chain.</p><p>Now don’t get worried about reorgs. They happen every couple of months (on average) and typically involve one or two blocks. These short reorgs are part of the network’s regular operation and quickly resolve without any significant impact on the network and its users. It’s worth noting that deep reorgs that consist of many blocks are rare and, correspondingly, more disruptive. They can be triggered by a network split such as what happened in the Blocksize wars, or a new large miner coming to the network, or an attempt to double-spend transactions (this is very rare).</p><h2>Most Recent Reorgs</h2><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The Bitcoin protocol and its incentives are designed so that there’s a low likelihood of deep reorgs occurring. Consensus rules and incentives are meant to keep the network stable and secure. For example, most exchanges and payment processors require that a transaction be confirmed by a set number of times—usually six or more—before a transaction can be considered final, thus greatly reducing the chances of it being unwound by a reorg. Small reorgs happen and are mundane and frequent operations within the Bitcoin blockchain, but large reorgs are notable and very irregular.</p><h2>About That Epic Sat</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the buzz about Ordinals, that is “a numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and transferring individual sats”. Some argue that Ordinals are a scam and they have no place in Bitcoin, but here’s the thing, an emerging market is rapidly growing around Ordinals. For now, they are here, and they are getting attention from miners, devs, VC, collectors, scammers, and haters alike.</p><p>When it comes to Ordinals, they are classified by their “rarity” and markets determine value. </p><p>Ordinals rarity levels:</p><p>+ common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block</p><p>+ uncommon: The first sat of each block</p><p>+ rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period</p><p>+ epic: The first sat of each halving epoch</p><p>+ legendary: The first sat of each cycle</p><p>+ mythic: The first sat of the genesis block</p><p>If we consider the scenario where all Bitcoin has been mined, which implies that all 21 million bitcoins (or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis) are in circulation, we can calculate the total quantity of each level of Ordinals:</p><ul><li>Uncommon: There would be a total of 6,929,999 uncommon satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each block.</li><li>Rare: There would be a total of approximately 3,437 rare satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each difficulty adjustment period.</li><li>Epic: There would be a total of 32 epic satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each halving epoch.</li><li>Legendary: There would be approximately 5 legendary satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each cycle (noting a slight approximation due to division).</li><li>Mythic: There is 1 mythic satoshi, which is the first sat of the genesis block.</li></ul><p><br>These figures give an overview of how the rarity classifications would distribute across the total supply of satoshis once all Bitcoin is mined, showcasing the unique and scarce nature of certain satoshis within the Bitcoin network. </p><h2>The Ordinals Market and Beyond</h2><p>Over the past 12 months we’ve seen rapid development in Ordinals technology and markets. Ordinals markets first emerged in Discord back channels where OTC deals were being made, but as demand has grown, digital marketplaces have developed for buying and selling Ordinals. US Based Magisat.io lists various types of Ordinals and has Rare sats listed for a staggering 3.49 BTC. This valuation has led to the creation of additional inventory of Ordinals beyond the category that was first described in the Ordinals documentation.</p><h2>Current Market on Magisat.io for standard Ordinals</h2><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>This data shows that there is a small but growing demand for Ordinals. You can see the volume for Rare amd Uncommon Ordinals are greater than 26 BTC at the time of writing this. Keep in mind that this is only one marketplace and there are a growing number of OTC deals that are happening between buyers and sellers not to mention demand and business happening in other parts of the world.</p><p>Looking beyond Ordinals marketplaces we are now seeing Ordinals make their way to legendary auction house Sotheby’s further propelling the phenomenon towards the mainstream. If you look across the Pacific Ocean there is also significant demand for Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which would not be possible without Ordinals. So the demand for Ordinals is real and it is growing, not waning. </p><p>The last significant item of note that could impact demand for this first block of the halving is the activation of Runes. Runes is another protocol released by the same creator of Ordinals, but the aim of Runes is to make a more efficient token protocol. The kicker on this is that with it going live in the first block of the halving, this alone will cause a significant demand to issue these new tokens as quickly as possible, presumably the first Runes issued will be more valuable than later issued Runes. “Yes there will be reorg incentive for block 840,000, but it's not for epic sat -- it's for the 20btc in fees from Casey's Runes.” said Charlie Spears on X. This fee revenue call is speculation but it comes from observation from previous Ordinals and BRC20 activity. </p><h2>Sifting For Sats</h2><p>In Bitcoin, "dust" refers to an amount of bitcoin so small that it cannot be spent because the cost of a transaction fee would be higher than the amount itself. The concept of a "dust limit" therefore varies depending on the transaction fee and the type of transaction being made. However, there are general guidelines for what is considered dust, based on the type of Bitcoin script or address being used.</p><p>The dust limit is calculated based on the size of the inputs and outputs that make up a transaction. For a transaction to be relayed by most nodes and mined, its outputs must be above the dust limit. The dust limit for a standard P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) transaction output is commonly considered to be 546 satoshis when using the default minimum relay fee of 1 satoshi per byte, but this can vary depending on the network conditions and the policies of individual nodes.</p><p>For different script types, the dust limit calculation takes into account the size of the script and therefore can vary:</p><ul><li>P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash): This is the most common type, and its dust limit is usually around 546 satoshis.</li></ul><ul><li>P2SH (Pay-to-Script Hash): Outputs for P2SH transactions can have a slightly higher dust limit because the script itself is more complex, requiring more data to be included in a transaction.</li></ul><ul><li>P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key Hash) and P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script Hash): These SegWit (Segregated Witness) transactions have different weight calculations, leading to lower fees for the same amount of data. Consequently, the dust limit for SegWit transactions can be lower than for traditional P2PKH transactions. For P2WPKH, the dust limit might be closer to 294 satoshis.</li></ul><ul><li>MultiSig: Transactions involving multiple signatures (MultiSig) have higher dust limits due to the increased data size required to accommodate multiple signatures.</li></ul><p>The exact dust limit can vary because it depends on the transaction's size and the current fee market. Additionally, changes in Bitcoin's protocol or node policies can affect these thresholds. It's also worth noting that some wallets and services might set their own dust limits based on their operational requirements.</p><h3>Pools Sifting</h3><p>Based on the information above we can examine blocks found by pools to see if pools are actively sifting blocks. What we see is 44% of the network is or has sifted for sats in the past year. We have reason to believe that additional pools are in discussions with sifting technology developers in deploying the tech on their pools, but nothing has been made public at this time. Our findings reveal that a very significant percentage of the mining network sees value in sifting for these sats, otherwise this would be a hobbyist endeavor. When this many big players are participating, you know there is some market dynamics happening.</p><figure>

                    <p>Beyond blockchain investigation outlined above, miners are developing new markets of their own in mining irregular transactions for various projects. Most notably is publicluy traded mining pool Marathon who launched a new service called Slipstream which will mine complex transactions such as 1 sat UTXO which is far below the SEGWIT dust threshold of 546 sats. I bring this up because as they are offering this service, you can’t help but assume that Marathon sees or will soon see value in Ordinals of they are willing to invest resources in serving Ordinal or Ordinal adjacent projects with this service. Afterall, the obligation of publicly traded companies is to maximize value for shareholders.</p><p>We know more than 40% of hashrate is sifting for sats, but what does that really mean in the grand scheme of things. Afterall, we are talking about one specific sat, the epic sat in block 840,000. We know that Ordinals have value according to the very small market, we also know that this sat will likely be sold for more than a single blocks reward, but the big question is who could forcibly win this block? Proof of Work is all about the longest chain and ethics don’t matter when it comes to Bitcoin and the blockchain. The chain is truth, even if you were to reorg. If you are hashing and following consensus and you build a longer chain then you are the victor. Based on the table from the previous section, we can see who the top pools are from the past six months. With that information we can model the probability of these pools forking and causing a reorg of the blockchain in order to win the epic sat but we need to run the numbers. For this we will explore the mining section of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. </p><h2>Mining Explained in the Whitepaper</h2><p>Bitcoin mining is a race to find a valid block by solving a cryptographic puzzle, known as proof of work. The difficulty of this puzzle is adjusted by the network so that, on average, a new block is found every 10 minutes, regardless of the total computing power of the network. Now the security of this is where things get interesting. Section 11 of the Bitcoin whitepaper discusses the mathematics behind the security of the blockchain against attackers who try to alter the transaction history. </p><p>The paper uses a comparison to a gambler's "ruin problem" to explain how difficult it is for an attacker to catch up with the rest of the network once they fall behind in the race to add new blocks to the chain. Essentially, if honest nodes control more computational power, the probability that an attacker can catch up decreases rapidly as they fall further behind in the blockchain. The probability that an attacker can catch up becomes almost zero if they do not have a majority of the computational power. </p><p>The section outlines the process where transactions become more secure as new blocks are added to the blockchain, using a Poisson distribution to model the likelihood of an attacker catching up from being behind the chain tip. This framework provides the basis for understanding how blockchain achieves security through probabilistic means not absolute guarantees.</p><p>In the Bitcoin whitepaper, the Poisson distribution is used to model the security of mining. It's used to quantify the probability that an attacker can catch up with the honest nodes after being z blocks behind, which is vital when considering the risk of a blockchain reorganization. It offers a statistical view of how likely it is for an attacker, with a certain percentage of the total network hash rate, to rewrite the blockchain history.</p><figure>

                    <p>Converting to C code...</p><p>#include <math.h></p><p>double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)</p><p>{</p><p>    double p = 1.0 - q;</p><p>    double lambda = z * (q / p);</p><p>    double sum = 1.0;</p><p>    int i, k;</p><p>    for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)</p><p>    {</p><p>        double poisson = exp(-lambda);</p><p>        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)</p><p>        poisson *= lambda / i;</p><p>        sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));</p><p>    }</p><p>    return sum;</p><p>}</p><h2>Who Could Pull This Off?</h2><p>Ordinals introduces a new incentive to reorg. Before Ordinals, the threat of a reorg was focused around a double spend attack, but Ordinals introduced the demand for individual sats, in this case the demand to win a specific block. The question is this, does the value of a single Epic sat or block warrant abandoning the longest chain in hopes of finding a couple quick blocks and winning that epic sat? Pubco mining pools will have a hard time justifying such action to shareholders, it seems negligent. But for private mining pools, they have different incentives and have a bit more freedom in how they pursue revenue.</p><p>Looking at the top 10 mining pools by their percent of the network, we can model out who could pull off a reorg. One thing of note, the formulas described in the whitepaper only model catching up with the chain tip, however a reorg would require catching up to the tip +1 block, so our values below show that probability.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODI4OTYzMjY2NzMzMTI1/table5.png" height="800" width="1018">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The first thing I noticed was Foundry and Antpool have a higher % probability of pulling off a reorg from 1 block behind than their own % hashrate of the network. How could this be possible? This is because A miner with 30% of the hashrate being 1 block behind and attempting a reorg is at a disadvantage because the rest of the network (70% hashrate) collectively has a higher probability of extending the current longest chain before the miner can catch up and surpass it. However, due to the randomness captured by the Poisson distribution, there's always a non-zero probability that this miner could, through a streak of good luck, mine enough blocks in a row to take over the longest chain, even from one block behind. This is statistically unlikely but becomes possible with higher hashrate percentages and short reorg depths.</p><p>The next key takeaway is how successful reorgs become less likely for each block they are behind. It is remarkable how Foundry could still reorg from 5 blocks behind. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Bitcoin space is weird (always has been) and bitcoin miners are the longest of long when it comes to outlook on Bitcoin. Based on the reorg probability and the potential value from the additional value on the first block of the halving, the probability of a reorg feels likely. If you take the BTC mined from this block, the epic sat, plus the projected amount of fees that will be earned from the release of Runes, bigger pools would be foolish to not try and make a move to win this block. The only real downside of a reorg would be by working on the old chain and NOT winning the reorg, so you would miss out on possibly winning 1-2 blocks by mining on the original longest chain. I do hope for fireworks. It will be legendary to hear the talk tracks from the new Wall Street financial bros trying to explain this. At the end of the day, miners will have to make a decision, that is to simply build on the longest chain or to try and build the longest chain with heavy amounts of luck. They must consider the tradeoffs and pick their poisson.</p><p>CODE</p><p>===========REORG-SUCCESS.RB=========================================</p><p># ----</p><p># Data</p><p># ----</p><p>miners = {</p><p> '    foundryusa' => 30,</p><p>    'antpool' => 25.64,</p><p>    'f2pool' => 12.35,</p><p>    'viabtc' => 10.98,</p><p>    'binancepool' => 6.49,</p><p>    'marapool' => 3.78,</p><p>    'luxor' => 2.93,</p><p>    'sbicrypto' => 1.90,</p><p>    'btcdotcom' => 1.54,</p><p>    'braiinspool' => 1.29,</p><p>    'unknown' => 1.27,</p><p>}</p><p># --------</p><p># Equation</p><p># --------</p><p>def attacker_success_probability(q, z)</p><p>    # p = probability honest node finds the next block</p><p>    # q = probability attacker finds the next block</p><p>    # z = number of blocks to catch up</p><p>    p = 1 - q</p><p>    lambda = z * (q / p) # expected number of occurrences in the poisson distribution</p><p>    sum = 1.0</p><p>    for k in 0..z</p><p>    poisson = Math.exp(-lambda) # exp() raises e (natural logarithm) to a number</p><p>    for i in 1..k</p><p>        poisson *= lambda / i</p><p>    end</p><p>    sum -= poisson * (1 - (q/p)**(z-k) )</p><p>    end</p><p>    return sum</p><p>end</p><p># --------</p><p># Results</p><p># --------</p><p># Run through each of the miners in the list</p><p>miners.each do |miner, percentage|</p><p>    # Print miner name</p><p>    puts "#{miner}"</p><p>    # Convert percentage to probability</p><p>    probability = percentage / 100.0</p><p>    # Calculate their success of replacing a different number of blocks near the top of the chain</p><p>    1.upto(5) do |blocks|</p><p>    # NOTE!</p><p>    # Add 1 to the number of blocks.</p><p>    # This is because we don't want to calculate the probability of merely catching up to the tip of the chain (which is what the equation calculates).</p><p>    # To perform a successful attack, we want calculate the probability of building a chain that is ONE BLOCK LONGER than the current chain.

The amount of bitcoin, the frequency it needs to be accessed, and other factors can determine which approach makes the most sense. </p><p>The resources and security requirements of individual bitcoin holders will differ from those of institutions. In this article, we’ll take a look at how the custody strategies for these two groups compare, and then uncover an important truth about the application of multisig.</p><h2>Custody for individuals</h2><p>For typical individuals looking to hold bitcoin in self-custody, there are a number of tools to choose from. Depending on the situation, a simple singlesig wallet could be sufficient, with the option to add modifications such as seed phrase copying or BIP 39 passphrases. We created <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">an article going into detail on various configurations</a>, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>Individuals less concerned with making frequent withdrawals, and looking to secure larger amounts for long-term savings, should consider a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multisig wallet</a>. Multisig offers <em>threshold security</em>, which can protect users from single points of failure, ensuring that no funds are lost if any one component of the setup is destroyed, misplaced, or stolen. Achieving threshold security is crucial for anyone who wishes to protect a substantial amount of funds.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>There are a couple of other methods of threshold security besides multisig, but they are less appropriate for the average person. Shamir’s secret share (SSS) is one method that still leads to temporary single points of failure during the initial setup, and during a withdrawal procedure. Multiparty computation (MPC) is another method which is extremely complicated to safely use. You can learn more about these in <a href="https://unchained.com/features/mpc-vs-multisig-vs-sss/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our article about threshold security models</a>.</p><p>Multisig can be combined with SSS or MPC to create <em>multi-level thresholds</em>. Multi-level thresholds refers to a threshold on the blockchain level (multisig) as well as a threshold on the key level (SSS or MPC). By combining these concepts, a fundamental threshold of keys serves as the primary security for bitcoin holdings, and each key can have protection from becoming compromised by using a threshold of its own. Despite a more complicated structure, two levels of thresholds offers clear advantages for keeping bitcoin maximally secure.</p><p>For a sole individual trying to protect their bitcoin, this approach is widely considered unnecessarily complex. However, if the individual enters a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/diy-vs-collaborative-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">collaborative custody partnership</a> with one or more institutional <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a> capable of deploying SSS or MPC, this increased layer of security becomes more easily accessible.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODMwMTc3OTM3MjM3MDYx/group-2085664284-copy.png" height="800" width="955">

                    </figure>
                    <h2>Custody for institutions</h2><p>For companies, governments and other institutions who want to secure a bitcoin treasury, it wouldn’t be appropriate to employ some of the custody strategies used by typical individuals. If multiple people are responsible for large sums of money, more rigorous controls are necessary. Institutional-grade bitcoin custody requires threshold security as a bare minimum.</p><p>Multisig, SSS, and MPC are the available choices to meet that requirement. While MPC is by far the most complicated to safely use, and wouldn’t be recommended for individuals, an institution with a team of experts might consider it. However, the extra effort to set up MPC doesn’t mean that it’s a superior option to basic multisig. All three models have trade offs, as discussed in <a href="https://unchained.com/features/mpc-vs-multisig-vs-sss/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our earlier article comparing them</a>.</p><p>If an institution wants the highest level of security possible, they should consider using multi-level thresholds. In this arrangement, the foundation is multisig, which allows for a threshold of multiple separate private keys in order to access funds. Several different <a href="https://unchained.com/private-wealth-and-enterprise">enterprise key agents</a> can be responsible for each key, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-multi-institution-custody/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">minimizing counterparty risk from any single custodian</a>. Additionally, each key agent <em>can apply their own threshold security</em> for the key they are responsible for, by using SSS or MPC. This protects the key from any single officer within the key agent firm.</p><figure>

                        <figcaption>Institutions would be unwise to use a custody model lacking threshold security for their bitcoin treasury. There are several threshold options to choose from, and for the utmost security, they can be combined to form multi-level thresholds.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h2>Multisig has a higher security ceiling</h2><p>As you may have noticed from the charts above, there is a distinct difference between the upper security limits of singlesig and multisig. With singlesig, there is only a single key which can have a threshold applied to it, creating a single-level threshold. Multisig can act as a single-level threshold as well, but also travel a step further: it can be the foundation of multi-level thresholds.</p><p>Therefore, sizable bitcoin holdings that utilize a singlesig foundation rather than a multisig foundation—which can often <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/wealthiest-bitcoin-holders-security/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">be observed by examining the address type</a>—have an opportunity for a security upgrade. Multi-level thresholds can unlock a robust <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-multi-institution-custody/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multi-institution custody structure</a> that distributes risk across key agents. Unchained private wealth and enterprise clients have several high-end key agents to choose from in order to set up this structure. <a href="https://unchained.com/private-wealth-and-enterprise/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Learn more and book a consultation</a>!</p><blockquote><p><em>Originally published on </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/multisig-security-ceiling/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/"></a></em><em>.<br></em><em><br>Unchained is the official US Collaborative Custody partner of Bitcoin Magazine and an integral sponsor of related content published through Bitcoin Magazine.

Spending countless hours in solitude, meticulously writing the code that would bring the world its first-ever successful attempt at creating a truly decentralized monetary network, the first of which our species has ever had the privilege of experiencing. The pseudonymous creator’s thought process is one we can’t picture - laying out Bitcoin’s framework and ironing out the innovation that is the network’s distributed ledger, the complex mining process that secures it. And then, one of the most fundamental, yet underappreciated, pieces of Satoshi's design was the pre-coded, fixed supply schedule with a 50% reduction in new issuance that happens quadrennially - the Bitcoin halving.</p><p>Hard-coded into Bitcoin’s core, this deflationary event called “the halving”, which enforces the reduction in the supply of the bitcoins being introduced into circulation, is undoubtedly a crucial technical element of the protocol and was a foundational design choice. The creation of a digital currency that would maintain its scarcity and by extension its value, over the long term. A digital currency that would exist beyond the reach of central banking policies and the whims of the hands that control them. That was Satoshi’s idea. And to properly execute this, it had to have a pre-programmed finite supply of 21 million units, with an engineered supply compression mechanism that gradually slows down the rate of issuance of new coins in a four-year cycle. I’m not going to get into too much detail about the Bitcoin halving and its technical aspects, because a lot of brilliant minds have already talked extensively about it, so why reinvent the wheel? Rather, let’s take a few steps back in time.</p><h2>15 YEARS AGO</h2><p>Let's go back a decade and a half, back to those grueling hours Satoshi Nakamoto must have spent working on Bitcoin. Hunched over, working tirelessly on the code, integrating the halving and all it was meant to represent for the network as a mechanism that ensures the long-term scarcity of this new digital currency. Theoretically, he must have known the profound impact the halving would have on the fiat value of Bitcoin. I mean, considering basic economics and how scarcity inversely correlates with value, it couldn’t have been hard to derive that conclusion. However, is it possible that he could have anticipated the significant cultural influence this pre-programmed technical process would take on? </p><p>In those early days, the Bitcoin community was a tiny one, comprising merely thousands globally - a few cypherpunks here and there, coders, and a handful of libertarian idealists tinkering in home offices, basements, and dorm rooms, securing the network while earning those block rewards. Unaware, of course, of the frenzy and excitement that would one day surround each approaching halving. </p><p>And yet, that obscure, humble beginning, was about to birth a cultural phenomenon unlike anything those first few miners nor even Satoshi could have envisioned. With the gradual emergence of Bitcoin into mainstream consciousness over its 15 years of existence, the 4-year hard-coded algorithmic ritual morphed from mere technicalities of a program, into a global celebration - an event that unifies Bitcoiners worldwide, no matter their creed, race, and political ideology and all other superficial ethnocultural and socio-economic classifications we have created - eagerly anticipating, planning parties, that have now come to mark the progression of this monetary revolution. </p><h2>FROM MACRO EVENT TO QUASI-HOLIDAY</h2><p>The once arcane, behind-the-scenes process of miners receiving fewer freshly minted bitcoin, blossomed into a veritable quasi-holiday for Bitcoiners and Cryptography enthusiasts. With its gradual emergence from the fringes, from the darker corners of the internet back in the days when it used to be seen as a tool for hackers, unscrupulous individuals, and bad actors, Bitcoin gained mainstream awareness, enabling the halving to take up a seemingly mystical significance. It became not just a routine supply shock in BTC issuance, but a chance for Bitcoiners around the world to unite in their shared commitment to a monetary protocol that at its foundation, possesses the core principles of decentralization, limited supply, and independence from government manipulation.</p><p>As we approach the 2024 halving - depending on when you’ll be reading this - it has become curiously impossible to ignore the growing cultural significance of this event. Halving countdowns have now become a recurrent element on social media. Bitcoin and Crypto news platforms, as well as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/business/bitcoin-price-surge-halving/index.html">mainstream media outlets</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-04-09/all-eyes-on-bitcoin-s-halving-event-video">other financial news platforms</a>, have published reports about the halving over the past few months. And then there are <a href="https://stacker.news/items/359532">events and parties scheduled throughout April 2024</a>. At these events, Bitcoiners will gather for halving-themed parties and events across the globe - from a "Bit-Rave" festival in San Salvador to themed happy hours in the pubs of Bedford, UK, and even a lakeside gathering in the California desert. There’s even talks of a bitcoin halving festival being held in Calabar, Nigeria. It's a fair bet that there must be a bunch of other such events either already past, or scheduled to hold within the month somewhere in the world.</p><p>Though admittedly not all of them are exactly “halving parties”, but, the fact that they are all scheduled for April when we expect the confirmation of the 840,000th block, tells all. </p><h2>CEMENTING SATOSHI’S VISION FOR SCARCITY AND DECENTRALIZATION</h2><p>As we look ahead towards the 2024 halving considering what it has grown to be these past decade-plus, one question comes to mind; will this quadrennial event continue to hold such profound significance? Bitcoin’s identity seems to have formed its base around the halving. It seems to have been ingrained in such a way that Bitcoin, as we know it today, will not be what it is without the event. That much is clear. It creates a reliable, as well as a predictable cadence for Bitcoiners to gather in a shared celebration of the protocol's core ethos. Each iteration reinforces the network's commitment to true digital scarcity, decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance - the very principles that drew early adopters to this monetary revolution in the first place. The very same principles on which Satoshi’s vision - not the flawed BSV fork though - is based. </p><p>The halving can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy - each supply squeeze is expected to drive up bitcoin’s price, thereby further cementing its place as a store-of-value asset that transcends time. This “prophecy” has enabled analysts, traders, and institutions to develop entire frameworks around the halving’s anticipated impact. Which further emphasizes the point earlier alluded to; that it is ingrained in Bitcoin’s identity. This weaves it into the cultural fabric of the digital currency in a way that transcends its origins as merely a technicality. </p><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>As the 2024 Bitcoin halving approaches, its ever enduring significance may lie in its ability to consistently remind Bitcoiners of the network's unwavering principles. In an era marked by rapid technological shifts and widespread social upheaval, the halving's reliability and unchanging nature provides a sense of stability - a guidepost - so to speak - for this movement. </p><p>The halving serves as a totem, a rallying cry that unites Bitcoiners in their commitment to this monetary revolution, regardless of the fluctuations and disruptions that are unavoidable in the world we live in today. It will remain a quadrennial occurrence that will continue to hold an honored place in Bitcoin culture, reminding us of each passing cycle of the network's unshakable principles and the unstoppable force of Satoshi's infallible creation.</p><p>This event, this beacon of hope in unsettling times, represents an enduring constant, a touchstone that reinforces the immutable foundations upon which the Bitcoin network is built. As the celebrations surrounding the 2024 halving reach a fever pitch once more, we can be certain that this tradition will remain a vital part of the Bitcoin movement, serving as a guidepost for adherents weathering the storms of a rapidly changing technological, social landscape, geopolitical uncertainties, and global economic maelstrom.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Emeka Ugbah</em><em>.

As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same.</p><p>With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/when-is-the-next-bitcoin-halving">April 19</a>, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of <a href="https://www.mara.com/">Marathon Digital Holdings</a>, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn’t appear to be breaking a sweat.</p><p>Why’s that?</p><p>One of the reasons is that Marathon plans to generate alternative streams of revenue utilizing the heat emitted from its bitcoin mining rigs.</p><p>“Bitcoin mining in and of itself does something very efficiently, which is produce heat,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. “50% of industrial energy spend is spent to heat things, so imagine if you could capture the heat from Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin miners could get paid for that. That would subsidize their cost of electricity.”</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unNnCsQi8e8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>During a fireside chat with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) at the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/policymakers-industry-leaders-to-gather-in-washington-dc-for-annual-bitcoin-policy-summit">Bitcoin Policy Summit</a>, held on April 9, 2024 in Washington, DC, Thiel shared an example of how Marathon plans to utilize the heat its miners produce.</p><p>“One of the things we’re doing in Nebraska actually is we’re starting to heat greenhouses and do shrimp farming using the heat from Bitcoin mining as a byproduct,” Thiel explained to Senator Lummis.</p><p>“I think you’re going to start seeing this as a way for people to grow proteins in areas of the disadvantaged world,” he added.</p><p>Utilizing the heat Marathon’s miners produce is one of the ways in which Thiel is looking to change the perception of Bitcoin mining from something that’s parasitic to something that’s productive.</p><p>This dovetails well with the fact that Marathon continues to improve its ability to use waste gas as fuel for its miners.</p><p>Toward the end of 2023, Marathon launched a pilot project in which it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/marathon-digital-holdings-launches-pilot-landfill-methane-powered-bitcoin-mining-project">mined bitcoin with energy derived solely with landfill methane</a>, a gas that’s 80x more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2.</p><p>The project was a success, according to Thiel.</p><p>“It was a proof of concept that showed that you could successfully mine bitcoin using landfill methane gas,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “Mining on landfills is very hard, but we were able to prove that you could do it quite successfully.”</p><p>Thiel expanded on these efforts in his conversation with Senator Lummis, tying together the ideas that Marathon could produce this heat it plans to use while having a positive impact on the environment.</p><p>“You generate energy with that by turning it into methane and then converting that into electricity and you create heat with the electricity,” he told Senator Lummis. “If you can take a waste product, turn it into energy and feed heat back into an industrial process, you do more for the environment than a lot of environmentalists want. And at the same time, your cost to mine bitcoin becomes very small because your energy cost is low.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"><media:title>bitcoin-mining-rig-fan</media:title><media:text>Serhiy Tron, a former boxer, a persistent entrepreneur and the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine Ukraine, fights for stability in an unstable world.</media:text></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BlackRock Releases Bitcoin Education Series]]></title><description><![CDATA[The worlds largest asset manager continues to market and educate new investors on its spot Bitcoin ETF.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-releases-bitcoin-education-series</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-releases-bitcoin-education-series</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[SEC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blackrock]]></category><category><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Etf]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 16:02:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODA1MTUzNTc4NjU3NjYz/mjawotm3mdy0nzczmdaynji2.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a series of educational content aimed at explaining Bitcoin, the Bitcoin halving, and its implications, along with insights into its approved spot Bitcoin ETF.</p><p>"April is packed with rare events this year, with eyes set on the upcoming bitcoin halving - a unique process that only happens every 4 years," said U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, Jay Jacobs.

I will not refer to it as a whitepaper, those are real academic documents for adults. In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. </p><p>The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we’ll have to break down the two pieces involved. </p><h2>The Building Blocks</h2><p>Rijndael’s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate “staging” transaction to withdraw their funds from the vault. This kicks off a timelock, during which they can at any time send their funds back to the vault or a secure cold storage wallet, and after the timelock the user can freely withdraw the funds to the destination they chose when beginning the withdrawal process. These are the <em>only</em> two ways bitcoin sent to the vault script can be spent. </p><p>Explaining the full mechanics of how this is accomplished is essentially an article in itself, so I’m going to do something I usually don’t and hand waive this away as “magic.” (Explained <a href="https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/blog/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-i.html">here</a> by Andrew Poelstra) What this “magic” allows you to do, by creating non-standard Schnorr signatures and with the help of OP_CAT, is to build the transaction the signature check is against on the script stack. This lets you enforce that certain parts of the transaction are exactly as defined ahead of time. It also allows you to put the output from a previous transaction on the stack in the process of building the transaction spending it, meaning you can compare outputs from the spending transaction against outputs from the previous transaction. This allows you to guarantee by comparing them that certain parts of the previous transaction’s outputs match certain parts of the new outputs. I.e. the script, or an amount. So you can “carry forward” parts of the old outputs into the new ones, and enforce that. </p><p>Something else you can do with OP_CAT, which did not need Rijndael tinkering and experimenting with to prove, is verify merkle tree branches. Because you can CAT stack items together, and Bitcoin already supports hashing data on the stack, you can slowly build up a merkle tree root from a leaf node with the interior nodes. Hash two pieces together to get one hash, hash that with the pair hash, and so on. Eventually you get the root hash on the stack. You can then compare it with OP_EQUAL against a predefined root hash in the locking script. </p><h2>Unilateral Withdrawal</h2><p>These two building blocks are enough to facilitate a unilateral withdrawal mechanism from a group shared UTXO. A merkle root can be embedded in a transaction using OP_RETURN or another mechanism that commits to a leaf node for each user. The UTXO script can be structured so that any user with a balance can attempt to withdraw it. To do so they would provide the merkle branch committing to the amount they are entitled to, the authorization proof such as a public key to check a signature against, and construct the transaction on the stack to verify the appropriate conditions are met. </p><p>Similar to Rijndael’s OP_CAT vault, this withdrawal transaction would function as a staging point. User funds would be restricted by a timelock, and they would not be capable of completing the withdrawal until it expires. At any time before the timelock expires, any other user can create a fraud proof to stop the withdrawal and shove funds back into the group UTXO script. They can do this because of OP_CAT’s ability to verify merkle trees. If someone has used a specific merkle branch to withdraw funds from the UTXO before, then that was included in a block somewhere. By constructing a transaction containing the SPV proof of that transaction inside an actual block, which can use OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL to verify the blockheader meets some minimum difficulty, they can prove <em>on the stack</em> that the merkle branch was used before. This allows duplicate withdrawals to be prevented. </p><p>In addition to this, because you can use the “CAT on the stack” trick to ensure specific pieces of a previous transaction must be included in the next, you can guarantee that the current merkle root is carried forward into the next transaction after a successful withdrawal. You can also guarantee that change from the withdrawal goes back into the group sharing script. This guarantees that after one user withdraws their funds, the change UTXO is locked with a script that allows any remaining user to withdraw, and so on. Any user can unilaterally withdraw their funds at any time in any order, with the guarantee that the remainder of funds are still accessible to the rest of the users. </p><h2>The VM Part</h2><p>Readers should be familiar with the basic idea of BitVM. You can take an arbitrary computation and break it up into each of its constituent pieces and embed them in a large taproot tree, turning that computation into a back and forth challenge/response game. This allows you to lock bitcoin with more complicated conditions than is directly supported by bitcoin script itself. The only real shortcoming is the need to craft a massive amount of pre-signed transactions to facilitate this. </p><p>The requirement to use pre-signed transactions is so that in the challenge/response dynamic, you can guarantee that coins are spent back into the large taproot tree encoding it unless an exit condition one way or the other is reached. OP_CAT and the ability to “carry forward” data from previous transactions allows you to guarantee that without needing pre-signed transactions. </p><p>So not only does this scheme allow any user to unilaterally exit on their own, it also allows locking conditions supported by a second layer that are not supported by Bitcoin script to actually be enforced in the withdrawal process. I.e. if some coins were encumbered by a smart contract the base layer doesn’t understand, and then withdrawn from the second layer, those more complicated conditions could still be settled correctly on the base layer as the coins are withdrawn. </p><h2>The Missing Piece</h2><p>One thing that OP_CAT does not enable is updating a merkle tree root representing user balances off-chain verifiably. It can enable an already committed state to facilitate unilateral withdrawals, but that is because a whole section of the tree is actually put on-chain and verified. To update that root off-chain by definition means you are not putting the data on-chain. This represents a problem. There is no way with just CAT to efficiently verify that all changes to the merkle tree were authorized properly by the relevant users. </p><p>Someone(s) has to be trusted, and by the nature of things capable of spending the UTXO however and wherever they want, to efficiently replace an old state root with a new one to represent all off-chain balance changes. A new opcode in addition to OP_CAT, such as OP_ZKVERIFY, would be needed to do this in a trustless manner. </p><p>This wouldn’t be the end of the world without OP_ZKVERIFY though. The entity updating the merkle root for off-chain transfers could be an n-of-n multisig, with 100% of the participants required to sign off on any root changes. This boils down to the same trust model as BitVM based pegs, where as long as a single honest participant exists, no one's funds can be stolen. It is a stark improvement over existing BitVM designs however when it comes to the withdrawal process. </p><p>In BitVM pegs, users do not have a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. Peg operators must be trusted to fulfill user withdrawals, knowing that they can claim back funds they have spent doing so relatively trustlessly from the BitVM peg. While the incentives of this are very solid, it still does require users essentially getting permission from someone else to exit the system, they cannot do it on their own. With CatVM, users can claim back their funds unilaterally, and an operator is not required to front their own liquidity to process withdrawals. </p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Overall, the design is incomplete in terms of construction. This is not something I would call a Layer 2 in and of itself. It is the core of one, the mechanism and structure for how funds are locked into a Layer 2, and the process for how users can withdraw their funds. It definitely has a lot of flexibility and usefulness to it. </p><p>In the worst case scenario, users do not need anyone’s permission to safely claim their funds back on-chain. It also allows more flexible programmability of funds, while still carrying the enforcement of those conditions to the base layer in the event of worst case unilateral exits. If one day we do eventually get something like OP_ZKVERIFY, the off-chain state progression can become an actually trustless process. </p><p>I don’t expect any concrete demos in the near future, but it definitely is a sound idea in my opinion, and something worth considering. It also shows that the wizards are doing a little more than just pumping stupid jpegs. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"><media:title>default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breaking Down The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Implications and Predictions for Bitcoin Miners]]></title><description><![CDATA[What lies after Bitcoin’s 4th halving?

This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining.</p><h2>Economic Outlook and Market Predictions</h2><p>After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network. Luxor’s <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/">Hashrate Index</a> Research Team projects about 3-7% of <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-network-hashrate">Bitcoin’s hashrate</a> could go offline if Bitcoin’s price maintains its current level. However, if prices fall, up to 16% of the hashrate could become economically unviable, depending on the trajectory of Bitcoin prices and transaction fees post-halving.</p><p>The hashrate, a critical security measure for Bitcoin, might adjust along with difficulty levels to align with the new economic realities. Luxor’s analysis suggests different scenarios where the network's hashrate could end up ranging from 639 EH/s to 674 EH/s by year's end, reflecting adjustments to the new earning potential post-halving.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMTUzNDY2MTQwNTQz/image2.png" height="754" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>ASIC Pricing and Breakeven Points</h2><p>Post-halving, the profitability of different ASIC models will become crucial as the mining reward drops. Lower rewards mean that only the most efficient machines will be able to operate profitably if the price of Bitcoin does not see a significant increase. For instance, according to Luxor’s projections, next-generation ASICs like the S19 XP and M30S++ might have breakeven power costs ranging from $0.07/kWh to $0.15/kWh, depending on post-Halving <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index">hashprice</a>.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMTUzNDY2MjA2MDc5/image4.png" height="301" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>This shift in profitability will likely lead to a repricing of ASIC machines. Historical data suggests that ASIC prices are highly correlated with hashprice; therefore, the anticipated reduction in hashprice will prompt a downward adjustment in ASIC values. This will particularly impact older and less efficient models, potentially accelerating their phase-out from the market.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>The Role of Custom ASIC Firmware Post-Halving</h2><p>To combat reduced profitability, miners are increasingly turning to custom ASIC firmware to improve the efficiency of their hardware. Firmware like <a href="https://luxor.tech/firmware">LuxOS</a> and BraiinsOS can enhance the performance of machines by optimizing their power usage and hashrate output, thus lowering the breakeven point for electricity costs. For example, underclocking an S19 with custom firmware could extend its operational viability by reducing its power draw, thereby maintaining profitability even at lower hashprices.</p><p>Public miners, in particular, are adopting custom firmware to boost the efficiency of their fleets. Companies like CleanSpark and Marathon have reported using custom solutions to enhance their operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to grow as more miners seek to maximize their output and minimize costs in the face of decreasing block rewards.</p><figure>

                    <h2>2024 Bitcoin Halving and Beyond</h2><p>The 2024 Bitcoin Halving is set to reshape the mining landscape significantly, just as previous halvings have. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, the event will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities. Miners who plan strategically, taking into account both economic forecasts and operational efficiencies, will be better positioned to navigate the post-halving environment. For those in the Bitcoin mining industry, staying informed and adaptable will be key to leveraging the halving event as an opportunity rather than a setback. With the right preparations, particularly in ASIC management and firmware optimization, miners can continue to thrive even under tightened economic conditions.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by El Sultan Bitcoin.

Against the backdrop of global discussions on Bitcoin regulation—and coinciding with a solar eclipse—the summit aimed to be a beacon of reason and a catalyst for action in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets.<br><br></p><p>The Bitcoin Policy Summit boasted a remarkable turnout, with more than 45,000 individuals tuning into the livestream. Among the 500+ in-person attendees were representatives from 26 universities, 75 government officials, and 250 public policy professionals. The summit also garnered attention from over a dozen media outlets. Notably, elected leaders from both major political parties were present, alongside representatives from prominent organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Department, Department of Commerce, Treasury Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).<br><br></p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJeFYsk675k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The summit, with its diverse mix of voices and perspectives, shed light on the pressing need for smart and informed decision-making in the realm of digital asset policy. While Bitcoin symbolizes financial freedom and empowerment, it also brings its fair share of challenges, from concerns about money laundering to energy usage. The summit tackled these complex issues head-on, offering insights into the multifaceted world of Bitcoin as it relates to mining, geopolitics, the future of money, and human rights.<br><br></p><p>The Bitcoin Policy Summit witnessed a significant turnout of policymakers committed to safeguarding the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and addressing its associated challenges. Figures such as Senators Marsha Blackburn, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cynthia Lummis, alongside House members Wiley Nickel, Tom Emmer, and Patrick McHenry, lent their expertise and bipartisan support to the discussions. Their active involvement not only enriched the conversation but also signaled a united effort to ensure that digital asset policies foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold transparency and accountability.<br><br></p><p>One of the most striking features of the summit was its focus on the intersection of Bitcoin and human rights, with speakers like Felix Maradiaga, 2024 Nobel Prize Nominee and prominent human rights advocate from Nicaragua; Anna Chekhovich, financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) founded by Alexei Navalny; Roya Mahboob, Afghan entrepreneur and women's rights advocate; and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian human rights activist. Their combined emphasis on Bitcoin’s critical role in defending human rights and freedom of expression in the face of dictators and oppressive regimes shed light on broader roles for digital assets that many in the United States may not have previously considered.<br><br>Furthermore, the summit stressed the importance of taking a global perspective on digital asset regulation to protect human rights. In a world where digital assets know no borders, fragmented regulatory approaches risk creating loopholes and undermining financial integrity. Human rights activists stressed the need to protect privacy, free speech, and equal access to financial services for all, regardless of where they are.<br><br></p><p>The conference hall buzzed with anticipation as attendees dispersed into three specialized rooms for afternoon deep dive tracks: Mining & Energy, Geopolitics, and Future of Money. Concurrent programming featured keynotes such as “A Climate Scientist’s Perspective on Bitcoin” by Margot Paez, BPI fellow and PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. Fireside chats and panels included "Bitcoin & Financial Inclusion" with Chastity Murphy from the U.S. Treasury, and "Countering Digital Authoritarianism" featuring renowned writer Roger Huang, author of ‘Bitcoin and China’, and Jorge Jrsaissati, President of the Organization for Economic Inclusion.<br><br></p><p>One of my personal highlights from the Bitcoin Policy Summit was engaging in a fireside chat with Senator Marsha Blackburn from my home state of Tennessee. We explored the connection between Bitcoin and her advocacy for consumer rights and privacy. Additionally, we discussed Tennessee's growing prominence as a Bitcoin hub and her stance on CBDCs (spoiler: she’s not a fan). It's truly inspiring to witness elected leaders championing both monetary and digital freedoms, reinforcing their commitment to safeguarding these fundamental rights.<br><br></p><p>Another standout moment occurred during a post-summit dinner with Felix Maradiaga and his wife, Berta Valle. Felix, who endured four years of imprisonment under a Nicaraguan dictator, shared firsthand accounts of political dissent and activism. These experiences underscore the importance of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network, providing resilience against oppression.<br><br></p><p>The 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington D.C. served as a crucial platform for educating policymakers and advocating for Bitcoin's role in shaping a freer and more sustainable financial future. Through candid dialogue, diverse perspectives, and collaborative efforts across sectors, participants witnessed the transformative potential of Bitcoin to advance global human rights, bolster national security, and accelerate renewable energy adoption. As we reflect on the insights garnered from the summit, let's seize this pivotal moment to shape a regulatory landscape that not only fosters innovation and economic growth but also champions human dignity, justice, and liberty.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Stephen Pollock.

While skeptics were quick to mock bitcoin’s near instantaneous selloff in reaction to the news of conflict, ironically bitcoin was one of the only global asset open for trading on the weekend, with equities, commodities, and bond strategists alike turning their eyes to the bitcoin chart in an attempt to assess what the damage might be to global markets upon the Sunday night trading open. </p><p>Turning away from geopolitics, this brief article will take a look at the latest in on-chain spending behavior and Bitcoin derivative markets, to analyze whether the current dip from the highs of $73,000 is typical of a standard bull market correction or more so a cyclical peak.</p><p>Many preconceived notions of a typical Bitcoin cycle have already been shattered with new highs being broken before the upcoming halving taking place on block 840,000. So let's evaluate and take a look at where we are, and how these conditions and investor behavior also inform what might come next.</p><p>We’ll be looking at both on-chain data, to analyze the actions of incumbent Bitcoin hodlers and new market entrants alike, before taking a look at the derivatives market to gauge whether there is anything worrisome in regards to the leverage currently present in the market.</p><figure>

                    <p>First, we’ll take a look at a metric called the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, coined and created by <a href="https://twitter.com/TXMCtrades">TXMC</a>, which compares near-term spending behavior to the yearly average, as a means of detecting overheated and undervalued markets. A brief look at this signals that the bull market is well underway, and may have even peaked.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MTE0MTU5/image2.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        <figcaption><em>The exact calculation of the metric, for those curious, is the ratio of two daily moving averages (30, 365) of Value Days Destroyed (Coin Days Destroyed * Price), then adjusted for supply inflation to account for changes in spender behavior over time.</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>We can attribute approximately one third of the spending as a simple transfer of coins from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to new ETF participants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. However, the raw data is just that—the raw data, and we can see there has been a significant amount of spending that’s occurred with the push to new highs.</p><p>A closer look at the metric, however, shows that this spending activity is cooling off, and there is historical precedent for new highs in the market in both the 2017 and 2021 cycle - this is merely a data point to keep in mind.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MjQ1MjMx/image5.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Next, taking a look at the interplay between HODLers and new entrants, viewed through the lens of short-term and long-term holders, we can see that during a typical bull market, revisits to the cost basis of short-term holders are not only typical but also quite healthy. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MTE0OTQz/image6.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Additionally, the ability for this approximate price level to serve as support is a characteristic of bull markets, with the inverse being true in a bear market, where this psychological level of average short-term holder price (cost basis) often serves as ironclad psychological and technical resistance. As for where that level is today, approximately $58,500, which means that by no means is a visit to this level a guarantee or certainty, but rather it is something that is perfectly in the norm of expected activity in a bull market.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MDQ5NDA3/image3.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Turning our attention to the derivatives market, there has been a healthy flush of leverage and speculative froth across the market. Perpetual futures open in bitcoin terms are near the lowest levels seen since 2022, while futures have been trading at a slight discount to spot markets since the weekend flush lower. While there is no law or guarantee that this brings about higher prices immediately, similar positioning in the past has fostered the conditions for price appreciation, and when compared to the top-heavy speculative froth of a speculative premium in futures market pricing observed over the last month or so, it is a welcomed development. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MzEwNzY3/image7.png" height="800" width="1146">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>In terms of points of interest when eyeing the derivatives landscape, the buildup of liquidatable leverage above $70,000 continues to grow, with emboldened shorts looking to push price meaningfully below $60,000. While there is some leverage to be purged under the $60,000 level, the real prize for bears is under the $50,000 level. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MTc5Njk1/image4.png" height="800" width="1017">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>While certainly crazier things have happened in Bitcoin than a -33% pullback from all-time highs, spot demand is likely to be strong from $50,000, and a wipe of open interest and the start of a negative futures premium relative to spot markets hint at most of the pullback having already taken place. It would likely take a significant risk-off moment across the macro landscape for this to unfold, and any dip is likely to be fleeting given the perpetuating reality of the pace of fiscal deficit spending.</p><p>Conclusion: This bull market has legs, and the current pullback from the highs, along with any future dips in the exchange rate, should be a welcomed development for investors with a sufficiently long time horizon who understand where this is all headed. Bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to improve, and pullbacks serve to purge leverage and weak handed speculators during secular bull markets. </p><figure>

He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute.</p><p>Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you don’t have to disclose your identity to do so, not to mention the process of buying a voucher is quick and easy. Azteco offers both on-chain and Lightning capabilities, giving users the choice to redeem their BTC on either the Bitcoin base chain or the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a>, a Layer 2 payments network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>According to an estimate from Fernandez, over one million people have already purchased Azteco vouchers. But his aspirations are far beyond the already-impressive number of vouchers thus sold: he has his sights set on Azteco servicing a customer base of over 30 times that, as Azteco does its part in “normalizing” Bitcoin.</p><p><em>A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below.</em></p><p><strong>Frank Corva:</strong> Where did the inspiration for Azteco come from?</p><p><strong>Akin Fernandez:</strong> It came from my own experience of finding out that getting bitcoin is very difficult. I realized it doesn't have to be like this. We could use a familiar system like a top-up voucher, which billions of people use to top up their mobile phones, and apply that process to getting bitcoin. All we have to do is build a software, put distribution in place, and then it should just work. And lo and behold, it does.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Did you have a particular customer base in mind when you designed Azteco?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Yes, I had myself in mind. I wanted to be able to get bitcoin without having to make any kind of fuss or effort to do it. I wanted to be able to go to the supermarket, buy $20 worth of bitcoin and put it straight onto my wallet. And I'm not unique. I could assume that there were other people who were like me who could understand the proposition and the ease of use and who would take to it like a duck to water.</p><p>You find that with inventions, many times they come about because people are solving problems for themselves, not as a means to get rich or for any reason other than to solve their own problems. And because people are similar, they solve other people's problems, too.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Speaking of your own experience. I’ve read that you were unbanked for a period of time. Is this true and could you expand on it, if so?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Well, I became unbanked for a reason that I, until this day, don't know. I went down to “my” bank to cash a check, and they couldn't find my account in the system. I had received no communication from them in writing or in any way. All of a sudden, I had no bank account. So, for many years after that I didn't have access to credit cards or anything that other people in the West take for granted.</p><p>This taught me a very, very big lesson about how difficult it is to do anything in the 21st century if you don't have access to banking facilities. You can forget shopping online. You can forget any kind of convenience of going into a store and paying with a card. All of that goes away. </p><p>So, when I was working on Azteco, it was made clear to me how powerful a tool it was going to be, because, with Bitcoin, you cannot be unbanked by any third party. You have control over your synthetic money.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I’ve heard you use this term “synthetic money” before, and you’ve discussed how we shouldn’t refer to bitcoin as actual money. Why is it important that we do this?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> It's important because it's true. Bitcoin is not money — it's a database. Can it be used as money? Of course. It can be used as very, very good money. It's a good simulation of money. But it doesn't have to be money for it to be useful.</p><p>Also, if you call bitcoin money, all the regulations that the state has imposed on actual money can be superimposed or brushed over Bitcoin inappropriately, making it hard to use and slower to spread. So, it's very important to tell the truth about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has taken so long to get into every nook and cranny because there's been this misconstruing of it as money.</p><p>WhatsApp reached a billion people in four and a half years. That's the kind of spread into people's phones that we'd expect if the rails to get onto Bitcoin were frictionless, just like they are with WhatsApp.</p><p>The fact that Bitcoin has not reached that number of people indicates that there's something wrong in the way people are thinking about it, and so it's important for us to think about it correctly.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> How many people is Azteco reaching? Put another way, how many vouchers did Azteco sell in Q3 or Q4 of 2023?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> The actual numbers I don't have at hand being the CEO and not the CFO. But we had our biggest ever month last month. I was told this yesterday. The number of vouchers we're selling is increasing, and this is a direct result of our increasing our distribution and also the sentiment towards Bitcoin changing on a global scale.</p><p>We're the easiest way to get bitcoin. When people discover us, they say two things: “First of all, why isn't everything as easy as this?” and “How come I haven't heard of this before?”</p><p>Things are synergizing and coming together to bring us to a point where we're a global force for good and for getting Bitcoin to the people who need it the most — the unbanked and the people who don't have access to financial rails or people who just don't want to be the victims of the financial rails. </p><p>The old school crop of Bitcoin businesses that have been serving people over the last 10 years all believe that Bitcoin is money and make it very difficult to get an account. Everybody's so inured to the idea of having a bank account or an account of any kind, whether it's through email or anything else. The assumption immediately is, “Well, of course, I have to have an account in order to use this service.”</p><p>With Bitcoin, that's not true, though. No accounts are necessary. [Some] wallet companies are doing this correctly. One of them is Samourai Wallet and another is Wallet of Satoshi where you don’t need to open an account to use your own money.</p><p>They’re saying you shouldn’t be able to use bitcoin without having an account. That’s what they’re trying to do in the EU.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> We’re doing it here in the US with the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Crypto%20AML%20One-Pager_7.26.23.pdf">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA)</a>, too, the bill that Elizabeth Warren drafted.</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> These people are oath breakers. They’ve sworn an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution, which guarantees the free speech of every single American. Bitcoin is speech. It's a database where speech is written down and stored and transmitted from one person to another.</p><p>And lest anyone think that I'm picking on the Democrats and not the Republicans, Cynthia Lummis has written an absolutely appalling <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2281/text">bill</a> that I took great pleasure in <a href="https://medium.com/@beautyon_/unpacking-the-lummis-gillibrand-responsible-financial-innovation-act-6128e6db6a68">tearing to pieces on my blog</a>.</p><p>They don’t understand what their role is as a public servant. A servant is not in control of its masters. A servant is obedient to the electorate. It’s not their business to tell people you have to KYC to use bitcoin.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> On the topic of America and KYC-free bitcoin, do you see people using Azteco because they want KYC-free bitcoin?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> In order for the American market to be cracked, the service has to be explained. People have to be deprogrammed. They don’t understand that bitcoin is not a vehicle to make you earn more fiat.</p><p>People need to be broken out of these bad habits to be shown that actually there are better ways to get things done. The perfect example of this is WhatsApp.</p><p>Before WhatsApp, people used to pay for SMS messages, while the idea of this is now unthinkable. A similar process has to happen with Bitcoin where you can send money to family members without having to go through a third party or pay exorbitant fees or identify yourself or anything like that.</p><p>With Bitcoin, you [also] get other subtle benefits. Hyperinflation is starting to kick in and people are starting to realize that there’s something wrong with the money.</p><p>People find it very difficult to go to the root cause of the prices going up at McDonalds. Let’s say they did find out the cause, what could they do about it? They could go and get bitcoin, but it’s several steps down before these people are going to see bitcoin as the answer.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I agree.</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Also, the current crop of businesses — big businesses like Binance, Coinbase — are synonymous with bitcoin. Azteco needs to be synonymous with getting bitcoin. The vast majority of people on earth are not rich. They don't have $100,000 to spend on bitcoin. They live day to day.</p><p>Since these people are not investors and they don't have spare money to keep in bitcoin in the hopes that it's going to go up — which of course it will — they need to have bitcoin as daily money for everyday spending.</p><p>Once you start talking about these things, the business opportunities and models start to just fall out of the conversation. All of these Cynthia Lummises and Elizabeth Warrens prevent these business models from emerging because they're regulating something they have no business regulating.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Speaking of other businesses, I’ve heard you say good things about <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-machankura-spread-bitcoin-through-africa-feature-phones">Machankura</a>, a protocol that makes it easier for Africans to use bitcoin in a KYC manner, and that it serves as a compliment to Azteco. What other companies in the Bitcoin space are a compliment to Azteco?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Ethical Bitcoin wallets are a good compliment. By ethical, I mean Samourai Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi. I know that some people don’t like Wallet of Satoshi because the architecture on the backend is not to their liking, but these people don’t run businesses — they don’t know how difficult it is to do these things.</p><p>The newest entrant to this is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-releases-bitkey-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-for-pre-order">Bitkey wallet</a>. This Bitkey wallet is absolutely unbelievable. They've thought about this properly. The user interface and user experience — it's going to make everybody change their game.</p><p>I've been saying for a long time that somebody like Apple, Microsoft or some other company is going to get into Bitcoin and bring all of that user experience thinking to the process of using Bitcoin. The current crop of companies have not thought about user experience.</p><p>Jack Dorsey’s Bitkey has been a kick in the backside to a lot of people who realize that we can't just carry on doing what we want to do and expecting people to just accept it — the idea that you have to write down your mnemonic before you receive your first transaction. It’s completely crazy.</p><p>If Apple developed its own Bitcoin wallet or clones one of the Bitcoin wallets out there, Bitcoin is going to be exposed to people in a way that's very easy to understand, very easy to consume. There will be the new generation of Bitcoin users for whom Bitcoin is totally normal — not threatening, intimidating or frightening.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> The same way that using WhatsApp or Uber is normal now…</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> That's exactly right. Bitcoin has to become boring.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"><media:title>azteco_article_preview-v2</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Weekly Reorg: Bitcoin Fashion Week]]></title><description><![CDATA[In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week</guid><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Layer 2]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Bergeron]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 19:13:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week. </p><p>Amongst other things, <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1777771133233742177">Mezo</a>, a “Bitcoin economic layer” came out of stealth with a $21 million fundraising round. <a href="https://twitter.com/AlpenLabs/status/1778080721128599949">Alpen Labs</a> announced a $10.6 million bankroll to bootstrap a Bitcoin-native zero-knowledge infrastructure. </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Another posse of blockchain designers, including the folks at Starkware, got together and launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/L2Ordinals/status/1778453840775553485">L2O Consortium</a> “to set standards for trustless applications and Layer 2s.”<br><br>Of course, nobody knows what this all means, but it’s provocative. It gets the people going, the capital frothing, and the industry buzzing. Eight-figure seed rounds are getting thrown around and some pretty major venture players are making a comeback. Almost every day, a new layer is announced or some “Bitcoin-native” protocol you’ve never heard about announces that its users have locked a bazillion dollars worth of bitcoins into their “trustless” multi-sig protocol. </p><p>So it goes in a bull market, I guess. Curiously, some of the people involved will admit it feels more like performance art than legitimate engineering. Remember the <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1778823151629054147">Rick Owens</a> freak runway shows? It’s flashy alright but who’s going to wear this stuff? </p><p>Keep in mind most of the new gadgets being proposed have yet to take off their training wheels anywhere they’ve been implemented. Rollups on Ethereum, for example, are still just <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1772796987806450121">dressed-up multi-sig</a>. Similarly, this new crop of Bitcoin-adjacent protocol seems content launching with either no product or “decentralization on the roadmap.” Under the layers of vapid marketing and technical mumbo jumbo, it’s hard to find a trust model that is much better than the simple and often maligned Liquid federated sidechain. </p><p>Forget unilateral exit, most of the “Layer 2s” on offer today can hardly qualify for the term under our admittedly loose <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/press-releases/bitcoin-magazine-editorial-policy-on-bitcoin-layer-2s-l2s">policy</a> here at Bitcoin Magazine. </p><p>To make matters worse, variants of proof-of-stake have crept into the design space despite Ethereum’s abysmal performance since its transition. Not surprisingly, the conversation has already devolved into <a href="https://twitter.com/build_on_bob/status/1773010071917642182">ponzinomics</a> to bootstrap the speculative flywheel. Colloquially styled “points,” a new token contraption has burst onto the scene and is all the rage amongst the designer crowd. This new liquidity farming fad requires users to deposit their bitcoins (and those of <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1777876863832191404">friends and family</a>) somewhere in exchange for, you guessed it, yield. </p><p>They’re calling it gamification this time around. I think it’s peak crypto nihilism. Fast fashion has officially made it into Bitcoin!</p><h2>The Emperor Has No Clothes?</h2><p>Speaking of catwalks and clownishly dressed individuals, the crew at Taproot Wizards recently <a href="https://medium.com/@twhittle/bitvm-bridges-considered-unsafe-9e1ce75c8176#:~:text=The%20core%20issue%20with%20BitVM,the%20validators%20burn%20the%20bridge.">unleashed pandemonium</a> on the aspiring Layer 2 community by going at its most prized science project, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field">BitVM</a>. </p><p>My esteemed colleague Shinobi put together a decent <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue">recap</a> of the event. I wont bother you with the technical details but, of course, the claims remain hotly contested to this day. At least a dozen new companies’ fate hangs in the balance here so you can imagine the smell when they were publicly outed to the fashion police. </p><p>Although I’m partial to the wizards’ arguments, we should probably hold off on writing the obituary for BitVM. Jumping through liquidity hoops appears to be one of the pervasive tradeoffs one has to make when designing trust-minimized protocols on top of Bitcoin. Lightning has given us inbound liquidity headaches for years. Proposals like Ark have been dismissed because of the massive UTXOs operators have to fund. Maybe BitVM bridges can be designed to mitigate the upfront liquidity requirements of operators. At least, the issue is probably not enough for everyone to drop everything and go home.</p><p>The unfortunate takeaway from this saga is that everyone involved comes away looking a bit amateurish. Despite <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1776563645738000745">claims to the contrary</a>, some due diligence was clearly skipped. The issue could’ve been run through a bit more collective brain cells before publishing and you can tell the targets all felt pretty blindsided by the announcement.<br></p><p>To tie this all up, the wizards have just come out with their <a href="https://twitter.com/QuantumCatsXYZ/status/1779968142279573583">derivative</a> proposal. It’s hard not to get the impression that this was a bit of a setup motivated by marketing purposes. Then again, they’re grown men wearing wizard hats, what do you expect?<br><br>On the other hand, it is a valid issue and the response from “team” BitVM hasn’t been exactly gracious either. You’d expect thicker skin from researchers who have been around the block. Banning people from a Telegram working group and hand-waving away the entire premise does not serve the interest of the community they are building for. They can disagree with the conclusions but the obvious outcome is that the audience and interest in BitVM have now grown beyond the small engineering circles where it was fomenting. Many have suggested it was probably the first time the mechanism was communicated in an accessible way. It was a missed opportunity for its advocates to leverage this attention and steer it their way if they thought the project was misrepresented. </p><p>Hopefully, this is all just a failed dress rehearsal because I don’t see how this is very inspiring for anyone seriously interested in contributing to this space. <br></p><h2>A grand finale</h2><p>Of course, a circus show isn’t complete without the clown act.</p><p>The hottest protocol designer in town is preparing to showcase his latest line just in time for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-turning-point-counting-down-to-the-most-important-halving-in-history">halving</a> this Friday. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/runes-an-attempt-at-a-serious-protocol-or-another-childrens-toy">Runes</a>, a protocol for fungible tokens, is probably the most anticipated drop since the Jordan 1s. As we speak, <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1775483586885423423">hundreds of users</a> are syncing up Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives in preparation for the festivities. The blockchain is expecting a record crowd for this event so be advised that tickets could get expensive. </p><p>As for myself, I’ll probably just watch from my balcony in the comfort of my safe and ever-reliable Bitcoin jeans. Tick tock, next block.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg"><media:title>default_more_like_a_catwalk_3</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTQ5Nzg0MDYxMDM5/screen-shot-2024-04-16-at-25053-pm.png"><media:title>screen-shot-2024-04-16-at-25053-pm</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin DevCon To Take Place Alongside Bitcoin Asia  ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Asia will see developers from across the globe flock to Bitcoin DevCon, May 7-8. ]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-devcon-to-take-place-alongside-bitcoin-asia-</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-devcon-to-take-place-alongside-bitcoin-asia-</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin DevCon]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Asia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hong Kong]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Events & Conferences 2024]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 18:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0NjQ4MzMxMDQ0NzM1/devon.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In addition to showcasing the world’s most important Bitcoin companies and leaders of today, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for the next generation of Bitcoin startups to meet, build, and get in front of the community.

Its impact is most profound in developing countries, where access to banking still poses a challenge for many. </p><p>Here, Bitcoin serves as more than a currency or an investment; it's a means to engage in essential financial activities, such as sending and receiving money, that would otherwise be out of reach. </p><p>Forget, at least for a minute, the speculative potential in terms of financial gain—the true value of Bitcoin lies in its potential to level the financial playing field, offering access to financial tools that were previously exclusive to those with more established economic backgrounds. </p><p>Amid its fluctuating value, the enduring promise of Bitcoin is its contribution to financial inclusivity, making it a beacon of hope for more equitable access to financial services worldwide.</p><h2>Historical context of Bitcoin and financial inclusivity</h2><p>Bitcoin was born out of the financial turmoil of the late 2000s, with its creator(s) aiming to forge a decentralized currency that could bypass traditional banking systems and help society at large traverse a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. </p><p>This vision was not just technical but deeply ideological, seeking to empower individuals with financial autonomy. </p><p>At its core, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/financial-inclusion/2024/will-2024-see-crypto-make-good-on-its-financial-inclusion-promise/">Bitcoin promised to make financial services accessible</a> to anyone with internet access, regardless of their standing with conventional financial institutions.</p><p>This promise has seen tangible realization in countries like Nigeria, where traditional banking services are out of reach for many. In Nigeria, <a href="https://tokenist.com/nigeria-approves-policy-to-build-a-blockchain-powered-economy/">Bitcoin has become more than a speculative asset</a>—for instance, with the country's significant diaspora, Bitcoin facilitates remittances, enabling Nigerians living abroad to send money home more efficiently and at lower costs compared to traditional banking services. </p><p>In Argentina, Bitcoin has emerged as a crucial financial tool <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin">amidst the country's ongoing economic challenges</a>, including high inflation rates and currency devaluation. For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers a more stable store of value compared to the national currency, the Argentine peso, <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">which has suffered from significant depreciation</a> over the years. </p><p>A similar trend can be noticed in Ghana, where the annual inflation rate is <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghana-s-inflation-slows-but-central-bank-to-remain-cautious-1.2046167">predicted to land in the 13% to 17% range</a> in 2024.</p><p>In Venezuela, a country <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/despite-utility-bitcoin-cannot-fix-venezuela">grappling with political instability and economic crises</a>, Bitcoin has found a unique role beyond just a means of preserving wealth against hyperinflation. Here, Bitcoin is being utilized to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/10/a-rare-glimpse-into-how-crypto-is-really-used-in-venezuela/">support microfinance initiatives and charitable donations</a>, directly impacting the lives of those in need. Organizations and platforms leveraging cryptocurrency can bypass traditional financial systems, which are often inaccessible or unreliable for the country's impoverished populations, to provide direct financial assistance.</p><p>Moreover, for entrepreneurs and small business owners the world over, it offers a means to engage in international transactions without the need for bank accounts or the risk of currency devaluation. It’s both a hedge against crisis and a vessel of freedom against authoritarian regimes, but the decentralization schtick isn’t </p><h2>The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest</h2><p>By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing the digital currency, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-etf-a-decade-of-struggle-for-legitimacy">BTC ETFs offer a familiar, regulated avenue</a> for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin space.</p><p>Previously, the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin deterred many institutional investors. However, with the advent of ETFs and other regulated investment products, these entities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/institutional-investors-may-help-bitcoin-sustain-new-heights-2024-03-05/">can now participate in the cryptocurrency market</a>, bringing with them substantial capital inflows and increased legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, which will only increase with further adoption.</p><p>This institutional foray into Bitcoin has a dual impact. </p><p>On one hand, it introduces a level of stability and liquidity previously unseen, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. </p><p>On the other, it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/will-bitcoin-transform-into-just-another-stock-amidst-institutional-surge-and-etf-integration-">represents a shift from Bitcoin's original ethos</a> of decentralization and democratization of finance. </p><p>Another point to consider is that institutional interest isn’t limited to private, for-profit enterprises—with countries like El Salvador, which recently <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-moves-bitcoin-reserves-to-cold-storage-vault">took custody of its national Bitcoin treasury</a> showcasing that, slowly but surely, the general attitude of governments towards cryptocurrencies is also changing with the times.</p><h2>Potential impacts of institutionalization on accessibility</h2><p>On the one hand, these developments can enhance Bitcoin's appeal by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/stabilizing-forces-how-bitcoin-etf-inflows-counter-price-volatility">contributing to market stability and reducing volatility</a>—a key concern that has deterred a broader demographic from embracing cryptocurrencies. </p><p>The entry of institutional investors can also increase liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially making it a more reliable asset for individuals and businesses worldwide.</p><p>However, the flip side of institutionalization is the potential increase in barriers to entry for marginalized groups. </p><p>The very essence of Bitcoin's appeal to these groups <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-bitcoin-improves-financial-access-and-inclusion-2021-06-21">is its accessibility</a>: the ability to participate in the financial system with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection. As regulatory frameworks become more stringent and the market more institutionalized, the processes for acquiring and using Bitcoin could become more complex. </p><p>Requirements such as rigorous identity verification and compliance with financial regulations, while necessary for fraud prevention and financial security, could inadvertently sideline those without formal identification or those living in regions with less regulatory clarity.</p><p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2023e3.htm">the shift towards institutionalization </a>might lead to a concentration of wealth and power within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reminiscent of traditional financial systems. </p><p>This concentration could undermine the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, making it less about empowering the individual and more about serving institutional interests. </p><p>The challenge lies in finding a balance: leveraging institutional interest to bring stability and legitimacy to Bitcoin while ensuring that its revolutionary promise of financial inclusivity remains intact.</p><h2>Financial inclusion and cryptocurrency adoption</h2><p>Sub-Saharan Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167624523000495">with its blend of limited banking infrastructure and high mobile penetration</a>, has emerged as a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. The region, marked by its smaller overall market size in terms of traditional financial metrics, shows a significantly high level of grassroots cryptocurrency usage. </p><p>Nigeria, for example, not only ranks second on the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Global Crypto Adoption Index</a> but also leads Sub-Saharan Africa in raw transaction volume, as well as the world in P2P exchange trade volume ranking. Other countries like Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa also feature prominently on the index, underlining the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial instruments​</p><p>The adoption is driven largely by practical necessities rather than speculative interests, with cryptocurrencies serving as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. </p><p>In Ghana, where <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/ghana-inflation-hits-record-54-1-as-food-costs-surge">inflation surged to its highest level in two decades</a> at the tail end of 2022, and in other nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa facing similar economic challenges, cryptocurrencies have become an attractive means of preserving wealth. The shift towards digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, and more recently, stablecoins, reflects a broader search for financial stability and freedom​</p><p>Peer-to-peer transactions, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/sub-saharan-africa-a-major-potential-revenue-opportunity-for-digital-payments">especially prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, account for a significant portion of crypto transactions, underscoring the region's unique position in the global crypto landscape. This high rate of P2P transactions is attributed to the everyday use of crypto for retail payments, remittances, and commercial transactions. </p><p>The preference for crypto over traditional banking and financial services is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity in regions where local currencies are losing value, as seen in countries like Nigeria and Kenya​</p><p>Through bypassing traditional financial barriers, cryptocurrencies offer expanded finance options to underserved markets, exemplified by initiatives like <a href="https://empowa.io/">Empowa</a> and <a href="https://pezesha.com/">Pezesha</a> in Mozambique and Kenya that utilize blockchain to facilitate real estate development and connect MSMEs with global lenders.</p><h2>Balancing institutional interest and financial inclusivity</h2><p>As Bitcoin continues to navigate the waters between grassroots empowerment and institutional adoption, its future landscape presents a dichotomy. </p><p>On one side, increased institutional interest brings stability and credibility, potentially making Bitcoin a more viable and trusted financial asset globally. </p><p>On the other, this shift could challenge the very inclusivity that has been a cornerstone of Bitcoin's appeal, particularly among minority groups and in regions with limited access to traditional banking services.</p><p>To ensure that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-advocate-najah-roberts-explains-why-btc-is-a-tool-for-empowerment">Bitcoin remains a tool for empowerment</a>, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential pathway is the development of regulatory frameworks that encourage inclusivity. </p><p>Regulations could be designed to protect consumers <a href="https://fintech.global/globalregtechsummit/crypto-regulation-shouldnt-kill-innovation-but-it-is-needed/">without stifling innovation</a> or access to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the continued support and promotion of peer-to-peer platforms can empower individuals by facilitating direct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As Bitcoin evolves amidst rising institutional interest, its foundational role as an agent of financial inclusivity faces both challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that Bitcoin continues to serve marginalized communities requires a delicate balance, blending the stability brought by institutional involvement with its potential as a democratizing force. </p><p>One thing is certain—the future of Bitcoin hinges in large part on maintaining its essence as a lifeline for financial empowerment across the globe.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

For as long as humans have been organizing into social groups, we’ve been hating on the group in the next valley. Even though we have much more in common with them than we would care to admit.</p><p>It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>These differences aren’t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can’t even recall why they disliked one another in the first place.</p><p>But it wasn’t always that way: and it doesn’t have to stay this way. There are signs that the rivalry that has polarized bitcoiners and ethereans is starting to thaw. If these frenemies can bury the hatchet and work together, it will make web3 a better place for everyone.</p><h3>From Divergence to Convergence</h3><p>It’s easy to forget that Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin cut his teeth at Bitcoin Magazine and was a regular poster on the Bitcointalk forum. When the Ethereum ICO was <a href="https://coincodex.com/ico/ethereum/">held</a> in 2014, funds were raised at a ratio of 2,000 ETH per BTC. It’s also easy to forget that many of the use cases now synonymous with Ethereum have Bitcoin ancestors, such as NFT precursor Colored Coins. Even the concept of a Layer 2 has Bitcoin beginnings. But all that’s ancient history now.</p><p>BTC has assumed the mantle of store of value and global reserve currency, while ETH has become the fuel that launched 100 EVM chains and 10,000 tokens. Along the way, the continental drift pushing the two ecosystems apart has been expedited by Ethereum’s move to Proof of Stake, leaving Bitcoin as the only top 20 coin aside from DOGE still wedded to Proof of Work.</p><p>While the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are stark, they are not irreconcilable. One of the most fascinating aspects of the chains’ evolving use cases is the way in which each has emulated the other. Ethereum is well on its way to becoming a somewhat stable store of value of its own, and looks poised to follow Bitcoin in receiving an ETF.</p><p>Bitcoin, meanwhile, has belatedly spawned its own multi-chain and multi-token ecosystem thanks to Ordinals, BRC20, Runes, Stacks, and similar protocols. Bitcoin-native DeFi and NFTs are now a thing – even if most maximalists aren’t on board. While it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin DeFi takes off, it’s clear that there’s now more that unites the two chains than divides them. Bitcoin and Ethereum have moved in opposing directions over the years but their paths are finally starting to converge.</p><h3>Choose Tech, Not Tribalism</h3><p>Rather than arguing over whose tech trumps whose, or who implemented it first, there are clear benefits to the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities setting aside their differences. Just as globalism diminished petty tribalism (even if we simply swapped hating the guy in the next valley for hating internet strangers), the multi-chain era has rendered blockchain wars pointless.</p><p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer isolated islands but interconnected hubs that routinely exchange value through bridges, portals, and wrappers. Isn’t it time they started swapping developer talent too? The onus is on builders to find ways that both technology stacks can enhance one another. This is the key to scaling web3 and growing adoption.</p><p>The rise of Ordinals has shown there is strong interest in utilizing the Bitcoin network as more than simply a means to store value. But building out further utility natively is complex since the network is not Turing complete by nature and its simplistic UTXO model and limited block space cannot handle complex data and calculations.</p><p>While there have been many avenues explored for scaling Bitcoin, they all relied on a level of centralization until the Taproot upgrade which brought Schnorr Signature and MAST contracts. These upgrades have made it possible to design fully trustless bridges between the Bitcoin ecosystem and other networks, allowing for truly decentralized scaling solutions to be realized.</p><p>The Ethereum ecosystem is already home to a robust suite of tools, smart contracts and applications that can be utilized to bring further compatibility and functionality to Bitcoin. It makes far more sense for Bitcoin to inherit the technology that already exists for certain functions rather than rebuild them from the ground up.</p><h3>Scale Bitcoin, Enhance Ethereum</h3><p>An obvious solution to scaling Bitcoin at the consumer level and building out new use cases is to utilize the functionality enabled by Taproot to create trustless bridges between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks. This can create a wave of new opportunities for both ecosystems by unlocking new ways for Bitcoin holders to engage while increasing the liquidity within Ethereum-based chains.</p><p>While the possibility of utilizing EVM-compatible technology to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem is promising, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome will not be technological but cultural. While human ingenuity is boundless, our tendency to drag one another down like a bucket of crabs remains deeply ingrained.</p><p>All crypto communities should strive to shun the cutthroat behaviors web2 was built on and find ways to collaborate. Only once this is done can web3 realize its full potential. As Biggie put it, “Can’t we just all get along?”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Yves La Rose.

Hong Kong's approval marks a milestone as Asia's first jurisdiction to embrace spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p><p>The ETFs provide exposure to actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, offering investors direct access to the assets. They also present a regulated investment vehicle that mitigates some of Bitcoin's risks.</p><p>By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its Bitcoin-friendly stance amid ongoing efforts to become a finance hub. The accessibly traded funds could stimulate significant retail and institutional demand.</p><p>However, an official SFC announcement remains pending. Some of the social media posts sharing the alleged approval have since been deleted. The opacity around permissions could contribute to market uncertainty in the near term.</p><p>Nonetheless, the reported approvals signal a willingness by Hong Kong's regulators to meet surging investor appetite for Bitcoin. The ETFs' launch will mark a major milestone for Bitcoin adoption and maturity in Asia.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODg3NTQ2MDU4NDM1/scaling-bitcoin-gears-up-for-hong-kong.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODg3NTQ2MDU4NDM1/scaling-bitcoin-gears-up-for-hong-kong.jpg"><media:title>scaling-bitcoin-gears-up-for-hong-kong</media:title><media:text>Op-ed - Scaling Bitcoin Gears up for Hong Kong</media:text></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How did Satoshi Think of Bitcoin?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unchained CSO Dhruv Bansal explores the principles and history that led to Bitcoin's creation and asks the question: "what hath Satoshi wrought"?]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Guides]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Unchained]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3ODkxMjgxNzU3NzI1/bm-x-unchained---how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin----article-preview.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The following is an essay originally published on <a href="https://unchained.com/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a> by <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/author/dhruvbansal/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Dhruv Bansal</a>, CSO and Co-founder of Unchained, the Official US Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine.<strong> </strong><em>For more information on services offered, custody products, and the relationship between Unchained and Bitcoin Magazine, please visit <a href="https://unchained.bitcoinmagazine.com/">our website</a>.</em></p><p><strong><br>Click <a href="https://unchained.com/go/how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">here</a> to <a href="https://unchained.com/go/how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">download a PDF</a> of this 7,000 word essay on the origins of Bitcoin.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1]</p><p>The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology.</p><p>Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T’s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks.</p><p>The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity.</p><p>But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation— it’s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph.</p><p>This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed—and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future.</p><h3>Outline</h3><p><strong>I. </strong>Decentralized systems are markets<br><strong>II. </strong>Decentralized markets require decentralized goods<br><strong>III. </strong>How can decentralized systems price computations?<br><strong>IV.</strong> Satoshi’s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin<br><strong>V. </strong>Conclusion</p><p>A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai’s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts “from exactly that point.” In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin. </p><figure>

                    <h3>How did Satoshi think of bitcoin?</h3><p>Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn’t come out of nowhere.<br></p><p>Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented:</p><ul><li>Digital currencies should be P2P networks</li><li>Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation</li><li>Money is created through an auction</li><li>Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins</li><li>Transactions are batched into blocks</li><li>Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work</li><li>All blocks are stored by all participants<br></li></ul><p>Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn’t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi’s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list.</p><p>Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place?<br></p><p>This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi’s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money.</p><h3>I. Decentralized systems are markets </h3><p>Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words “decentralized” and “distributed” are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces.<br></p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc1ODMyMTEzMzc0NjYx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-65608pm.png" height="530" width="1200">

                    <p>For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">topology of their network diagrams,</a> but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets.</p><h3>Distributed systems rely upon central authorities</h3><p>In this work, we take “distributed” to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as “nodes”) which must communicate, typically over a network.</p><p>Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems.</p><p>But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system.</p><p>Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes.</p><p>The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system.</p><p>Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required.</p><p>In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system.</p><h3>Decentralized systems have no central authorities </h3><p>We take “decentralized” to have a stronger meaning than “distributed”: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for “decentralized” is “peer-to-peer” (P2P). </p><p>Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems:</p><ul><li>Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry—anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority.</li><li>Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage.</li><li>Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert.</li></ul><p>These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of… centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Nakamoto, 2008</em></p></blockquote><p>But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority.</p><p>Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi’s nod to Gnutella, anyone who’s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online.</p><p>Satoshi didn’t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam.</p><h3>Decentralized systems are governed through incentives</h3><p>The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating.</p><p>Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they’re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly.</p><p>The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market’s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system.</p><h3>II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods </h3><p>But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility.</p><p>Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc2ODgxNjk2MDA3NjIx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-80107pm.png" height="763" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true—traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems.</p><p>Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems.</p><h3>Computation is the first decentralized good</h3><p>The first example of a “decentralized good” is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3]</p><p>Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources—they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce.</p><p>The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital “proof” that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given “difficulty” which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority.</p><p>The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called “proof-of-work”.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo’s phrase, “unforgeable costliness”. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource." - Dwoak & Naor, 1993</em></p></blockquote><p>In Dwork & Naor’s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email.</p><p>Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a “pricing function” because, by adjusting the difficulty, a “pricing authority” could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a “price” for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam.</p><p>Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature “pricing function” and “pricing authority” supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource’s controller.</p><p>In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations.</p><h3>Currency is the second decentralized good </h3><p><br>But computations aren’t a good currency.</p><p>The proofs used to “trade” computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can’t be reused for a different input.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc2OTQ1ODUyMDgxNjA1/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-80516pm.png" height="708" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This constraint is useful – it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender’s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can’t be respent for sending a different email.</p><p>But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren’t fungible, they can’t be re-spent,[5] and they don’t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash.</p><p>Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems:</p><p>"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use." - Adam Back, 1997</p><p>We don’t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market.</p><p>Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere “access control mechanism”.</p><p>Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers…in the units of the currency that’s being created!</p><p>Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc2OTk2MzE3OTQ3MzMz/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-80825pm.png" height="652" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency</h3><p>Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints.</p><p>Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it:</p><ol><li>Computations through proof-of-work</li><li>Units of the currency we’re trying to build</li></ol><p>The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy—the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself!</p><p>The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi’s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo’s bit gold and Wei Dai’s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3MDM5MjY3NjIwMzgx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-81100pm.png" height="668" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h3>III. How can decentralized systems price computations?</h3><p>A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency.</p><p>We don’t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called “progress”.</p><p>Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn’t be progress—it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value.</p><p>When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable “prices” and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function.</p><p>But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty— as measured by the number of corresponding computations—may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price?</p><p>Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold:</p><blockquote><p><em>"The main problem…is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract "compute cycle." …Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3MDc1NTA2NDA2OTQx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-81324pm.png" height="767" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the “cost of computing”. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money:</p><blockquote><p><em>'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units." - Dai, 1998<br></em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a “standard basket”, which computer solves a given problem “most economically”, or the cost of computation on the “open market”. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems!</p><p>To be fair to Dai, he realized this:</p><blockquote><p><em>"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol." - Dai, 1998</em></p></blockquote><p>Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let’s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo’s insights into the problem.</p><h3>Use external markets</h3><p>Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be “securely timestamped”:</p><blockquote><p><em>"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases “securely” and “distributed fashion” are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) “outside the system” services for timestamping.[6]</p><figure>

                    <p>Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right—the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was…" - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>"Inferring” the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold…" - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>To paraphrase Szabo, “to assay the value of… bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp”. The dealers defining “larger units of approximately equal value” are providing a similar pricing function as Dai’s “standard basket of commodities”. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger “units of approximately equal value” by dealers in markets outside the network.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money.</p><h3>Use internal markets</h3><p>Szabo’s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it?</p><p>Let’s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi’s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney’s auction model[7]:</p><blockquote><p><em>"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]… instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: </em></p><p>Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures.</p><p>Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on.</p><p>Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation.</p><p>Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly." Dai, 1998</p></blockquote><p>B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo’s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other.</p><p>But implementing Dai’s proposal as written would be challenging:</p><ul><li>In the “Planning” phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the “optimal increase in the money supply for the next period”. How “optimal” should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described.</li><li>Regardless of what was planned, the “Bidding” phase allows anyone to submit a “bid” to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money.</li><li>Once bids are submitted, the “computation” phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it’s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted – when does the “Bidding” phase end and the “computation” phase begin?</li><li>These problems recur in the “Money ]reation” phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of “highest bids”? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency?</li></ul><p>Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented.</p><p>The root of this complexity is Dai’s belief that the “optimal” rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the “macroeconomic calculations” of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create units of b-money by broadcasting a bid and then doing the corresponding proof-of-work. </p><p>Both Szabo and Dai proposed using a market exchanging digital currency for computations yet neither bit gold nor b-money defined a monetary policy to regulate the supply of currency within this market.</p><figure>

                    <h3>IV. Satoshi’s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin</h3><p>In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi’s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust." - Satoshi, 2009</em></p></blockquote><p>Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks—with a concern about monetary policy. </p><p>Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The “optimal” rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. </p><p>This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi “discovered” bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. —and not someone else. It’s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply.</p><p>A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It’s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai’s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. </p><p>Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let’s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint.</p><h3>All 21M bitcoin already exist</h3><p>In b-money, each “money creation period” included a “Planning” phase, in which users were expected to share their “macroeconomic calculations” justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi’s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project.</p><p>Satoshi was able to replace the recurring “Planning” phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi’s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. </p><p>This changes the semantics of bitcoin’s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it’s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. </p><p>This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that “bitcoin miners create bitcoin”. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they’re buying it. Bitcoin isn’t valuable because “bitcoin are made from energy”—bitcoin’s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. </p><p>Let’s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn’t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3NTkzMzE4NDAxNDc3/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-84533pm.png" height="549" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Satoshi’s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing “Planning” phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Bitcoin is priced through consensus</h3><p>This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the “Bidding” phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation “bids” from many different users. </p><p>Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn’t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi’s predetermined schedule. </p><p>The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8]</p><p>The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi’s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3NjE3NDc3NTkyNTE3/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-84705pm.png" height="453" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section):</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3NjMxNDM2MjM2MjI5/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-84748pm.png" height="448" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price.</p><p>Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus “blockchain” containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain.</p><p>Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy – just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented.</p><p>This added complexity was removed by Satoshi’s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy.</p><h3>Time closes all spreads</h3><p>In the “Computation” phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they’d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller – but who is the buyer?</p><p>In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. </p><p>In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. </p><p>The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner’s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. </p><p>Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to “execute a trade” but to pay the current asking price in computations. </p><p>The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid—the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network’s current asking price.</p><blockquote><p><em>To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008</em></p></blockquote><p>Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin’s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let’s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. </p><p>Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn’t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn’t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. </p><p>But Satoshi’s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. </p><p>Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo’s “secure timestamping protocol.” Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a “distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,” and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world “timechain” rather than “blockchain” to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin’s proof-of-work market.[10]</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3Njg4MDc2MTE3NDQ1/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-85128pm.png" height="728" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Bitcoin’s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time.</p><h3>A standing order creates consensus </h3><p>The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the “Money creation” phase of b-money. </p><p>User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from “nothing at stake” problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the “highest bids…in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created” in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. </p><p>This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the “Byzantine generals” or sometimes the “double-spend” problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem – socalled “Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms”—require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially.</p><p>Bitcoin doesn’t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network’s current asking price— nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner’s resources. </p><p>Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin’s market has no phases—it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network.</p><p>This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] </p><p>We established in previous sections that bitcoin’s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! </p><p>Moreover, this new “Nakamoto consensus” only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing.</p><h3>IV. Conclusion</h3><p>B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi’s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin’s implementation.</p><p>There is a lot more to bitcoin’s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the “primary” market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. </p><p>The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.</p><figure>

As we’ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. </p><p>[6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. </p><p>[7] Dai’s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi’s white paper, available: <a href="http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt">http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt </a></p><p>[8]There are two simplifications being made here: <br>a. The number of bitcoin being sold in each block is also affected by the transaction fee market, which is out of scope for this article, though lookout for subsequent work.<br>b.

How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny.</p><blockquote><p>“Thiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.” – <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank#:~:text=Using%20stock%20deals%20unavailable%20to,the%20end%20of%202018%3A%20%2439%2C108.">ProPublica</a> (2021)</p></blockquote><p>Let’s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures.</p><h2>The different IRA structures</h2><p>The different IRA structures can behave in an “every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares” kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njg5OTQwMDA3MjAwMjg1/group-2085664027.png" height="630" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Brokerage and Bank IRAs</h3><p>Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained IRA</a> is closest to this structure in this hierarchy.</p><h3>Self-directed IRA (SDIRA)</h3><p>A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn’t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-investments-faqs">are not allowed</a> (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.).</p><h4>Checkbook IRA</h4><p>Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term “checkbook IRA” is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (“checkbook control”). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA.</p><h4>Non-checkbook self-directed IRA</h4><p>A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).</p><figure>

                    <h2>Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA</h2><h4>1. Liquidity</h4><p>Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy.</p><h4>2. Formation and legal structure</h4><p>When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account.</p><p>With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA.</p><h4>3. Misreporting transactions</h4><p>Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions.</p><p>At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit <a href="https://www.iraresources.com/blog/how-to-report-the-fmv-of-your-self-directed-ira#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20self,total%20value%20of%20your%20IRA.">fair market valuation (FMV)</a> information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law.</p><h4>4. “Deemed distribution” treatment</h4><p>Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of “deemed distributions” treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA</a>. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC’s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her “unfettered control” over the LLC’s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA.</p><p>It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying “deemed distribution” treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/">IRS Publication 590</a>, it’s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/">Read more about the McNulty case and its implications</a>.</p><h4>5. Prohibited transactions</h4><p>All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. “Self-dealing” is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself—not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide “sweat equity.”</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njg5OTQ4MzI4Njk5NDIx/jessy_webinar_image-prev3-1.png" height="668" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>It’s not only the IRA owner that can’t participate in any “self-dealing,” but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-prohibited-transactions">penalties are stiff.</a> These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don’t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">IRS list of prohibited transactions here</a>.</p><p>Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors:</p><ul><li>Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets</li><li>Leverage without a non-recourse loan</li><li>Investing in certain collectible NFTs1</li></ul><h4>6. Financing</h4><p>Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases.</li><li>Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits.</li><li>IRA-owned active businesses could run into the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax">issue of UBIT</a> (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-iras-tax-implications/">mining within an IRA</a>.</li><li>Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA’s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs.</li></ul><h2>What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs?</h2><p>The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls.</p><h2>Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA</h2><p>If you’re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It’s not a “checkbook IRA” where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations.</p><p>There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.</p><p><em>This article is provided for educational purposes only, and cannot be relied upon as tax advice.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. </p><p>Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it’ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time – adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. </p><p>The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope – ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it’s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the <em>experience</em> of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). </p><p>Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal’s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. </p><p>When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription <em>4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0</em> is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction <em>4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079</em>. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions – but don’t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network – we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we <em>do </em>broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork – presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we’ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. </p><p>Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can’t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) “Layer Connector” that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs!</p><p>With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: </p><ul><li>Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes)</li><li>A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per “layer” (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.)</li><li>The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the “Dispatcher”. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. </li><li>The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code</li></ul><p>In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. </p><p>Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn’t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. </p><p>Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can’t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the “parent”. In order for miners to capture the fees from this “child” transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. </p><p>One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10’s or 100’s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we’d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would:</p><ul><li>look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate</li></ul><ul><li>Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel</li><li>Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address</li><li>Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped</li><li>It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions</li></ul><p>We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the “split” transaction here:<a href="https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f"> https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f</a> Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb.</p><p>The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn’t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas.</p><p>Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. </p><p>There are other aspects of the project that we haven’t covered here – how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one’s easy: it’s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rijndael.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event.</p><h3>What is Bitcoin halving?</h3><p>The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors.</p><h3>Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem</h3><p>The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin.</p><h2>Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients</h2><h3>Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC</h3><p><strong>1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving?</strong></p><p><em>As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving.</em></p><p><strong>2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p><em>The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving.</em></p><p><strong>3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards?</strong></p><p><em>I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I’ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future.</em></p><p><strong>4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</strong></p><p><em>Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren.</em></p><p><strong>5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price</strong></p><p><em>When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that’s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry.</em></p><p><strong>6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</strong></p><p><em>I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs.</em></p><h3>Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO</h3><p><strong>1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a "hodling" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs</p><p><strong>2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p>After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo</p><p>fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate.</p><p><strong>3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives.</p><p><strong>4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</strong></p><p>Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment.</p><p><strong>5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving</strong></p><p>In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success.</p><p><strong>6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</strong></p><p>Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively.</p><h2>Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell</h2><h3>Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving</h3><p><strong>Efficiency is Key:</strong> Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem.<br></p><p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances.</p><p><strong>Diversifying Revenue Streams:</strong> Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols.</p><p><strong>Adapt and Evaluate: </strong>Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards.</p><p><strong>Collaborative Mining: </strong>Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards.</p><p><strong>Leverage Mining Solutions:</strong> Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p>The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network.</p><p><br></p><p> After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards?<br></strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include:</p><ol><li><strong>Mining Altcoins: </strong>While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue.</li><li><strong>Mining Pools and Services:</strong> Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects.</li><li><strong>Hardware Sales and Leasing: </strong>Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations.</li><li><strong>Staking and Masternodes:</strong> Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees.</li><li><strong>Blockchain Development and Consulting:</strong> Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting.</li><li><strong>Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments:</strong> Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies.</li><li><strong>Energy Trading and Grid Services:</strong> Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs.</li></ol><p>Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential.</p><ol><li>Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</li><li>Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price</li><li>Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings</li><li>Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving</li><li>Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</li></ol><p>Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions:</p><ol><li><strong>Price Volatility: </strong>Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics.</li><li><strong>Speculative Activity:</strong> Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions.</li><li><strong>Market Sentiment: </strong>Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines.</li><li><strong>Miner Behavior:</strong> The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics.</li><li><strong>Macro-Economic Factors: </strong>External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Outlook:</strong> Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest.</li></ol><p>While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved.</p><p><strong>Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition?</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Efficiency Improvements: </strong>One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs.</li><li><strong>Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing:</strong> Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability.</li><li><strong>Vertical Integration: </strong>Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams.</li><li><strong>Diversification of Revenue Streams:</strong> As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments.</li><li><strong>Hedging Strategies: </strong>Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement and Governance:</strong> Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability.</li></ol><p>Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Keaton Reckard.

<h2>Gold Throughout the Ages</h2><p>One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a “fine man’s suit” over time. This principle, known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga.<br><br>While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man’s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges.<br><br>For example, the cost of verification – or assaying – gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value.<br><br>Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/examining-decisions-that-lead-to-bitcoin">”Nixon Shock”</a> in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good.<br><br>This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-">Executive Order 6102</a> comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited “the hoarding of gold coin”, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven?</h2><p>Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals.</p><p>As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years – reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-store-of-value">store of value</a> better than gold, it is certainly promising. This “magic internet money” continues to rapidly gain on gold’s estimated <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">$15.9 trillion market capitalization.</a></p><h2>Gold’s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally</h2><p>Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals.<br></p><p>Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-work">proof of work</a> and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/the-infosec-basics-how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-seed-phrase-secure">informational nature</a>, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute.<br></p><p>Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/fully-noded-the-basics-and-benefits-of-running-a-bitcoin-node">Bitcoin’s network of nodes</a> and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified.

                    <p>As Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China.</p><p>Hong Kong’s new <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/as-hong-kong-approaches-in-kind-bitcoin">ETF</a> has been in the making for several months now, and it’s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it’s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF’s total assets under management (AUM) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hong-kongs-largest-bitcoin-etf-assets-up-five-fold-since-october-2024-02-29/">already</a> passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it’s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market.</p><p>Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong">big players</a> from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media <a href="https://www.stcn.com/article/detail/1167888.html">reported</a> that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Considering that there are already signs of <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-177-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b1855bff6f4e">diminishing</a> ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn’t Bitcoin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/">banned</a> in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/">report</a> $90 billion worth of transactions in one year?</p><figure>

                    <p>Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/02/05/china-never-completely-banned-crypto/">many</a> windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: “If you get scammed, don’t expect our help or sympathy." Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions.</p><p>It’s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it’s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they’ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/chinese-partnership-to-bring-large">invested</a> heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that’s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. </p><figure>

                    <p>Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong’s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin’s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? </p><p>As far as Hong Kong’s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kongs-za-bank-to-offer-custody-accounts-for-stablecoin-issuers/">banks</a> shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. <em>The South China Morning Post</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3258196/hong-kongs-hashkey-crypto-exchange-launches-global-platform-aim-overtaking-coinbase-5-years">reported</a> on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new “Global” initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to “overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years." A very tall order. </p><p>And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the <em>Post</em> that “We have seen their data and we don’t think that’ll be difficult”. He added that most global competitors are either “easy to use but not compliant”, or “compliant but hard to use”, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It’s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/08/hashkeys-crypto-exchange-goes-live-after-winning-license-in-bermuda/">offer</a> nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. </p><p>This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business’ reigning champs won’t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/web3-festival-attracts-smaller-crowd-093000150.html">reportedly</a> mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city’s own existing firms are confident that they’ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? </p><p><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=author-post-insert&utm_source=bmpro"></a></p><p>It’s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It’s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"><media:title>default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzOTc0NTEzOTc2Nzcz/553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833.jpg"><media:title>553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/eastern-asia-cryptocurrency-adoption/?ref=blockhead.co">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png"><media:title>bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em>Click the image to learn more.</em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin startups raised $301 million through all of last year alone.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report</guid><category><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Report]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Start Up]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a> (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. </p><p>Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxODM3NDQ3MjI2OTA5/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am.png" height="669" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxOTQwNzk0ODc3Mzgx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am.png" height="671" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>“The early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for ‘crypto’ venture’s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,” said Calicott. “With a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.”</p><p>In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyMTI0NjczMTY0NzQx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am.png" height="674" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>“Due to cyclicality and bitcoin’s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,” Calicott continued. “Despite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.”</p><p>TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.</p><p>The full TVP Bitcoin startup ecosystem research brief is available for <a href="https://tvp.fund/whitepapers/bitcoin-venture-capital-research/">download</a>, offering a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape and investment opportunities in Bitcoin-native technologies.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg"><media:title>default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxODM3NDQ3MjI2OTA5/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxOTQwNzk0ODc3Mzgx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyMTI0NjczMTY0NzQx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wall Street Is Buying US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: 13F SEC Fillings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Major Wall Street institutions like Park Avenue Securities and Inscription Capital bought into spot bitcoin ETFs in Q1 according to just-released SEC 13F filings.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wall-street-is-buying-us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-13f-sec-fillings</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wall-street-is-buying-us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-13f-sec-fillings</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 11:50:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3Nzg2NjEyNzU0MTE1/bitcoin-etf-delayed-but-wall-street-has-on-ramps.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest 13F filings with the SEC reveal that major institutional investors have been acquiring shares in the new spot <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">bitcoin ETFs</a> that launched this quarter.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: Wall Street firms with a combined $15 BILLION in AUM bought exposure to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETFs in Q1<br><br>This is just the beginning 💥 <a href="https://t.co/MQ1TZp8tQp">pic.twitter.com/MQ1TZp8tQp</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1778373845243625633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, which rebranded from Cobo Vault in June 2021, has been producing crypto wallets since February 2018. The company first launched a bitcoin-only firmware in 2020 and has now released an overhauled version of the firmware after taking into consideration feedback from its customers.</p><p>“Since day one, we have been listening closely to the Bitcoin community, trying our best to develop the most secure hardware wallet,” Keystone CEO Lixin Liu told Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>“Upon receiving feedback from the community, we rewrote our embedded system using Rust, often considered the least prone to bugs, and open sourced every line of the code, allowing users to scrutinize and verify the firmware integrity anytime,” he added.</p><p>The new firmware also supports security-oriented features like Shamir Backup implementation and the import of three different seed phrases.</p><p>And not only is the new firmware more secure, but the Keystone 3 Pro itself was also designed with security in mind. The device is air-gapped, contains three Secure Element chips and comes with a built-in self-destruct mechanism that erases all stored private keys if it detects physical tampering. It also enables users to create a seed phrase without having to pair it with any native software first, eliminating the potential risk of the private key being extracted through the software.</p><p>“In addition to security upgrades, we've focused on improving usability,” Liu told Bitcoin Magazine. </p><p>Liu highlighted how the firmware seamlessly operates with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners-part-three-installing-blue-wallet">Blue Wallet</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners-part-four-installing-sparrow-wallet">Sparrow Wallet</a>, and <a href="https://nunchuk.io/">Nunchuk</a> as well as how the Keystone 3 Pro has a 4-inch color touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, which makes signing into the device more convenient. He also shared that the battery life for the device is over 20 times greater than that of its predecessor. </p><p>The Keystone 3 Pro is currently retailing for $129 on the company's website, Amazon, and Newegg.</p><p>“We've kept our product affordable without compromising product quality, UX, and security,” Liu added.</p><p>You can learn more about the Keystone 3 Pro <a href="https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-3pro">here</a> and Keystone's bitcoin-only firmware <a href="https://keyst.one/btc-only">here</a>.

This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. </p><p>Let’s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHUcaTHqrY8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions</h2><p>Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back.</p><p>The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how:</p><ul><li><strong>KYC Compliance:</strong> All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings.</li><li><strong>Transaction History: </strong>Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions.</li><li><strong>Reporting to IRS: </strong>Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains.</li><li><strong>Legal Precedents:</strong> The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions.</li></ul><p>Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly.</p><p>Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season.</p><p>To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments.</p><h2>Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same</h2><p>The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. </p><p>The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year.</p><figure>

                    <p>If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income.</p><p>Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin—bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. </p><p>With that as a backdrop, let’s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. </p><h2>Strategies and Case Studies</h2><h2>Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy</h2><p>Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn’t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. </p><p>When accounting for transactions, it’s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. </p><p>The IRS allows for “specific identification” accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item—in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong><em> Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000.</em></p><ul><li><em>With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000).</em></li></ul><ul><li>With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000).</li></ul><ul><li>HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case.  </li></ul><p><em>These would be short-term capital gains, so let’s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. </em></p><p>It’s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly.</p><h2>Tax loss harvesting</h2><p>Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we’ll leave it here for future readers. </p><p>In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong><em> </em><em>Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved.</em></p><p>Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the <strong>tax loss carry forward</strong> technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains.</p><p>If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. </p><h2>Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket</h2><p>A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. </p><p>For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain’t so bad. Sign me up. I’ll even pay it twice. </p><p>And “taxable income” is calculated <strong>after</strong> the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single).</p><p><strong><em>Scenario: </em></strong><em>Let’s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their </em><strong><em>bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free)</em></strong><em>. And we’ll assume that they live in</em><em> one of the nine US states</em><em> that don’t have an income tax, so let’s call it 0% state tax as well.</em></p><p><strong>It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free—</strong>valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a <strong>strategic sell and immediate rebuy</strong> opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. </p><p>Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting.</p><p>Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). </p><p>The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting.</p><p>A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/102715/pros-and-cons-creating-backdoor-roth-ira.asp">Roth IRA conversions</a> or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/property-sale-installment-payment.asp">liquidating assets through installment sales</a>.</p><h2>Gifting</h2><p>We’ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people.</p><h3>Charity</h3><p>When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed.</p><p><em><strong>Scenario</strong>: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he’d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains.</em></p><p>You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. </p><p>“But I don’t want to have less bitcoin!”</p><p>If bitcoin holders are familiar with “spend and replace,” we can consider a similar strategy like “donate and replace.” You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes.</p><h3>Donor-advised funds</h3><p>For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a "charitable savings account": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time.</p><p>Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications.</p><h3>Friends and family</h3><p>Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. </p><p>Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you).</p><p><em><strong>Scenario:</strong> A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their “lifetime bucket.” Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. </em></p><h2>Roth accounts</h2><p>Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability.</p><p>If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings.</p><p>If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you.</p><p>With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort.</p><h2>A note on wash sales</h2><p>The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin.</p><p>Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended.</p><p>Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit.</p><p>It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency.</p><p><em>1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events.</em></p><p><em>2)</em> These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. </p><blockquote><p><br>CONTACT<br>Office: (208)-254-0142<br>408 South Eagle Rd.<br>Ste. 205<br>Eagle, ID 83616<br>hello@thesoundadvisory.com<br><br>Check the background of your financial professional on FINRA's <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/">BrokerCheck</a>.

<p>The story of "My Trust In You Is Broken" revolves around the Block Size Wars era in 2017, particularly BitPay's advocacy for SegWit2x, which would have increased Bitcoin's block size limit. Seeing this, Dorier was motivated to create BTCPay Server in defiance of this centralized control, empowering merchants to accept Bitcoin directly on their own, promoting decentralization and independence from intermediaries.</p><p>The documentary, spanning 42 minutes, sheds light on the importance of verifying transactions and the risks associated with trusting third parties blindly. It showcases BTCPay Server's journey from its inception in 2017, highlighting its evolution into a community-driven platform known for its privacy and autonomy features.</p><figure>

In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. </p><p>Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. </p><p>Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. </p><p>By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250—a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-btc-all-time-high-70k">briefly touched $70,000</a> recently. </p><p>With this kind of growth, it’s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to “HODL" until it reaches new price highs. </p><p>However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. </p><p>As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. </p><p>What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC? Bitcoin loans offer a solution that provides access to liquidity without letting go of your holdings. </p><p>How does a Bitcoin loan work? Here, we delve into the unique mechanics of a <a href="https://unchained.com/loans-consultation">Bitcoin loan</a>. We discuss how the world’s leading cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the world of finance beyond trading by providing alternative means to secure loans while retaining access to potentially higher returns in the future. </p><figure>

                    <h2>Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending</h2><p>Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. </p><p>You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments—similar to how a bank operates. </p><p>Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent—thus becoming overcollateralized loans. </p><h2>How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan</h2><p>A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. </p><p>The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. </p><p>Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. </p><p>The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings.</p><h2>Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan</h2><p>Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: </p><h3>Risks associated with rehypothecation</h3><p>Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. </p><p>Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties.</p><p>With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral—or even 100 percent—is at risk. </p><p>Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. </p><p>Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on.</p><h3>Annual percentage rate (APR)</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp">annual percentage rate, also known as the APR</a>, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. </p><p>In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. </p><p>The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. </p><p>A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. </p><h3>LTV requirement</h3><p>The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates.</p><p>Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. </p><h3>Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV)</h3><p>The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. </p><h3>Tax implications</h3><p>Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. </p><p>The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. </p><p>Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. </p><p>Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best. </p><figure>

                    <h2>What are the benefits of Bitcoin loans?</h2><p>Bitcoin-backed loans offer several advantages, especially for long-term holders. The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don’t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification.</p><p>Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. </p><h2>Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin</h2><p>Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. </p><p>Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. </p><p>Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. </p><p>As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Is it the JPEG People? Or is it the Laser-Eyed Maxis? Or is it both? </p><p>The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it’s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don’t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. </p><p>You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn’t have that, you likely didn’t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. </p><p>That dogma was necessary — without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn’t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. </p><p>Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. </p><figure>

                    <h2>Which Church Do You Go To?</h2><p>The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn’t die — it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn’t destroy it — they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. </p><p>The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther’s famous Theses. </p><p>What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. </p><p>This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. </p><p>That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. </p><p>They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. </p><p>Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. </p><h2>The Protestants’ Disgust With Indulgences</h2><p>So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let’s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences — the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, “As soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs”. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. </p><p>“Just follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.” Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they’re undeniable. </p><p>In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that “this one simple trick” is enough to guarantee an individual’s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can’t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. </p><p>It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It’s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. </p><p>Here’s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn’t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people — roughly the same size as the Catholic population — Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. </p><p>And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther’s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one’s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn’t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. </p><figure>

                    <h2>Dissent Breeds Dissent</h2><p>Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn’t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it’s simply a matter of survival. </p><p>And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single “Protestant” dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. </p><p>We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as “against” the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as “doing what the Laser Eyes couldn’t” as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around “owning the Laser Eyes”. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. </p><p>That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? </p><p>The JPEG People claim they are here to “make Bitcoin fun again”, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to “own the Laser Eyes”. That doesn’t produce anything of value. That doesn’t actually inspire people with a vision. </p><p>Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own. </p><p>So what is the identity of the JPEG People without Laser Eyes to troll? Is there even one there when you take that away? </p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Inscription Issue”.

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the “liquidity crunch” issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. </p><p>Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it’s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. </p><p>As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator <em>has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state</em> they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. </p><p>So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they’ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network.</p><h2>The Liquidity Crunch</h2><p>The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator’s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. </p><p>For now let’s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they <em>should</em> have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. </p><p>It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they <em>have</em> processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. </p><p>This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users’ money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? </p><h2>The Options</h2><p>The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. </p><p>So now that we understand the problem let’s look at some potential solutions. </p><h3>Throttling</h3><p>You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. </p><p>The problem with this is you don’t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don’t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. </p><p>This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. </p><h3>Multiple Operators</h3><p>Both BitVM 1 and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field">BitVM 2</a> support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator’s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. </p><p>This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator.</p><p>It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren’t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. </p><h3>Multiple Linear Operators</h3><p>In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. </p><p>This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. </p><h3>The Backstop</h3><p>In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. </p><p>Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users’ funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist.</p><p>So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users’ funds and make them whole. I don’t think this is that bad. </p><p>Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. </p><p>That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. </p><p>I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users’ funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. </p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users’ funds, to losing operators’ funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. </p><p>It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I’ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. </p><p>As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"><media:title>bitvm2bridge</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The U.S. Needs To Lead in Bitcoin, Says Congressman Patrick McHenry]]></title><description><![CDATA[The United States Representative says that cash is king in illicit finance and that Bitcoin is a bastion of freedom.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-us-needs-to-lead-in-bitcoin-says-congressman-patrick-mchenry</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-us-needs-to-lead-in-bitcoin-says-congressman-patrick-mchenry</guid><category><![CDATA[Patrick McHenry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Us Congressman]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:27:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjE5MjgyNDI2NDcxODc3/screenshot-2024-04-09-at-102504am.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="https://www.btcpolicysummit.org/">Bitcoin Policy Summit</a> in Washington DC today, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) emphasized the importance of the United States taking a leadership role in Bitcoin and not lagging behind in during a fireside chat with Club for Growth President David McIntosh.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Congressman Patrick McHenry says the US needs to be a leader in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> 👏 <a href="https://t.co/jC20GaurXe">pic.twitter.com/jC20GaurXe</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1777703772694667444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"This is where the action is, this is a bastion of freedom," McHenry stated when asked why he was speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Summit this morning. "The way I view Bitcoin is — what Satoshi brought into this world has been unstoppable. Every regime that has tried to shut it down as failed, even the Chinese communist party that tried to shut down Bitcoin couldn't. And so it is an unstoppable piece of technology."</p><p>McHenry, known for his advocacy of financial innovation and technology, emphasized the need for his collogues in office to become educated on Bitcoin, acknowledging the challenges of regulating this technology with uninformed policy makers.</p><p>"The dumbest way to try to obscure your transactions are to do them in public," McHenry explained. "And the level of embarrassment when senators and members of the house ask questions about this on how to obscure these transactions. And when you have to explain to them that this is an open ledger that people can see the movement of value, and they don't understand that...Cash is still king in illicit finance."  </p><p>The congressman further highlighted how "it is a much easier conversation" to have with fellow politicians if they were to read the Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto before coming together to legislate. McHenry said that the lack of understanding of Bitcoin amongst policy makers has resulted in them going down rabbit holes of misinformation. And that causes them to speak in truths while legislating, based off of that information.</p><p>Overall, McHenry's message at the Bitcoin Policy Summit reflected a sense of urgency and opportunity, urging the United States to embrace its potential as a leader in the Bitcoin revolution and chart a course for a dynamic and innovative future in finance and technology.</p><p>"I'm trying to convince policy makers on the hill to embrace and for the United States to be leaders in, rather than fall behind. And I want to make sure you all hear that message clearly," Congressman McHenry said.</p><p>For more information about the annual Bitcoin Policy Summit, including the full agenda and list of speakers, visit BPI’s website <a href="https://www.btcpolicysummit.org/">here</a>.

One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. </p><p>While listening to a <a href="https://whatbitcoindid.libsyn.com/bitcoin-satoshis-vision-with-dhruv-bansal-wbd786">recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal</a> they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. </p><p>I really liked Dhruv’s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows:</p><h3>Version 1: The Commonly Held View</h3><p>The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you’d describe this is “6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.” </p><h3>Version 2: Dhruv’s View</h3><p>ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term “released” to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term “unlocked” for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv’s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv’s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. </p><h2>Why is Dhruv’s framing important? </h2><p>By framing mining as <em>buying</em> coins rather than <em>creating</em> coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? </p><p>If miners are <em>creating</em> bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an "inefficiency of scale" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! </p><p>Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *<em>purchasing</em>* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. </p><p>Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don’t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets</h2><p>Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. </p><p>Layer zero is what I’d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin <em>that already exist</em> to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn’t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. </p><p>Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a “two sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.” The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price <em>collectively</em> for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. </p><p>There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers “wins the auction” using Dhruv’s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES.</p><p>The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, “Each of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says ‘what were the most recent bids in time?’ and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.” </p><p>The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users <em>and</em> the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] </p><h2>What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero?</h2><p>What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says “it’s computations for bitcoin.” Layer 0 is a “market between two aggregates.” It’s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two “participants” in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. </p><p>Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation <em>and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work</em>.</p><p>The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? </p><p>Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think “how wasteful," think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv’s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. </p><p>There are some who believe that transaction costs won’t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. </p><p>The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. </p><p>In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. </p><p>Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. </p><p>For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future. </p><p>Special thanks to Dhruv Bansal for providing constructive input on this article. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia.

This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything?</p><p>If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I’m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. </p><p>To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. </p><p>It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. </p><h2>Verifying Things Yourself</h2><p>When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network’s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network</p><p>Most people likely don’t care about other people’s bitcoin payments, if you aren’t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. </p><p>Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. </p><p>When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. </p><h2>The Supply Cap</h2><p>The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not <em>the</em>, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. </p><p>All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. </p><p>Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. </p><h2>Keeping Your Bitcoin Private</h2><p>Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. </p><p>When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else’s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. </p><p>If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. </p><p>Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. </p><h2>Why This is All Important</h2><p>While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits.</p><p>Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don’t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. </p><p>Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. </p><p>Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else’s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. </p><p>Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network. Once you have your keys safely secured, it is absolutely important that you take this next step. </p><p>Here are some wallets and tools to help you in that process:</p><p><a href="https://bitcoincore.org/">Bitcoin Core</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/gain-full-sovereignty-run-your-own-bitcoin-node-with-ledger-satstack">Ledger Satstack</a></p><p><a href="https://fullynoded.app/">Fully Noded</a></p><p><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a></p><p><a href="https://specter.solutions/desktop/index.html">Specter Wallet</a></p><p><a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a></p><p><a href="https://runcitadel.space/">Citadel</a></p><p><a href="https://ronindojo.io/">Ronin Dojo</a></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTk0ODk4ODIzMzkwMjgy/ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTk0ODk4ODIzMzkwMjgy/ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Despite Criticism, Lightning Network Continues Seeing Major Rollouts ]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a “dead end” as capacity drops.

                    <p>Bitcoin’s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. </p><p>The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin’s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it’s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador’s government <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/27/bitcoins-lightning-network-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/">uses</a> Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. </p><p>Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-doesnt-work">multiple</a> defenses of Lightning’s long-term <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/lightning-is-doomed">viability</a> as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a “silver bullet” to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-lightning-network-major-challanges">grew</a> to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users’ money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. </p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/02/are-bitcoin-developers-losing-faith-in-lightning/">question</a> if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly <a href="https://protos.com/critics-claim-buggy-bitcoin-lightning-network-is-slowly-dying/">quit</a> the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes <a href="https://twitter.com/truthcoin/status/1719388665107947959">both</a> the protocol’s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, “everyone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people” to Lightning, a “microscopic” amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, “almost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it” amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning’s future prospects has <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281529/lightning-networks-us-dollar-capacity-surges-to-all-time-high-as-bitcoin-capacity-falters">emerged</a>, as the network’s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/lisa-neigut-reinventing-lightning-to-reinvent-bitcoin/">optimism</a> and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-receives-1-5m-funding-to-expand-bitcoin-lightning-network-in-southeast-asia">secured</a> $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes.</p><p>This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/largest-us-crypto-exchange-coinbase-to-integrate-the-bitcoin-lightning-network">finalized</a> a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange’s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark’s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. </p><p>The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to “inscribe” unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-nintendo-64-emulator">inscribe</a> discontinued video games. </p><figure>

                    <p>This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bug-fix-expected-to-halt-btc-ordinals-and-brc-20-tokens-says-bitcoin-dev/">claimed</a> that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a “vulnerability” in Bitcoin, one that is being “exploited... to spam the blockchain." The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/bitcoin-fees-spike-during-ordinals">linked</a> to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to “fix” this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals’ continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance <a href="https://decrypt.co/224788/binance-nft-marketplace-axes-bitcoin-ordinals">quoted</a> their “ongoing efforts to streamline product offerings” as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. </p><p>The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning’s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin’s usability, while Ordinals’ critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin’s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it’s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. </p><p>And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr’s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/09/bitcoin-developers-proposal-to-stop-spam-nfts-gets-shut-down/">rejected</a> by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/franklin-templeton-ordinals-renaissance-bitcoin-nft-innovation">endorsed</a> Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a “renaissance” in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin’s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain’s flexibility and superiority over its competitors.

Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin’s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It’s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it’s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTg1NDQ2NjMxMzI0/default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTg1NDQ2NjMxMzI0/default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1.jpg"><media:title>default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTMzMzcwMTUyODYw/a706054e-ae71-459b-8f39-dca89b41f8da_1600x1089.jpg"><media:title>a706054e-ae71-459b-8f39-dca89b41f8da_1600x1089</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/lightning-network-capacity/">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTUxODkyMTk5MzI0/f06af934-7229-4fc7-84ce-94b35939f7e0_4000x2637.jpg"><media:title>f06af934-7229-4fc7-84ce-94b35939f7e0_4000x2637</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Download the full 20-page research report prepared by <a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester">Tuur Demeester</a> (Founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamantResearch">Adamant Research</a>) for <a href="https://twitter.com/unchainedcom">Unchained</a>.]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China's Largest Funds Apply for Spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong]]></title><description><![CDATA[Major Chinese asset managers like Harvest Fund and Southern Fund are leveraging Hong Kong subsidiaries to apply for Bitcoin ETFs.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 11:02:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTgyODkzMTc2NzQ5NjMwODgz/img_5987.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of China's biggest asset managers are using Hong Kong subsidiaries to enter the Bitcoin ETF market, according to recent reports.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇨🇳 $284 billion China Southern Fund has reportedly applied to launch spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF via Hong Kong.<br><br>You can&#39;t stop an idea whose time has come 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/rnHOuRoY7V">pic.twitter.com/rnHOuRoY7V</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1777270610139238847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

The halving (also known as the “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-halvening">Halvening</a>”) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the “block subsidy”) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin’s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. .</p><h2>WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING?</h2><p>The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period — or epoch — will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. </p><h3>TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE</h3><ol><li>Determine the block interval: While it’s true that Bitcoin’s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments.</li><li>Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you’re running one.</li><li>Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin’s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height.</li><li>Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving.</li><li>Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected.</li></ol><p>Current block height: can be found <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc">here</a>.</p><p>Block time: can be found <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y">here</a>. </p><p>Current date: xx/xx/xxxx</p><p>Blocks per epoch: 210,000</p><p>Next halving block height: 210,000 <em>times</em> next halving number</p><p>Calculation: </p><p>(((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining</p><p>Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it’s important to keep running the calculation.</p><h2>HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS</h2><figure>

These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events.</p><ul><li>After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162.</li><li>After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800.</li><li>After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000.</li></ul><p><em>Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years.</em></p><figure>

                    <h3>Challenges for Miners</h3><p>Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network’s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin’s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. </p><h2>FAQs:</h2><p><strong>Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? </strong></p><p>Bitcoin’s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin’s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it’s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling.</p><p><strong>Is Bitcoin halving bullish?</strong></p><p>The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it’s wise to remember that bitcoin’s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. </p><p><strong>How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak?</strong></p><p>A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. </p><p><strong>Should you buy bitcoin before the halving?</strong></p><p>Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it’s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTc5OTk5NTk0Mzk2/when-bitcoin-halving-16x9.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTc5OTk5NTk0Mzk2/when-bitcoin-halving-16x9.png"><media:title>when-bitcoin-halving-16x9</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTczODI1NzA5OTgw/unnamed-1.png"><media:title>unnamed-1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTU4MjU2MzIxNjEw/unnamed.png"><media:title>unnamed</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[National Emergency: Executive Order 6102 and the Heist of the Century]]></title><description><![CDATA[A comprehensive history of the events leading up to the historic Executive Order 6102 under FDR that led to widespread gold confiscation in the United States. ]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-</guid><category><![CDATA[April 5th]]></category><category><![CDATA[Executive Order 6102]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[6102]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Julian Fahrer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI3MzQ0MzU2NTMzNjQx/default_the_6102_gold_confiscation_0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Ninety-one years ago today, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history.</p><p>Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead.</p><p>On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.<sup>1</sup></p><p>EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. </p><p>As such, it’s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners’ interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it’s <em>the</em> quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it’s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody.</p><p>Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn’t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. </p><p>Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there’s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don’t pay your taxes.</p><p>For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again.</p><p>However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on <em>why</em> FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR’s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that “without his New Deal, we would all have been lost.”<sup>2</sup></p><p>On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and “accustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.”<sup>3</sup></p><p>All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is <em>how</em> FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. </p><p>This is because, despite the fact that FDR’s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America’s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), “rule by personal decree”<sup>4</sup>, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher.</p><p>This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans’ rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. </p><p>If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. </p><h2>The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency</h2><p><em>“Now, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes” </em></p><p><em>- Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses</em></p><p>I’m not sure anyone’s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole <em>not been Machiavellian enough</em>, but in this case the historical record is clear. </p><p>Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), ‘disregarding the laws for good objects’ has been practically a job requirement of the oval office.</p><p>Carl Schmitt said that “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit ‘extra-constitutional’ exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt’s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice.</p><p>In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp.</p><p>The phrase is “national emergency”. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you’re an American adult, it’s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the ‘anti-terrorism’ provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19.</p><p>In fact, it’s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the ‘national emergency’ has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 <em>National Emergencies Act</em>. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.<sup>5</sup></p><figure>

                    <p>But still, the story goes deeper. It’s not <em>just</em> enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn’t the case in 1933.</p><p>So what was FDR’s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold?</p><p>The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first.</p><h2>The Beginning: Principled Piracy</h2><p>In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia.</p><p>About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the <em>Rapid,</em> to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the<em> Jefferson</em>, who claimed the ship’s goods as a prize.</p><p>Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the <em>Jefferson</em>. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. </p><p>The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was “trading with the enemy”, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.<sup>6</sup></p><p>Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. </p><p>“But”, (I hear you interject), “By what definition could an ‘American with gold’ be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn’t even a war in 1933!” Fantastic points, and you’re right to make them. </p><p>To preface the answer, let’s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major ‘philosophies’ that you might subscribe to. </p><p>Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn’t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these ‘philosophies’ help judges decide the ‘right’ way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that’s another story).</p><p>If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the ‘meaning’ of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A ‘Living Constitution’ approach: where you basically say, ‘to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today’.</p><p>The third approach is more or less how the law around ‘national emergencies’ has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate ‘natural selection’ evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast.</p><p>So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. </p><p>Now let’s fill in the gaps and show how that happened.</p><h2>1917: National Emergencies Go Up</h2><p>There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five.</p><p>One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the <em>Espionage Act, </em>was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today.</p><p>This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under.</p><p>1917 was also the first time the phrase “national emergency” passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America’s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.<sup>7</sup> Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin’ violation. </p><p>This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. </p><p>Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since <em>The Rapid</em>, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle.</p><p>The solution was the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em>, which brought the principle of <em>The Rapid</em> into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to “define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.”<sup>8</sup> In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.<sup>9</sup></p><p>Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, “perhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.”<sup>10</sup> This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives.</p><p>For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.<sup>11</sup></p><figure>

                    <p>This was all authorized by the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em>. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story.</p><p>That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in “foreign exchange”, or by any foreign country.<sup>12</sup></p><p>You might sense now that we’re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness.</p><p>But we’re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President’s power in 1917 was still limited to “during the time of war.”<sup>13</sup></p><p>It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it.</p><h2>Great Depression: FDR’s Opportunity</h2><p>That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis.</p><p>Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank’s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would “no longer take responsibility” for the bank’s “deficient reserves”.<sup>14</sup></p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a ‘gold standard’ was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.<sup>15</sup></p><p>The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI2ODExMjQzNzE3Nzc3/image1.jpg" height="800" width="800">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government’s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. </p><p>Meanwhile, “all of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.”<sup>16</sup></p><p>FDR’s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. </p><p>He called out the “unscrupulous money changers”, and the “falsity of material wealth”, and demanded that “there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.”<sup>17</sup></p><p>Now, if you’ve been paying attention, you shouldn’t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a “broad Executive power to <em>wage a war against the emergency</em>, as great as the power that would be given to me if <em>we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe</em>.”<sup>18</sup></p><p>It was all downhill from there.</p><p>Two days after FDR’s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a ‘Bank Holiday’ from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the “hoarding”.<sup>19</sup></p><p>Stopping the run wasn’t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting “the names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.”<sup>20</sup></p><p>On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate “any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.”<sup>21</sup></p><p>Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em> restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR’s inaugural address, the <em>Emergency Banking Act</em> (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality.</p><p>Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce “during time of war”, or crucially, “during <em>any other period of national emergency declared by the President</em>.”</p><p>FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. </p><p>By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: “HOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty”<sup>22</sup></p><p>This brings us to the end of the story. From <em>The Rapid</em>, to the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em>, to the <em>Emergency Banking Act</em>, to Executive Order 6102. </p><p>The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. </p><p>This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn’t.</p><h2>Conclusion: Could It Happen Again?</h2><p>Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin?</p><p>Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI2ODExMjQzNzE4MDI1/image2.jpg" height="676" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn’t control; Government wasn’t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff.</p><p>The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024.</p><p>This isn’t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either.</p><p>The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. </p><p>Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. </p><p>History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. </p><p>What does the next national emergency look like? </p><p>A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities<sup>23</sup> trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? </p><p>We don’t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate.</p><p>In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>’s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff.</p><p>Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a <em>chance</em> at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation.</p><p>So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>And see you in hell, FDR.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p><sup>1 </sup>Executive Order 6102, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102</a></p><p><sup>2 </sup>Shlaes, Amity, <em>The Forgotten Man</em>, Introduction</p><p><sup>3 </sup>Shlaes, Amity, <em>The Forgotten Man</em>, Introduction</p><p><sup>4 </sup>Mencius Moldbug, March 19 2010, <em>The true election: a practical option for political change, <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2010/03/true-election-practical-option-for-real/">https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2010/03/true-election-practical-option-for-real/</a></em></p><p><sup>5 </sup>List of national emergencies in the United States, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States</a></p><p><sup>6 </sup>The Rapid, 12 U.S. 155 (1814), <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/12/155/">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/12/155/</a></p><p><sup>7 </sup>Proclamation 1354, <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-1354-emergency-water-transportation-the-united-states">https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-1354-emergency-water-transportation-the-united-states</a></p><p><sup>8 </sup>Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917</a></p><p><sup>9 </sup>The Secret Life of Statutes: A Century of the Trading with the Enemy Act, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-american-history/article/secret-life-of-statutes-a-century-of-the-trading-with-the-enemy-act/77DD7CF528D3190CFC8CF8FF6DDAACB0#fn68">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-american-history/article/secret-life-of-statutes-a-century-of-the-trading-with-the-enemy-act/77DD7CF528D3190CFC8CF8FF6DDAACB0#fn68</a></p><p><sup>10 </sup>Congressional Record — House, July 9 1917, 4842, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1917/07/09/house-section">https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1917/07/09/house-section</a></p><p><sup>11 </sup>The U.S. Confiscated Half a Billion Dollars in Private Property During WWI, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/</a></p><p><sup>12 </sup>Trading with the Enemy Act 1917, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf</a></p><p><sup>13 </sup>Trading with the Enemy Act 1917, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf</a></p><p><sup>14 </sup>Bank Holiday of 1933, <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bank-holiday-of-1933">https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bank-holiday-of-1933</a></p><p><sup>15 </sup>‘Roosevelt's Gold Program’, <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts-gold-program">https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts-gold-program</a></p><p><sup>16 </sup>FDR’s Second Fireside Chat, <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/may-7-1933-fireside-chat-2-progress-during-first-two-months">https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/may-7-1933-fireside-chat-2-progress-during-first-two-months</a></p><p><sup>17 </sup>First Inaugural Address of Franklin D.

<p><a href="https://gryphondigitalmining.com/">Gryphon Digital Mining</a> uses <a href="https://www.carbonchain.com/">CarbonChain</a>, an organization that monitors corporate carbon emissions, to track its carbon footprint. CarbonChain’s <a href="https://gryphondigitalmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gryphon-Digital-MiningFY23_1-Oct-2022-30-Sep-2023.pdf">recent report</a> on Gryphon shows that the company has used 100% renewable energy to mine bitcoin thus far in 2024 and 98% renewable energy in 2023, as per Scope 1 and 2 of the report.</p><p>“We’re 100% renewable, and we’re showing you exactly how it’s calculated,” Gryphon Digital Mining CEO Rob Chang told Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>“And we’re not even the ones calculating it. It’s a respected third party doing it,” he added.</p><p>“There are various levels of transparency that the industry needs, but the fact that the reporting is not uniform can be fixed and should be fixed — and we’re happy to lead the way.”</p><p>Gryphon currently conducts all of its mining through a hosting contract with <a href="https://www.coinmint.one/">Coinmint</a> at a facility located in upstate New York that harnesses 100% hydroelectric power for its operations. While bitcoin mining operations have <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">caused electricity prices to spike</a> in some upstate New York towns, Gryphon’s operation is having the opposite effect.</p><p>“Our location is in an economic <a href="https://esd.ny.gov/opportunity-zones">Opportunity Zone</a>, so, if anything, there isn’t much demand [for power] competing against us,” Chang told Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>“In fact, the existence of bitcoin mining is providing economic power deployment for the region, because it is actually a stable consumer of power that allows the economic delivery of more power to the area,” he added.</p><p>Gryphon is looking to expand its operations into other jurisdictions that have supportive regulations around bitcoin mining and that offer favorable economics for mining as well as renewable energy to power its facilities.</p><p>“If it’s economic and carbon neutral, we’re there,” said Chang.</p><p>For more information on Gryphon, please visit the company’s <a href="https://gryphondigitalmining.com/">website</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk4MzEzOTk0ODMyODQ4NDMw/alcoa-lake.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk4MzEzOTk0ODMyODQ4NDMw/alcoa-lake.png"><media:title>alcoa-lake</media:title><media:text>Painting an image of a Bitcoin mining operation with an artist hand.</media:text></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Spot Bitcoin ETF to launch in Australia, Says Monochrome]]></title><description><![CDATA[Monochrome plans to launch Australia's first spot bitcoin ETF holding physical BTC, pending approval from Cboe Australia expected by mid-2024.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/first-spot-bitcoin-etf-australia-this-summer</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/first-spot-bitcoin-etf-australia-this-summer</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 14:02:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI0NzQ0MDIyMjcxMzY5/group-3689-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian asset manager Monochrome plans to launch the nation's first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds physical bitcoin.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN:  🇦🇺 The first <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> spot ETF in Australia to go live &quot;in 2024,&quot; asset manager Monochrome says.<br><br>It would be the first Australian ETF to hold <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> directly. <a href="https://t.co/x8nYRNzZra">pic.twitter.com/x8nYRNzZra</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1776214544597053463?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Monochrome filed an application with securities exchange Cboe Australia to list its flagship bitcoin ETF product. The firm expects approval by mid-2024.</p><p>Unlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States.</p><p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application.</p><p>"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024," said CEO Jeff Yew. "The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly."</p><p>If approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia.</p><p>The firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform.</p><p>Australia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures.</p><p>The fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI0NzQ0MDIyMjcxMzY5/group-3689-1.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI0NzQ0MDIyMjcxMzY5/group-3689-1.png"><media:title>group-3689-1</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
