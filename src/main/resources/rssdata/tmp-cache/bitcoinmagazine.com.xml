<p>In considering the logic behind Bitwise and VanEck’s decision to donate to developers who maintain and update the Bitcoin protocol, it’s difficult to imagine why more spot Bitcoin ETF issuers haven’t followed suit.</p><p>“While we use the language of ‘donation’ when we support devs, I think in reality it's closer to a self-investment into making the asset itself stronger,” Hong Kim, co-founder and CTO of Bitwise, wrote in an <a href="https://stacker.news/items/454701?commentId=454764">AMA thread on Stacker News</a>. “Many people think Bitcoin just magically gets maintained, but that's not true! If you manage a large pool of Bitcoin and you take fees for doing so, then why would you not reinvest some of that into the underlying infrastructure?”</p><p>For this reason, Bitwise, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name <a href="https://bitwiseinvestments.com/newsroom/the-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-bitb-begins-trading">Bitwise Bitcoin ETF</a> (ticker: BITB), committed to donating 10% of its ETF fee profits to three different nonprofits that fund Bitcoin Core developers — <a href="https://opensats.org/">OpenSats</a>, <a href="https://brink.dev/">Brink</a> and the <a href="https://hrf.org/programs/financial-freedom/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> — for 10 years.</p><p>“Brink, OpenSats and HRF were the most established nonprofits with a track record of funding Bitcoin devs — they had the proof of work, so to speak,” Kim told Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>VanEck, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name <a href="https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/bitcoin-trust-hodl/overview/">VanEck Bitcoin Trust</a> (ticker: HODL), also sees the value in supporting Bitcoin Core developers.

How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny.</p><blockquote><p>“Thiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.” – <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank#:~:text=Using%20stock%20deals%20unavailable%20to,the%20end%20of%202018%3A%20%2439%2C108.">ProPublica</a> (2021)</p></blockquote><p>Let’s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures.</p><h2>The different IRA structures</h2><p>The different IRA structures can behave in an “every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares” kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Brokerage and Bank IRAs</h3><p>Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained IRA</a> is closest to this structure in this hierarchy.</p><h3>Self-directed IRA (SDIRA)</h3><p>A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn’t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-investments-faqs">are not allowed</a> (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.).</p><h4>Checkbook IRA</h4><p>Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term “checkbook IRA” is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (“checkbook control”). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA.</p><h4>Non-checkbook self-directed IRA</h4><p>A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).</p><figure>

                    <h2>Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA</h2><h4>1. Liquidity</h4><p>Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy.</p><h4>2. Formation and legal structure</h4><p>When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account.</p><p>With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA.</p><h4>3. Misreporting transactions</h4><p>Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions.</p><p>At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit <a href="https://www.iraresources.com/blog/how-to-report-the-fmv-of-your-self-directed-ira#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20self,total%20value%20of%20your%20IRA.">fair market valuation (FMV)</a> information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law.</p><h4>4. “Deemed distribution” treatment</h4><p>Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of “deemed distributions” treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA</a>. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC’s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her “unfettered control” over the LLC’s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA.</p><p>It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying “deemed distribution” treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/">IRS Publication 590</a>, it’s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/">Read more about the McNulty case and its implications</a>.</p><h4>5. Prohibited transactions</h4><p>All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. “Self-dealing” is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself—not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide “sweat equity.”</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njg5OTQ4MzI4Njk5NDIx/jessy_webinar_image-prev3-1.png" height="668" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>It’s not only the IRA owner that can’t participate in any “self-dealing,” but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-prohibited-transactions">penalties are stiff.</a> These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don’t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">IRS list of prohibited transactions here</a>.</p><p>Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors:</p><ul><li>Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets</li><li>Leverage without a non-recourse loan</li><li>Investing in certain collectible NFTs1</li></ul><h4>6. Financing</h4><p>Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases.</li><li>Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits.</li><li>IRA-owned active businesses could run into the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax">issue of UBIT</a> (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-iras-tax-implications/">mining within an IRA</a>.</li><li>Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA’s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs.</li></ul><h2>What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs?</h2><p>The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls.</p><h2>Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA</h2><p>If you’re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It’s not a “checkbook IRA” where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations.</p><p>There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.</p><p><em>This article is provided for educational purposes only, and cannot be relied upon as tax advice.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. </p><p>Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it’ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time – adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. </p><p>The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope – ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it’s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the <em>experience</em> of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). </p><p>Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal’s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. </p><p>When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription <em>4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0</em> is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction <em>4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079</em>. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions – but don’t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network – we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we <em>do </em>broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork – presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we’ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. </p><p>Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can’t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) “Layer Connector” that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs!</p><p>With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: </p><ul><li>Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes)</li><li>A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per “layer” (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.)</li><li>The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the “Dispatcher”. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. </li><li>The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code</li></ul><p>In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. </p><p>Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn’t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. </p><p>Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can’t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the “parent”. In order for miners to capture the fees from this “child” transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. </p><p>One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10’s or 100’s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we’d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would:</p><ul><li>look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate</li></ul><ul><li>Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel</li><li>Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address</li><li>Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped</li><li>It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions</li></ul><p>We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the “split” transaction here:<a href="https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f"> https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f</a> Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb.</p><p>The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn’t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas.</p><p>Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. </p><p>There are other aspects of the project that we haven’t covered here – how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one’s easy: it’s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rijndael.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event.</p><h3>What is Bitcoin halving?</h3><p>The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors.</p><h3>Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem</h3><p>The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin.</p><h2>Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients</h2><h3>Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC</h3><p><strong>1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving?</strong></p><p><em>As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving.</em></p><p><strong>2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p><em>The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving.</em></p><p><strong>3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards?</strong></p><p><em>I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I’ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future.</em></p><p><strong>4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</strong></p><p><em>Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren.</em></p><p><strong>5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price</strong></p><p><em>When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that’s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry.</em></p><p><strong>6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</strong></p><p><em>I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs.</em></p><h3>Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO</h3><p><strong>1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a "hodling" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs</p><p><strong>2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p>After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo</p><p>fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate.</p><p><strong>3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives.</p><p><strong>4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</strong></p><p>Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment.</p><p><strong>5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving</strong></p><p>In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success.</p><p><strong>6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</strong></p><p>Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively.</p><h2>Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell</h2><h3>Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving</h3><p><strong>Efficiency is Key:</strong> Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem.<br></p><p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances.</p><p><strong>Diversifying Revenue Streams:</strong> Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols.</p><p><strong>Adapt and Evaluate: </strong>Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards.</p><p><strong>Collaborative Mining: </strong>Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards.</p><p><strong>Leverage Mining Solutions:</strong> Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p>The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network.</p><p><br></p><p> After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards?<br></strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include:</p><ol><li><strong>Mining Altcoins: </strong>While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue.</li><li><strong>Mining Pools and Services:</strong> Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects.</li><li><strong>Hardware Sales and Leasing: </strong>Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations.</li><li><strong>Staking and Masternodes:</strong> Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees.</li><li><strong>Blockchain Development and Consulting:</strong> Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting.</li><li><strong>Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments:</strong> Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies.</li><li><strong>Energy Trading and Grid Services:</strong> Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs.</li></ol><p>Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential.</p><ol><li>Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</li><li>Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price</li><li>Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings</li><li>Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving</li><li>Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</li></ol><p>Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions:</p><ol><li><strong>Price Volatility: </strong>Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics.</li><li><strong>Speculative Activity:</strong> Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions.</li><li><strong>Market Sentiment: </strong>Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines.</li><li><strong>Miner Behavior:</strong> The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics.</li><li><strong>Macro-Economic Factors: </strong>External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Outlook:</strong> Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest.</li></ol><p>While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved.</p><p><strong>Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition?</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Efficiency Improvements: </strong>One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs.</li><li><strong>Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing:</strong> Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability.</li><li><strong>Vertical Integration: </strong>Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams.</li><li><strong>Diversification of Revenue Streams:</strong> As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments.</li><li><strong>Hedging Strategies: </strong>Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement and Governance:</strong> Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability.</li></ol><p>Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Keaton Reckard.

At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions.<br></p><figure>

                    <p>To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events:</p><p><strong>November 28, 2012:</strong> Bitcoin’s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block.</p><p><strong>July 9, 2016: </strong>The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block.</p><p><strong>May 20, 2020:</strong> The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block.</p><p>The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch — a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years – will see Bitcoin’s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">~94% of the total <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days 👀<br><br>Digital scarcity at its finest 🚀 <a href="https://t.co/fjbLs1tq7r">pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1777351422431862829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h2>Gold Throughout the Ages</h2><p>One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a “fine man’s suit” over time. This principle, known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga.<br><br>While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man’s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges.<br><br>For example, the cost of verification – or assaying – gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value.<br><br>Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/examining-decisions-that-lead-to-bitcoin">”Nixon Shock”</a> in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good.<br><br>This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-">Executive Order 6102</a> comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited “the hoarding of gold coin”, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven?</h2><p>Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals.</p><p>As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years – reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-store-of-value">store of value</a> better than gold, it is certainly promising. This “magic internet money” continues to rapidly gain on gold’s estimated <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">$15.9 trillion market capitalization.</a></p><h2>Gold’s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally</h2><p>Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals.<br></p><p>Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-work">proof of work</a> and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/the-infosec-basics-how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-seed-phrase-secure">informational nature</a>, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute.<br></p><p>Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/fully-noded-the-basics-and-benefits-of-running-a-bitcoin-node">Bitcoin’s network of nodes</a> and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin’s rise as a monetary good – predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable – has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold’s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement.<br><br>While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time.<br><br>Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it’s Bitcoin’s time to shine.<br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjY0NzIzOTg1NzY5OTI1/ledger-10-steps--quality-money---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjY0NzIzOTg1NzY5OTI1/ledger-10-steps--quality-money---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps--quality-money---article-preview</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjY2MTM4MzcyMTg3Njc3/ledger---10-steps---quality-money---social.png"><media:title>ledger---10-steps---quality-money---social</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjY0NzQ3MDcxMjE5MjI5/image2.png"><media:title>image2</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;m=market.MarketcapUsd&amp;s=1539194432&amp;u=1712620800&amp;zoom=">Glassnode</a>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chinese Financial Institutions Turn to Hong Kong’s New Bitcoin ETF ]]></title><description><![CDATA[With Hong Kong asset managers somewhat reluctant to submit applications for the new ETF, a series of multibillion-dollar firms from Mainland China have entered the market. ]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chinese-financial-institutions-turn-to-hong-kongs-new-bitcoin-etf-</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin ETF]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine Pro]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hong Kong]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Landon Manning]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter.

                    <p>As Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China.</p><p>Hong Kong’s new <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/as-hong-kong-approaches-in-kind-bitcoin">ETF</a> has been in the making for several months now, and it’s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it’s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF’s total assets under management (AUM) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hong-kongs-largest-bitcoin-etf-assets-up-five-fold-since-october-2024-02-29/">already</a> passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it’s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market.</p><p>Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong">big players</a> from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media <a href="https://www.stcn.com/article/detail/1167888.html">reported</a> that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Considering that there are already signs of <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-177-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b1855bff6f4e">diminishing</a> ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn’t Bitcoin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/">banned</a> in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/">report</a> $90 billion worth of transactions in one year?</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzOTc0NTEzOTc2Nzcz/553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833.jpg" height="667" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/02/05/china-never-completely-banned-crypto/">many</a> windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: “If you get scammed, don’t expect our help or sympathy." Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions.</p><p>It’s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it’s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they’ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/chinese-partnership-to-bring-large">invested</a> heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that’s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. </p><figure>

                    <p>Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong’s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin’s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? </p><p>As far as Hong Kong’s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kongs-za-bank-to-offer-custody-accounts-for-stablecoin-issuers/">banks</a> shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. <em>The South China Morning Post</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3258196/hong-kongs-hashkey-crypto-exchange-launches-global-platform-aim-overtaking-coinbase-5-years">reported</a> on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new “Global” initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to “overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years." A very tall order. </p><p>And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the <em>Post</em> that “We have seen their data and we don’t think that’ll be difficult”. He added that most global competitors are either “easy to use but not compliant”, or “compliant but hard to use”, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It’s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/08/hashkeys-crypto-exchange-goes-live-after-winning-license-in-bermuda/">offer</a> nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. </p><p>This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business’ reigning champs won’t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/web3-festival-attracts-smaller-crowd-093000150.html">reportedly</a> mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city’s own existing firms are confident that they’ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? </p><p><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=author-post-insert&utm_source=bmpro"></a></p><p>It’s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It’s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"><media:title>default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzOTc0NTEzOTc2Nzcz/553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833.jpg"><media:title>553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/eastern-asia-cryptocurrency-adoption/?ref=blockhead.co">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png"><media:title>bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em>Click the image to learn more.</em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin startups raised $301 million through all of last year alone.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report</guid><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Start Up]]></category><category><![CDATA[Report]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a> (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. </p><p>Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxODM3NDQ3MjI2OTA5/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am.png" height="669" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxOTQwNzk0ODc3Mzgx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am.png" height="671" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>“The early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for ‘crypto’ venture’s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,” said Calicott. “With a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.”</p><p>In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyMTI0NjczMTY0NzQx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am.png" height="674" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>“Due to cyclicality and bitcoin’s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,” Calicott continued. “Despite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.”</p><p>TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.</p><p>The full TVP Bitcoin startup ecosystem research brief is available for <a href="https://tvp.fund/whitepapers/bitcoin-venture-capital-research/">download</a>, offering a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape and investment opportunities in Bitcoin-native technologies.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg"><media:title>default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxODM3NDQ3MjI2OTA5/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxOTQwNzk0ODc3Mzgx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyMTI0NjczMTY0NzQx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wall Street Is Buying US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: 13F SEC Fillings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Major Wall Street institutions like Park Avenue Securities and Inscription Capital bought into spot bitcoin ETFs in Q1 according to just-released SEC 13F filings.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wall-street-is-buying-us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-13f-sec-fillings</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wall-street-is-buying-us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-13f-sec-fillings</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 11:50:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3Nzg2NjEyNzU0MTE1/bitcoin-etf-delayed-but-wall-street-has-on-ramps.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest 13F filings with the SEC reveal that major institutional investors have been acquiring shares in the new spot <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">bitcoin ETFs</a> that launched this quarter.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: Wall Street firms with a combined $15 BILLION in AUM bought exposure to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETFs in Q1<br><br>This is just the beginning 💥 <a href="https://t.co/MQ1TZp8tQp">pic.twitter.com/MQ1TZp8tQp</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1778373845243625633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, which rebranded from Cobo Vault in June 2021, has been producing crypto wallets since February 2018. The company first launched a bitcoin-only firmware in 2020 and has now released an overhauled version of the firmware after taking into consideration feedback from its customers.</p><p>“Since day one, we have been listening closely to the Bitcoin community, trying our best to develop the most secure hardware wallet,” Keystone CEO Lixin Liu told Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>“Upon receiving feedback from the community, we rewrote our embedded system using Rust, often considered the least prone to bugs, and open sourced every line of the code, allowing users to scrutinize and verify the firmware integrity anytime,” he added.</p><p>The new firmware also supports security-oriented features like Shamir Backup implementation and the import of three different seed phrases.</p><p>And not only is the new firmware more secure, but the Keystone 3 Pro itself was also designed with security in mind. The device is air-gapped, contains three Secure Element chips and comes with a built-in self-destruct mechanism that erases all stored private keys if it detects physical tampering. It also enables users to create a seed phrase without having to pair it with any native software first, eliminating the potential risk of the private key being extracted through the software.</p><p>“In addition to security upgrades, we've focused on improving usability,” Liu told Bitcoin Magazine. </p><p>Liu highlighted how the firmware seamlessly operates with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners-part-three-installing-blue-wallet">Blue Wallet</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners-part-four-installing-sparrow-wallet">Sparrow Wallet</a>, and <a href="https://nunchuk.io/">Nunchuk</a> as well as how the Keystone 3 Pro has a 4-inch color touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, which makes signing into the device more convenient. He also shared that the battery life for the device is over 20 times greater than that of its predecessor. </p><p>The Keystone 3 Pro is currently retailing for $129 on the company's website, Amazon, and Newegg.</p><p>“We've kept our product affordable without compromising product quality, UX, and security,” Liu added.</p><p>You can learn more about the Keystone 3 Pro <a href="https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-3pro">here</a> and Keystone's bitcoin-only firmware <a href="https://keyst.one/btc-only">here</a>.

This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. </p><p>Let’s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies.</p><h2>Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions</h2><p>Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back.</p><p>The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how:</p><ul><li><strong>KYC Compliance:</strong> All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings.</li><li><strong>Transaction History: </strong>Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions.</li><li><strong>Reporting to IRS: </strong>Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains.</li><li><strong>Legal Precedents:</strong> The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions.</li></ul><p>Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly.</p><p>Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season.</p><p>To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments.</p><h2>Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same</h2><p>The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. </p><p>The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income.</p><p>Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin—bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. </p><p>With that as a backdrop, let’s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. </p><h2>Strategies and Case Studies</h2><h2>Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy</h2><p>Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn’t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. </p><p>When accounting for transactions, it’s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. </p><p>The IRS allows for “specific identification” accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item—in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong><em> Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000.</em></p><ul><li><em>With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000).</em></li></ul><ul><li>With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000).</li></ul><ul><li>HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case.  </li></ul><p><em>These would be short-term capital gains, so let’s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. </em></p><p>It’s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly.</p><h2>Tax loss harvesting</h2><p>Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we’ll leave it here for future readers. </p><p>In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong><em> </em><em>Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved.</em></p><p>Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the <strong>tax loss carry forward</strong> technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains.</p><p>If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. </p><h2>Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket</h2><p>A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. </p><p>For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain’t so bad. Sign me up. I’ll even pay it twice. </p><p>And “taxable income” is calculated <strong>after</strong> the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single).</p><p><strong><em>Scenario: </em></strong><em>Let’s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their </em><strong><em>bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free)</em></strong><em>. And we’ll assume that they live in</em><em> one of the nine US states</em><em> that don’t have an income tax, so let’s call it 0% state tax as well.</em></p><p><strong>It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free—</strong>valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a <strong>strategic sell and immediate rebuy</strong> opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. </p><p>Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting.</p><p>Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). </p><p>The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting.</p><p>A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/102715/pros-and-cons-creating-backdoor-roth-ira.asp">Roth IRA conversions</a> or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/property-sale-installment-payment.asp">liquidating assets through installment sales</a>.</p><h2>Gifting</h2><p>We’ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people.</p><h3>Charity</h3><p>When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed.</p><p><em><strong>Scenario</strong>: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he’d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains.</em></p><p>You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. </p><p>“But I don’t want to have less bitcoin!”</p><p>If bitcoin holders are familiar with “spend and replace,” we can consider a similar strategy like “donate and replace.” You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes.</p><h3>Donor-advised funds</h3><p>For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a "charitable savings account": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time.</p><p>Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications.</p><h3>Friends and family</h3><p>Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. </p><p>Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you).</p><p><em><strong>Scenario:</strong> A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their “lifetime bucket.” Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. </em></p><h2>Roth accounts</h2><p>Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability.</p><p>If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings.</p><p>If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you.</p><p>With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort.</p><h2>A note on wash sales</h2><p>The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin.</p><p>Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended.</p><p>Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit.</p><p>It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency.</p><p><em>1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events.</em></p><p><em>2)</em> These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. </p><blockquote><p><br>CONTACT<br>Office: (208)-254-0142<br>408 South Eagle Rd.<br>Ste. 205<br>Eagle, ID 83616<br>hello@thesoundadvisory.com<br><br>Check the background of your financial professional on FINRA's <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/">BrokerCheck</a>.

<p>The story of "My Trust In You Is Broken" revolves around the Block Size Wars era in 2017, particularly BitPay's advocacy for SegWit2x, which would have increased Bitcoin's block size limit. Seeing this, Dorier was motivated to create BTCPay Server in defiance of this centralized control, empowering merchants to accept Bitcoin directly on their own, promoting decentralization and independence from intermediaries.</p><p>The documentary, spanning 42 minutes, sheds light on the importance of verifying transactions and the risks associated with trusting third parties blindly. It showcases BTCPay Server's journey from its inception in 2017, highlighting its evolution into a community-driven platform known for its privacy and autonomy features.</p><figure>

In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. </p><p>Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. </p><p>Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. </p><p>By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250—a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-btc-all-time-high-70k">briefly touched $70,000</a> recently. </p><p>With this kind of growth, it’s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to “HODL" until it reaches new price highs. </p><p>However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. </p><p>As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. </p><p>What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC?

                    <h2>Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending</h2><p>Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. </p><p>You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments—similar to how a bank operates. </p><p>Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent—thus becoming overcollateralized loans. </p><h2>How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan</h2><p>A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. </p><p>The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. </p><p>Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. </p><p>The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings.</p><h2>Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan</h2><p>Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: </p><h3>Risks associated with rehypothecation</h3><p>Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. </p><p>Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties.</p><p>With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral—or even 100 percent—is at risk. </p><p>Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. </p><p>Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on.</p><h3>Annual percentage rate (APR)</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp">annual percentage rate, also known as the APR</a>, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. </p><p>In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. </p><p>The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. </p><p>A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. </p><h3>LTV requirement</h3><p>The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates.</p><p>Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. </p><h3>Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV)</h3><p>The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. </p><h3>Tax implications</h3><p>Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. </p><p>The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. </p><p>Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. </p><p>Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best. </p><figure>

                    <h2>What are the benefits of Bitcoin loans?</h2><p>Bitcoin-backed loans offer several advantages, especially for long-term holders. The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. </p><figure>

                    <p>Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don’t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification.</p><p>Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. </p><h2>Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin</h2><p>Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. </p><p>Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. </p><p>Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. </p><p>As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Is it the JPEG People? Or is it the Laser-Eyed Maxis? Or is it both? </p><p>The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it’s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don’t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. </p><p>You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn’t have that, you likely didn’t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. </p><p>That dogma was necessary — without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn’t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. </p><p>Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. </p><figure>

                    <h2>Which Church Do You Go To?</h2><p>The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn’t die — it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn’t destroy it — they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. </p><p>The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther’s famous Theses. </p><p>What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. </p><p>This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. </p><p>That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. </p><p>They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. </p><p>Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. </p><h2>The Protestants’ Disgust With Indulgences</h2><p>So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let’s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences — the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, “As soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs”. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. </p><p>“Just follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.” Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they’re undeniable. </p><p>In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that “this one simple trick” is enough to guarantee an individual’s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can’t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. </p><p>It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It’s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. </p><p>Here’s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn’t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people — roughly the same size as the Catholic population — Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. </p><p>And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther’s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one’s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn’t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>Dissent Breeds Dissent</h2><p>Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn’t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it’s simply a matter of survival. </p><p>And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single “Protestant” dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. </p><p>We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as “against” the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as “doing what the Laser Eyes couldn’t” as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around “owning the Laser Eyes”. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. </p><p>That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? </p><p>The JPEG People claim they are here to “make Bitcoin fun again”, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to “own the Laser Eyes”. That doesn’t produce anything of value. That doesn’t actually inspire people with a vision. </p><p>Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own. </p><p>So what is the identity of the JPEG People without Laser Eyes to troll? Is there even one there when you take that away? </p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Inscription Issue”.

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the “liquidity crunch” issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. </p><p>Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it’s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. </p><p>As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator <em>has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state</em> they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. </p><p>So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they’ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network.</p><h2>The Liquidity Crunch</h2><p>The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator’s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. </p><p>For now let’s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they <em>should</em> have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. </p><p>It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they <em>have</em> processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. </p><p>This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users’ money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? </p><h2>The Options</h2><p>The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. </p><p>So now that we understand the problem let’s look at some potential solutions. </p><h3>Throttling</h3><p>You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. </p><p>The problem with this is you don’t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don’t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. </p><p>This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. </p><h3>Multiple Operators</h3><p>Both BitVM 1 and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field">BitVM 2</a> support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator’s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. </p><p>This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator.</p><p>It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren’t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. </p><h3>Multiple Linear Operators</h3><p>In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. </p><p>This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. </p><h3>The Backstop</h3><p>In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. </p><p>Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users’ funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist.</p><p>So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users’ funds and make them whole. I don’t think this is that bad. </p><p>Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. </p><p>That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. </p><p>I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users’ funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. </p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users’ funds, to losing operators’ funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. </p><p>It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I’ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. </p><p>As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjIyMzE0MTM2NTEyMDI5/bitvm2bridge.jpg"><media:title>bitvm2bridge</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The U.S. Needs To Lead in Bitcoin, Says Congressman Patrick McHenry]]></title><description><![CDATA[The United States Representative says that cash is king in illicit finance and that Bitcoin is a bastion of freedom.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-us-needs-to-lead-in-bitcoin-says-congressman-patrick-mchenry</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-us-needs-to-lead-in-bitcoin-says-congressman-patrick-mchenry</guid><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Patrick McHenry]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Us Congressman]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:27:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjE5MjgyNDI2NDcxODc3/screenshot-2024-04-09-at-102504am.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="https://www.btcpolicysummit.org/">Bitcoin Policy Summit</a> in Washington DC today, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) emphasized the importance of the United States taking a leadership role in Bitcoin and not lagging behind in during a fireside chat with Club for Growth President David McIntosh.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Congressman Patrick McHenry says the US needs to be a leader in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> 👏 <a href="https://t.co/jC20GaurXe">pic.twitter.com/jC20GaurXe</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1777703772694667444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"This is where the action is, this is a bastion of freedom," McHenry stated when asked why he was speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Summit this morning. "The way I view Bitcoin is — what Satoshi brought into this world has been unstoppable. Every regime that has tried to shut it down as failed, even the Chinese communist party that tried to shut down Bitcoin couldn't. And so it is an unstoppable piece of technology."</p><p>McHenry, known for his advocacy of financial innovation and technology, emphasized the need for his collogues in office to become educated on Bitcoin, acknowledging the challenges of regulating this technology with uninformed policy makers.</p><p>"The dumbest way to try to obscure your transactions are to do them in public," McHenry explained. "And the level of embarrassment when senators and members of the house ask questions about this on how to obscure these transactions. And when you have to explain to them that this is an open ledger that people can see the movement of value, and they don't understand that...Cash is still king in illicit finance."  </p><p>The congressman further highlighted how "it is a much easier conversation" to have with fellow politicians if they were to read the Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto before coming together to legislate. McHenry said that the lack of understanding of Bitcoin amongst policy makers has resulted in them going down rabbit holes of misinformation. And that causes them to speak in truths while legislating, based off of that information.</p><p>Overall, McHenry's message at the Bitcoin Policy Summit reflected a sense of urgency and opportunity, urging the United States to embrace its potential as a leader in the Bitcoin revolution and chart a course for a dynamic and innovative future in finance and technology.</p><p>"I'm trying to convince policy makers on the hill to embrace and for the United States to be leaders in, rather than fall behind. And I want to make sure you all hear that message clearly," Congressman McHenry said.</p><p>For more information about the annual Bitcoin Policy Summit, including the full agenda and list of speakers, visit BPI’s website <a href="https://www.btcpolicysummit.org/">here</a>.

One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. </p><p>While listening to a <a href="https://whatbitcoindid.libsyn.com/bitcoin-satoshis-vision-with-dhruv-bansal-wbd786">recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal</a> they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. </p><p>I really liked Dhruv’s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows:</p><h3>Version 1: The Commonly Held View</h3><p>The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you’d describe this is “6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.” </p><h3>Version 2: Dhruv’s View</h3><p>ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term “released” to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term “unlocked” for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv’s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv’s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. </p><h2>Why is Dhruv’s framing important? </h2><p>By framing mining as <em>buying</em> coins rather than <em>creating</em> coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? </p><p>If miners are <em>creating</em> bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an "inefficiency of scale" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! </p><p>Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *<em>purchasing</em>* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. </p><p>Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don’t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets</h2><p>Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. </p><p>Layer zero is what I’d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin <em>that already exist</em> to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn’t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. </p><p>Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a “two sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.” The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price <em>collectively</em> for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. </p><p>There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers “wins the auction” using Dhruv’s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES.</p><p>The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, “Each of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says ‘what were the most recent bids in time?’ and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.” </p><p>The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users <em>and</em> the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] </p><h2>What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero?</h2><p>What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says “it’s computations for bitcoin.” Layer 0 is a “market between two aggregates.” It’s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two “participants” in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. </p><p>Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation <em>and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work</em>.</p><p>The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? </p><p>Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think “how wasteful," think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv’s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. </p><p>There are some who believe that transaction costs won’t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. </p><p>The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. </p><p>In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. </p><p>Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. </p><p>For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future. </p><p>Special thanks to Dhruv Bansal for providing constructive input on this article. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia.

This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything?</p><p>If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I’m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. </p><p>To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. </p><p>It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. </p><h2>Verifying Things Yourself</h2><p>When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network’s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network</p><p>Most people likely don’t care about other people’s bitcoin payments, if you aren’t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. </p><p>Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. </p><p>When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. </p><h2>The Supply Cap</h2><p>The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not <em>the</em>, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. </p><p>All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. </p><p>Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. </p><h2>Keeping Your Bitcoin Private</h2><p>Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. </p><p>When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else’s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. </p><p>If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. </p><p>Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. </p><h2>Why This is All Important</h2><p>While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits.</p><p>Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don’t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. </p><p>Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. </p><p>Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else’s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. </p><p>Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network. Once you have your keys safely secured, it is absolutely important that you take this next step. </p><p>Here are some wallets and tools to help you in that process:</p><p><a href="https://bitcoincore.org/">Bitcoin Core</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/gain-full-sovereignty-run-your-own-bitcoin-node-with-ledger-satstack">Ledger Satstack</a></p><p><a href="https://fullynoded.app/">Fully Noded</a></p><p><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a></p><p><a href="https://specter.solutions/desktop/index.html">Specter Wallet</a></p><p><a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a></p><p><a href="https://runcitadel.space/">Citadel</a></p><p><a href="https://ronindojo.io/">Ronin Dojo</a></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTk0ODk4ODIzMzkwMjgy/ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTk0ODk4ODIzMzkwMjgy/ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Despite Criticism, Lightning Network Continues Seeing Major Rollouts ]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a “dead end” as capacity drops.

                    <p>Bitcoin’s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. </p><p>The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin’s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it’s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador’s government <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/27/bitcoins-lightning-network-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/">uses</a> Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. </p><p>Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-doesnt-work">multiple</a> defenses of Lightning’s long-term <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/lightning-is-doomed">viability</a> as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a “silver bullet” to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-lightning-network-major-challanges">grew</a> to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users’ money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. </p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/02/are-bitcoin-developers-losing-faith-in-lightning/">question</a> if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly <a href="https://protos.com/critics-claim-buggy-bitcoin-lightning-network-is-slowly-dying/">quit</a> the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes <a href="https://twitter.com/truthcoin/status/1719388665107947959">both</a> the protocol’s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, “everyone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people” to Lightning, a “microscopic” amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, “almost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it” amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning’s future prospects has <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281529/lightning-networks-us-dollar-capacity-surges-to-all-time-high-as-bitcoin-capacity-falters">emerged</a>, as the network’s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/lisa-neigut-reinventing-lightning-to-reinvent-bitcoin/">optimism</a> and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-receives-1-5m-funding-to-expand-bitcoin-lightning-network-in-southeast-asia">secured</a> $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes.</p><p>This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/largest-us-crypto-exchange-coinbase-to-integrate-the-bitcoin-lightning-network">finalized</a> a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange’s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark’s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. </p><p>The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to “inscribe” unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-nintendo-64-emulator">inscribe</a> discontinued video games. </p><figure>

                    <p>This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bug-fix-expected-to-halt-btc-ordinals-and-brc-20-tokens-says-bitcoin-dev/">claimed</a> that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a “vulnerability” in Bitcoin, one that is being “exploited... to spam the blockchain." The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/bitcoin-fees-spike-during-ordinals">linked</a> to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to “fix” this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals’ continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance <a href="https://decrypt.co/224788/binance-nft-marketplace-axes-bitcoin-ordinals">quoted</a> their “ongoing efforts to streamline product offerings” as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. </p><p>The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning’s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin’s usability, while Ordinals’ critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin’s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it’s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. </p><p>And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr’s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/09/bitcoin-developers-proposal-to-stop-spam-nfts-gets-shut-down/">rejected</a> by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/franklin-templeton-ordinals-renaissance-bitcoin-nft-innovation">endorsed</a> Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a “renaissance” in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin’s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain’s flexibility and superiority over its competitors. Praise like this from such an important source could truly be groundbreaking.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=author-post-insert&utm_source=bmpro"></a></p><p>Events like this serve, more than anything, to prove once again that Bitcoin’s spirit is not merely posed to disrupt established industries and build a more rational order on the wreckage. Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin’s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It’s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it’s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTg1NDQ2NjMxMzI0/default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTg1NDQ2NjMxMzI0/default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1.jpg"><media:title>default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTMzMzcwMTUyODYw/a706054e-ae71-459b-8f39-dca89b41f8da_1600x1089.jpg"><media:title>a706054e-ae71-459b-8f39-dca89b41f8da_1600x1089</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/lightning-network-capacity/">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTUxODkyMTk5MzI0/f06af934-7229-4fc7-84ce-94b35939f7e0_4000x2637.jpg"><media:title>f06af934-7229-4fc7-84ce-94b35939f7e0_4000x2637</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Download the full 20-page research report prepared by <a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester">Tuur Demeester</a> (Founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamantResearch">Adamant Research</a>) for <a href="https://twitter.com/unchainedcom">Unchained</a>.]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China's Largest Funds Apply for Spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong]]></title><description><![CDATA[Major Chinese asset managers like Harvest Fund and Southern Fund are leveraging Hong Kong subsidiaries to apply for Bitcoin ETFs.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 11:02:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTgyODkzMTc2NzQ5NjMwODgz/img_5987.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of China's biggest asset managers are using Hong Kong subsidiaries to enter the Bitcoin ETF market, according to recent reports.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇨🇳 $284 billion China Southern Fund has reportedly applied to launch spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF via Hong Kong.<br><br>You can&#39;t stop an idea whose time has come 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/rnHOuRoY7V">pic.twitter.com/rnHOuRoY7V</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1777270610139238847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

The halving (also known as the “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-halvening">Halvening</a>”) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the “block subsidy”) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin’s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. .</p><h2>WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING?</h2><p>The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period — or epoch — will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. </p><h3>TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE</h3><ol><li>Determine the block interval: While it’s true that Bitcoin’s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments.</li><li>Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you’re running one.</li><li>Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin’s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height.</li><li>Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving.</li><li>Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected.</li></ol><p>Current block height: can be found <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc">here</a>.</p><p>Block time: can be found <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y">here</a>. </p><p>Current date: xx/xx/xxxx</p><p>Blocks per epoch: 210,000</p><p>Next halving block height: 210,000 <em>times</em> next halving number</p><p>Calculation: </p><p>(((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining</p><p>Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it’s important to keep running the calculation.</p><h2>HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS</h2><figure>

These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events.</p><ul><li>After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162.</li><li>After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800.</li><li>After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000.</li></ul><p><em>Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years.</em></p><figure>

                    <h3>Challenges for Miners</h3><p>Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network’s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin’s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. </p><h2>FAQs:</h2><p><strong>Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? </strong></p><p>Bitcoin’s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin’s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it’s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling.</p><p><strong>Is Bitcoin halving bullish?</strong></p><p>The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it’s wise to remember that bitcoin’s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. </p><p><strong>How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak?</strong></p><p>A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. </p><p><strong>Should you buy bitcoin before the halving?</strong></p><p>Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it’s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTc5OTk5NTk0Mzk2/when-bitcoin-halving-16x9.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTc5OTk5NTk0Mzk2/when-bitcoin-halving-16x9.png"><media:title>when-bitcoin-halving-16x9</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTczODI1NzA5OTgw/unnamed-1.png"><media:title>unnamed-1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTMxNTU4MjU2MzIxNjEw/unnamed.png"><media:title>unnamed</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[National Emergency: Executive Order 6102 and the Heist of the Century]]></title><description><![CDATA[A comprehensive history of the events leading up to the historic Executive Order 6102 under FDR that led to widespread gold confiscation in the United States. ]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-</guid><category><![CDATA[April 5th]]></category><category><![CDATA[Executive Order 6102]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[6102]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Julian Fahrer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI3MzQ0MzU2NTMzNjQx/default_the_6102_gold_confiscation_0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Ninety-one years ago today, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history.</p><p>Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead.</p><p>On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.<sup>1</sup></p><p>EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. </p><p>As such, it’s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners’ interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it’s <em>the</em> quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it’s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody.</p><p>Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn’t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. </p><p>Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there’s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don’t pay your taxes.</p><p>For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again.</p><p>However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on <em>why</em> FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR’s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that “without his New Deal, we would all have been lost.”<sup>2</sup></p><p>On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and “accustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.”<sup>3</sup></p><p>All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is <em>how</em> FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. </p><p>This is because, despite the fact that FDR’s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America’s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), “rule by personal decree”<sup>4</sup>, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher.</p><p>This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans’ rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. </p><p>If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. </p><h2>The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency</h2><p><em>“Now, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes” </em></p><p><em>- Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses</em></p><p>I’m not sure anyone’s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole <em>not been Machiavellian enough</em>, but in this case the historical record is clear. </p><p>Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), ‘disregarding the laws for good objects’ has been practically a job requirement of the oval office.</p><p>Carl Schmitt said that “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit ‘extra-constitutional’ exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt’s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice.</p><p>In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp.</p><p>The phrase is “national emergency”. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you’re an American adult, it’s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the ‘anti-terrorism’ provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19.</p><p>In fact, it’s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the ‘national emergency’ has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 <em>National Emergencies Act</em>. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.<sup>5</sup></p><figure>

Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist…”</p><figure>

                    <p>But still, the story goes deeper. It’s not <em>just</em> enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn’t the case in 1933.</p><p>So what was FDR’s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold?</p><p>The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first.</p><h2>The Beginning: Principled Piracy</h2><p>In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia.</p><p>About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the <em>Rapid,</em> to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the<em> Jefferson</em>, who claimed the ship’s goods as a prize.</p><p>Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the <em>Jefferson</em>. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. </p><p>The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was “trading with the enemy”, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.<sup>6</sup></p><p>Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. </p><p>“But”, (I hear you interject), “By what definition could an ‘American with gold’ be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn’t even a war in 1933!” Fantastic points, and you’re right to make them. </p><p>To preface the answer, let’s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major ‘philosophies’ that you might subscribe to. </p><p>Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn’t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these ‘philosophies’ help judges decide the ‘right’ way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that’s another story).</p><p>If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the ‘meaning’ of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A ‘Living Constitution’ approach: where you basically say, ‘to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today’.</p><p>The third approach is more or less how the law around ‘national emergencies’ has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate ‘natural selection’ evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast.</p><p>So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. </p><p>Now let’s fill in the gaps and show how that happened.</p><h2>1917: National Emergencies Go Up</h2><p>There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five.</p><p>One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the <em>Espionage Act, </em>was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today.</p><p>This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under.</p><p>1917 was also the first time the phrase “national emergency” passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America’s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.<sup>7</sup> Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin’ violation. </p><p>This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. </p><p>Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since <em>The Rapid</em>, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle.</p><p>The solution was the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em>, which brought the principle of <em>The Rapid</em> into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to “define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.”<sup>8</sup> In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.<sup>9</sup></p><p>Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, “perhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.”<sup>10</sup> This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives.</p><p>For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.<sup>11</sup></p><figure>

                    <p>This was all authorized by the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em>. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story.</p><p>That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in “foreign exchange”, or by any foreign country.<sup>12</sup></p><p>You might sense now that we’re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness.</p><p>But we’re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President’s power in 1917 was still limited to “during the time of war.”<sup>13</sup></p><p>It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it.</p><h2>Great Depression: FDR’s Opportunity</h2><p>That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis.</p><p>Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank’s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would “no longer take responsibility” for the bank’s “deficient reserves”.<sup>14</sup></p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a ‘gold standard’ was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.<sup>15</sup></p><p>The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government’s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. </p><p>Meanwhile, “all of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.”<sup>16</sup></p><p>FDR’s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. </p><p>He called out the “unscrupulous money changers”, and the “falsity of material wealth”, and demanded that “there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.”<sup>17</sup></p><p>Now, if you’ve been paying attention, you shouldn’t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a “broad Executive power to <em>wage a war against the emergency</em>, as great as the power that would be given to me if <em>we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe</em>.”<sup>18</sup></p><p>It was all downhill from there.</p><p>Two days after FDR’s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a ‘Bank Holiday’ from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the “hoarding”.<sup>19</sup></p><p>Stopping the run wasn’t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting “the names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.”<sup>20</sup></p><p>On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate “any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.”<sup>21</sup></p><p>Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em> restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR’s inaugural address, the <em>Emergency Banking Act</em> (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality.</p><p>Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce “during time of war”, or crucially, “during <em>any other period of national emergency declared by the President</em>.”</p><p>FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. </p><p>By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: “HOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty”<sup>22</sup></p><p>This brings us to the end of the story. From <em>The Rapid</em>, to the <em>Trading with the Enemy Act</em>, to the <em>Emergency Banking Act</em>, to Executive Order 6102. </p><p>The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. </p><p>This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn’t.</p><h2>Conclusion: Could It Happen Again?</h2><p>Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin?</p><p>Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes.</p><figure>

                    <p>The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn’t control; Government wasn’t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff.</p><p>The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024.</p><p>This isn’t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either.</p><p>The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. </p><p>Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. </p><p>History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. </p><p>What does the next national emergency look like? </p><p>A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities<sup>23</sup> trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? </p><p>We don’t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate.</p><p>In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>’s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff.</p><p>Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a <em>chance</em> at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation.</p><p>So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>And see you in hell, FDR.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p><sup>1 </sup>Executive Order 6102, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102</a></p><p><sup>2 </sup>Shlaes, Amity, <em>The Forgotten Man</em>, Introduction</p><p><sup>3 </sup>Shlaes, Amity, <em>The Forgotten Man</em>, Introduction</p><p><sup>4 </sup>Mencius Moldbug, March 19 2010, <em>The true election: a practical option for political change, <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2010/03/true-election-practical-option-for-real/">https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2010/03/true-election-practical-option-for-real/</a></em></p><p><sup>5 </sup>List of national emergencies in the United States, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States</a></p><p><sup>6 </sup>The Rapid, 12 U.S. 155 (1814), <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/12/155/">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/12/155/</a></p><p><sup>7 </sup>Proclamation 1354, <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-1354-emergency-water-transportation-the-united-states">https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-1354-emergency-water-transportation-the-united-states</a></p><p><sup>8 </sup>Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917</a></p><p><sup>9 </sup>The Secret Life of Statutes: A Century of the Trading with the Enemy Act, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-american-history/article/secret-life-of-statutes-a-century-of-the-trading-with-the-enemy-act/77DD7CF528D3190CFC8CF8FF6DDAACB0#fn68">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-american-history/article/secret-life-of-statutes-a-century-of-the-trading-with-the-enemy-act/77DD7CF528D3190CFC8CF8FF6DDAACB0#fn68</a></p><p><sup>10 </sup>Congressional Record — House, July 9 1917, 4842, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1917/07/09/house-section">https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1917/07/09/house-section</a></p><p><sup>11 </sup>The U.S. Confiscated Half a Billion Dollars in Private Property During WWI, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/</a></p><p><sup>12 </sup>Trading with the Enemy Act 1917, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf</a></p><p><sup>13 </sup>Trading with the Enemy Act 1917, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/pdf/USCODE-2011-title50-app-tradingwi.pdf</a></p><p><sup>14 </sup>Bank Holiday of 1933, <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bank-holiday-of-1933">https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bank-holiday-of-1933</a></p><p><sup>15 </sup>‘Roosevelt's Gold Program’, <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts-gold-program">https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts-gold-program</a></p><p><sup>16 </sup>FDR’s Second Fireside Chat, <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/may-7-1933-fireside-chat-2-progress-during-first-two-months">https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/may-7-1933-fireside-chat-2-progress-during-first-two-months</a></p><p><sup>17 </sup>First Inaugural Address of Franklin D.

Advances in agriculture meant that people and their property were often geographically stationary, making them sitting ducks for “specialists in violence”, the predecessors to modern governments, who back then, were both the plunderers and protectors against plunder. The stirrup, contoured saddle, spur, and curb bit had a combined similar disrupting effect, shifting power away from heavy cavalry to a single armed knight. The Gunpowder Revolution disrupted the feudal order of the day, reinforced in those days by the Catholic Church. Rees-Mogg and Davidson write, “the Church tended to make religious virtues of its own economic interests, while militating against the development of manufacturing and independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal system.” The printing press disrupted the Church <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-future-will-be-flatter-than-ever/">even further</a>: causing it to lose its monopoly on biblical narrative. The result was a major loss in its influence and power, which gave way to the modern nation state. </p><p>Rees-Mogg and Davidson argue that the microprocessor would inevitably disrupt the nation state in the same way that the printing press disrupted Christendom a few hundred years ago. The internet itself (a globally-interconnected community) and public key cryptography (which protects both communications and property of Bitcoin) are made possible by microprocessors. </p><h2>The present and future</h2><p>One major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the currency front. Since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception, we have been able to transact permissionlessly, borderlessly, and (often) anonymously. Nation states have long been jealous of any challenge to their monopoly on money, and they will spend vast sums of money to ensure that there are no serious monetary rivals. Bitcoin serves as an alternative to that trap, which is why it is under attack by the likes of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/us-senator-elizabeth-warren-introduces-bill-to-crack-down-on-bitcoin-and-crypto">politicians</a> and the <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-inc-statement-the-new-york-times-politically-driven-attack-on-bitcoin-mining-is-full-of-distortions-outright-falsehoods/">crumbling legacy media</a>. </p><p>But to transact on Bitcoin, you need miners. No doubt, regulators in the United States and Europe observed as China outlawed Bitcoin mining in 2021, which only resulted in the majority of the hashing power <a href="https://archive.is/cOE3a">moving</a> from that country to the United States. So while they would probably wish to ban it in the United States and Europe outright, they know that they would only lose both regulatory control and tax revenue from Bitcoin miners by doing so. Thus, for now, not even Elizabeth Warren – the most Bitcoin-hostile legislator in Washington – proposes to outright ban Bitcoin. Instead, she <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-expands-coalition-of-banking-committee-support-for-bill-cracking-down-on-cryptos-use-in-money-laundering-drug-trafficking-sanctions-evasion">proposes</a> to expand know-your-customer (KYC) rules to essentially all parties within the Bitcoin ecosystem as well as discourage self-custody and privacy-enhancing technologies. </p><p>Bitcoin does have an important weak point of centralization (for now): the hardware. The University of Cambridge produces industry reports on Bitcoin mining and <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/">communicates</a> that, hardware-wise, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin miners report to use an “ASIC” chip for mining Bitcoin’s SHA-256 hashing algorithm produced by Singapore-based company <a href="https://www.bitmain.com/about">Bitmain</a>, with competitors MicroBT and Canaan trailing behind. Regardless of where Bitmain produces its ASIC chips, the ideal scenario for Bitcoin’s decentralization would be that production of ASIC miners (and the mining itself for that matter) would be dispersed around the world so that no specific region could have a definitive advantage, taking the majority control of the hashing power. A reasonable compromise would be one in which ASIC miners were produced, at scale and in high quality, by at least more manufacturers than there are now, especially across countries that are not politically aligned with one another so that collusion between them would be increasingly unlikely. </p><p>A second major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) front. I once attended a conference in which Peter Thiel participated as a speaker. He said something very close to the following (quoted from my memory): “Bitcoin is a technology that, on net, favors the individual. AI is a technology that, on net, favors the state.” It is the latter technology and its favoring the state that emphasizes the importance of getting it into the hands of as many participants as possible if we are to build a truly decentralized world.</p><p>One risk to AI’s decentralization is one that Bitcoin has in common: a potential future scenario in which hardware is monitored and must be registered by law. In the case of Bitcoin, that would mean miners must register their ASIC chips. In the case of AI, it could mean that even you or I would need to register graphics processing units (GPUs) above a certain capacity (or, in the case of software, that matrices must be registered). Guillaume Verdon, the name behind the now doxed alias @BasedBeffJesos, <a href="https://youtu.be/8fEEbKJoNbU?si=2cgU1RfLMMw2l9-z&t=7812">highlighted</a> this risk in a podcast with Lex Fridman, arguing that this could “[stop] the open source ecosystem from thriving… by executive order, claiming that open source LLMs are dual-use technologies and should be government-controlled.”</p><p>Although executive orders could not kill Bitcoin (but could discourage some people from using it), similar reporting requirements for miners would likely, to some degree, impact Bitcoin’s open source ecosystem.</p><p>A third major battleground worth highlighting is 3D printers, assemblers, and other tools in the “maker” arsenal. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">“maker” movement</a> hints at a future solution to the problem of centralization tendencies for Bitcoin and AI. </p><p>Imagine a world with 3D printers and accompanying tools in most people’s homes. If you could print your own high-quality ASIC Bitcoin miners and GPUs for running large language models (LLMs), decentralization is light-years ahead. </p><p>We can ignore for a moment the futuristic scenario in which 3D printers and other “maker” tools are used to produce hardware for Bitcoin and AI applications. Even at present, at least one government is looking at the 3D printer with the same skeptical eye that the Catholic Church had for the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries. New York State’s <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/A8132">Assembly Bill A8132</a>, if passed into law, would require criminal background checks, with fingerprints sent to the FBI, in order to purchase 3D printers “capable of creating firearms.” It is reasonable to expect that various governments, fearing loss of their own centralized power, will continue to push registration and “KYC” requirements to maintain control of real-space tools that facilitate decentralization in cyberspace. </p><p>Note: The Soviet Union had similar controls on seemingly harmless products such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sW6poA4OPA&t=170s">books, photocopiers, fax machines</a> – all of which facilitated the spread of information, and thus, threatened the regime. There were similar efforts to control the sale of fabric that could be used to build hot air balloons in East Germany, to stop people from escaping to West Germany. (See the 1982 American film <em>Night Crossing</em> and the 2018 German film <em>Balloon</em> that both document a real escape). </p><p>Localized manufacturing, whether at home or in a so-called community fabrication laboratory or “fab lab”, is likely to come under increased hostility by various governments as 3D printers and other “maker” tools are able to produce even more sophisticated electronics. But, for now at least, fab labs are growing exponentially in number, with <a href="https://fablabs.io/labs">well over 2,000</a> of them spread around the world so far, and even receive various levels of support by governments. These fab labs, by the way, don’t account for the many more personalized labs in people’s homes. </p><p>Neil Gershenfeld at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms tries to understand what the world looks like when almost anybody can make almost anything and when machines can make other machines, even machines more sophisticated than themselves, and often with locally-sourced materials. </p><p>Gershenfeld argues in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDjOS0VHEr4">podcast appearance</a> that localized manufacturing doesn’t scale and that production is generally for personal use, not commercial sale. But when many thousands of people around the world learn how to locally produce their own 3D-printed and home-assembled Bitcoin miner and then combine their individual hashing power with others in a mining pool and coordinate with one another over the Tor network… then the world starts to look much more decentralized. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin, AI, and 3D printers share a common theme of decentralization and disruptive potential for the nation state. As both Bitcoin’s ASIC mining chips and GPUs used to run LLMs exist in real-space where nation states are most dominant, governments may become increasingly hostile towards such hardware: requiring criminal background checks, KYC, etc. Interestingly, 3D printers, assemblers, and other “maker” tools could be used now or in the future for localized manufacturing (whether at home or in so-called “fab labs”), enabling a much more decentralized world. </p><p>Meanwhile, on the policy front, criminal background checks and registration requirements for 3D printers and other “maker” tools such as those proposed in New York’s Assembly Bill A8132 deserve a skeptical eye and strong political pushback.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Emile Phaneuf.

It is a brazen attempt to assert foreign influence across Latin America and threatens to reshape the very fabric of the region and the day to day lives of its people. At its core is a serpentine set of contractual obligations, held at the municipal level, cast throughout Central and South America, upheld by an intelligence-linked satellite company, and controlled by a private se­ctor consortium of green-washed financiers aiming to turn the region’s forests into equity and carbon credits. At the same time, it obliges local governments to spend “conservation” funds on projects that further financialize nature and aid the construction of an inter-continental “smart” grid. One of its key ambitions appears to be further entrenching the debt load of the region through the multi-lateral development banks and the dollarization of the continent from the subnational level up through carbon markets upheld by a digital ledger. What seems like a technological marvel aimed at progress and connectivity harbors a darker agenda — one that intertwines planetary surveillance, financial predation, geopolitical maneuvering, and the domination of a resource-rich continent buried in debt.</p><p>This grand design, known by the acronym GREEN+ and conceived by stalwarts of the digital dollar and debt schemes of the private sector, has quietly taken root through a web of political entanglements at the local level. Even a key figure in the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal plays a role. Astonishingly, every capital city of Latin America has eagerly signed on, apparently unaware of the strings attached to these seemingly benign partnerships, while a majority of municipalities in the region have also made commitments with these same groups that will push them to join GREEN+, potentially in a matter of weeks. The (hopefully) well-meaning regional governments have unwittingly paved the way for a sweeping surveillance apparatus tied to American intelligence that threatens to erode privacy and civil liberties under the guise of progress and combating the climate crisis.</p><p>Upon further observation, GREEN+'s connections reveal a disturbing narrative of financial interests melding with geopolitical ambitions. The backers of the satellite company share ties with former members of the highest offices of US financial policy and regulation alongside the key architects and profiteers of private capital creation, aiming to consolidate control over monetary flows in Latin America within the redistribution of distressed government debt from the public to the private sector. As this two-part series will show, this concerted effort is not merely about surveillance – it's a calculated move towards further dollarization, tightening the grip of corporate and technological monopolies over the economic landscape of the Americas.  </p><p>The scheme's proponents also speak of how it will significantly advance the "economic" and "regional" integration of the Americas, invoking visions of unity while obscuring the true nature of their agenda for economic domination and stronger regional governance. Their model, eerily reminiscent of the EU's transition from a free trade union to a bureaucratic behemoth yoked to the US through the Eurodollar, sets the stage for unelected entities to enforce policies through programmable money, enabled by smart contracts on blockchains and designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. What materializes before us is not just a technological evolution but a quiet banker coup — one that lays the groundwork for land grabs and invasive surveillance under the guise of progress and conservation. It's a narrative that echoes throughout history, where intelligence-linked figures and predatory financial interests converge to prey upon the Global South, leaving a trail of economic exploitation and geopolitical manipulation in their wake. What masquerades as progress for individuals and the environment at large may very well be the harbinger of a new era of subjugation and control.  </p><figure>

Most of the GREEN+ agreements with “subnational” governments have remained focused on Latin America. <a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">Per the program</a>, the subnational agreements have established the “rules and requirements to enable accounting and crediting with GREEN+ policies and measures and/or nested projects, implemented as GHG mitigation activities,” with GREEN+ being described as “the planet's new subnational government advisory mechanism.”</p><p>Key to the program are the services provided by GREEN+ founding member <a href="https://satellogic.com/company/partners/">Satellogic</a>, an Argentina-founded company <a href="https://satellogic.com/news/press-releases/satellogic-announces-strategic-partnership-with-palantir-technologies/">closely aligned with</a> Peter Thiel’s Palantir and <a href="https://satellogic.com/news/press-releases/satellogic-announces-multiple-launch-agreement-with-spacex-for-its-next-68-sub-meter-resolution-earth-observation-satellites/">Elon Musk’s SpaceX</a> that specializes in sub-meter resolution satellite surveillance.

The press release also states that the GREEN+ alliance with Satellogic will “advance the future measurement of energy emissions in the most populated areas of the planet,” i.e. the surveillance of carbon emissions from space. Satellogic launched some GREEN+-affiliated satellites in 2022 as part of its pilot and is due to launch the remainder this April during Miami Climate Week.

                    <p>Though framed as a way to develop economic incentives to mitigate climate change, the program is based on California’s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-22/what-has-california-cap-and-trade-accomplished">controversial</a> and <a href="https://time.com/6264772/study-most-carbon-credits-are-bogus/">grift-prone</a> cap and trade program and has been created (and is being implemented by) individuals and companies that are seeking to covertly dollarize Latin America and/or have deep ties to US intelligence. Its ultimate ambitions go far beyond carbon markets and seek to use satellite surveillance to enforce carbon emission levels in both urban and rural areas. It also seeks to impose a new financial system centered around energy, commodity, and natural resource “credits” that are underpinned by extensive and invasive surveillance, underscored by the motto: “<a href="https://issuu.com/satelliteevolution/docs/satelliteevolutionglobal-february2023-download/s/19101555">Earth observation is preservation</a>.”</p><p>The alliance that created GREEN+ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220427141745/https://www.cercarbono.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GREEN-Jurisdictional-Programme-Description.pdf">includes</a> the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network (GFN), Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Catalytic Finance Foundation (CFF, formerly R20) and The Energy Coalition (TEC); the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas; the global insurance giant Lockton; the satellite company Satellogic; the “green” blockchain company EcoRegistry; the dominant carbon credit certifier in Latin America, Cercarbono; and Rootstock (RSK), the bitcoin side-chain protocol responsible for “smart BTC.” Several members of the alliance, though how many is unclear, <a href="https://guatediario.com/2022/01/24/global-carbon-parks-firma-contrato-de-u200mm-para-comercializar-creditos-de-carbono-vinculados-a-la-descarbonizacion/">now </a><a href="https://guatediario.com/2022/01/24/global-carbon-parks-firma-contrato-de-u200mm-para-comercializar-creditos-de-carbono-vinculados-a-la-descarbonizacion/">operate as part of a consortium</a> linked to a company called Global Carbon Parks, which is discussed in greater detail later in this article and now manages <a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">major aspects of GREEN+</a>. The NGOs (i.e. CC35, GFN, CFF and TEC) involved in founding GREEN+ are those who actually govern the GREEN+ program from California. </p><p>As previously mentioned, the program takes carbon in “effectively conserved protected areas of a sub-national jurisdiction”, i.e. a city, county, province, or state/region, and converts them into carbon credits. <a href="https://nomadsembassy.com/fbi-background-check-from-abroad/">Per the program</a>, “these credits are traded on the [carbon] offset market, and income is deposited in a trust fund” that is controlled by GREEN+ and is known as the GREEN+ Trust. That trust is <a href="https://nomadsembassy.com/fbi-background-check-from-abroad/">run by</a> unspecified individuals who work for Lockton, Isolas and Rootstock. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/satellogic-announces-exclusive-agreement-with-green-jurisdictional-programme-to">Alejandro Guerrero</a>, head of Lockton’s Argentina & Uruguay branch, is the only publicly acknowledged member of the trust. </p><p><a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">Another website</a> tied to the GREEN+ initiative describes the initial process as follows: </p><ol><li>Public and private agreements between [a subnational] government and custodians are signed with zero upfront cost.</li><li>Custodians trade the carbon units that are produced by the subnational governments (the public sector) signing contracts with the private sector in voluntary carbon markets.</li><li>Those contracts signed by the subnational governments become smart contracts and carbon credits are then tokenized for traceability.</li><li>The GREEN+ Trust holds government funds in escrow.</li></ol><p>Subsequently, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220427141745/https://www.cercarbono.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GREEN-Jurisdictional-Programme-Description.pdf">a</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220427141745/https://www.cercarbono.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GREEN-Jurisdictional-Programme-Description.pdf"> partial release</a> of trust funds is made periodically during the crediting period of the jurisdictional initiative.” From this “partial release,” “a percentage operational fee” is deducted (the percentage is undisclosed in the program’s documents) and paid to the GREEN+ program while a separate (and also undisclosed) fee is also deducted “for the operation of the GREEN+ Trust.” Disbursements of what remains are made annually over a ten year period and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220427141745/https://www.cercarbono.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GREEN-Jurisdictional-Programme-Description.pdf">per graphs</a> produced by GREEN+, those payments remain the same, fixed value even if the value of the carbon credits of the protected areas grows. </p><figure>

                    <p>Between 40% and 60% of the funds actually received by subnational governments <a href="https://nomadsembassy.com/fbi-background-check-from-abroad/">can be used</a> to “design and execute projects” aimed at conservation, while the rest “is allocated for new jurisdictional decarbonisation initiatives” that can produce additional or “consequential” carbon credits. These “consequential” credits are then “offered as a preferred option to the investors who initially purchased the conservation credits at a 50% discounted price calculated at the current market price.” However, later in the <a href="https://nomadsembassy.com/fbi-background-check-from-abroad/">same document</a>, the program says that “the amount required for the initial implementation” of conservation projects “may not exceed 20% of the funds allocated [from the GREEN+ Trust] to the jurisdictional initiative.” Clearly, the amount of funds actually being generated for conservation-related projects is minimal and, even in the best case scenario, is less than half of the capital generated by the carbon credits themselves. However, as we shall see, these “conservation” projects must be done in conjunction with approved partners of Global Carbon Parks, which – like the organization itself – are tied to predatory financial interests and oligarchs with questionable motives.</p><p>Of the funds that governments actually receive as part of GREEN+, half are officially meant to go toward conservation-related projects while the other half are meant to go toward decarbonization-related projects. However, on <a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">the Global Carbon Parks-</a><a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">GREEN+ website</a>, it notes that the decarbonization projects must be conducted alongside Community Electricity, which forms part of Global Carbon Parks and is closely connected to the GREEN+ alliance member The Energy Coalition (TEC). As will be discussed later, TEC and Community Electricity are together attempting to build an inter-continental “smart” grid in the Americas and are also involved in efforts to develop “smart” cities and suburbs. </p><p>As for GREEN+’s conservation projects, the website states that “50% of the resources received by the capital [city as part of GREEN+] must be used for social and environmental impact in protected urban areas with partners such as Cities4Forests.” Cities4Forests was founded by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a World Economic Forum affiliate and <a href="https://www.wri.org/about/history">contractor</a> to <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2014/4/4/is_usaid_the_new_cia_agency">suspected CIA front</a> USAID that is focused on resource “sustainability.” WRI is <a href="https://www.wri.org/annual-report/2022-23/donors">funded by</a> the US and several European governments, billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg as well as Google, Meta/Facebook, the Soros family’s Open Societies Foundations, the UN, Walmart, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, among others. WRI’s Cities4Forests shares many of <a href="https://cities4forests.com/about/founders-funders-partners/">the same</a><a href="https://cities4forests.com/about/founders-funders-partners/"> funding </a><a href="https://cities4forests.com/about/founders-funders-partners/">sources</a>, such as the governments of the UK, Germany, Denmark and the US as well as the World Bank and the Caterpillar Foundation. Other funders include the Wall Street giant Citi Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Notably, the Rockefeller Foundation and the IDB recently <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/10/investigative-reports/wall-streets-takeover-of-nature-advances-with-launch-of-new-asset-class/">teamed up</a> to create the Intrinsic Exchange Group, which has spearheaded the financialization of nature via the creation of Natural Asset Corporations (NACs). As<em> Unlimited Hangout </em><a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/10/investigative-reports/wall-streets-takeover-of-nature-advances-with-launch-of-new-asset-class/">previously reported</a>, NACs create corporations that take control of natural assets that were previously part of the “commons," such as forests, rivers and lakes, and then sell shares of those assets to Wall Street asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and other financial institutions in order to generate profit under the guise of “conserving” the asset they target. </p><figure>

                    <p>Unsurprisingly, most of Cities4Forests’ projects, such as those that would be built with GREEN+ funds, are similar to NACs in that they focus on using natural assets and “natural capital” to produce new financial and insurance products. Examples of Cities4Forests “conservation” projects include the development of a <a href="https://cities4forests.com/project/forest-resilience-bond/">Forest Resilience Bond</a> and <a href="https://www.nbs4india.org/partners/">the India Forum for Nature-based Solutions</a>. One of the India-based forum’s “core partners” is the Nature Conservancy, which has been run by Wall Street bankers for years and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tokenized-inc-blackrocks-plan-to-own-the-fractionalized-world-">has pioneered</a> the modern iteration of the controversial “debt for conservation” swap among other “nature-based solutions.” The funders of Cities4Forest and its creator the WRI are also deeply affiliated with groups like <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/11/investigative-reports/un-backed-banker-alliance-announces-green-plan-to-transform-the-global-financial-system/">the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero</a> (GFANZ) and UN-backed climate finance initiatives that <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/09/investigative-reports/sustainable-debt-slavery/">openly </a><a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/09/investigative-reports/sustainable-debt-slavery/">seek</a> to use debt imperialism to herd the global economy, with a focus on emerging markets, into <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/11/investigative-reports/un-backed-banker-alliance-announces-green-plan-to-transform-the-global-financial-system/">a new system of global financial governance</a>.</p><p>Thus, the “conservation” and “decarbonization” efforts that subnational governments must enact as part of their contractual agreements with GREEN+ will go towards projects tied to either the smart grid/smart city developer Community Electricity or a “conservation” organization backed by Western oligarchs, multi-national corporations and banks that seeks to financialize and monetize nature under the guise of conserving it.</p><h2>CC35 and the Subnational Pivot</h2><p>CC35, or Ciudades Capitales de las Americas frente al Cambio Climático (American Capital Cities Facing Climate Change), is the most visible organization behind the GREEN+ program and one of the members of its governance committee. CC35’s goal is the economic integration of the Americas (North, South and Central) through coordinated climate change policies, specifically the creation of an Inter-American carbon market, with GREEN+ being the means of implementing that market. The group focuses on “subnational” governments, namely capital cities of the Americas, thereby circumventing national governments with respect to Climate Change-related policy. </p><p>Regarding GREEN+, Sebastián Navarro, the secretary general of CC35, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/satellogic-announces-exclusive-agreement-with-green-jurisdictional-programme-to">stated of the program</a> that: “We will be relentless from the governance of the GREEN+ program with those who want to continue playing with the future of humanity,” adding that their “relentless” approach would be greatly aided by Satellogic’s satellite surveillance capabilities, which would also “generate unprecedented credibility among investors of the carbon credits produced by conservation.” Navarro’s promise to be “relentless” in governing a satellite surveillance regime of American forests for the purpose of producing “high-credibility” carbon markets.</p><figure>

R20/Catalytic Finance, like CC35, focuses its attention on “subnational” governments.</p><p>Pegasus Capital is the firm <a href="https://www.pcalp.com/about/">created by</a> Craig Cogut, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/business/ex-drexel-executives-arrange-aid-for-fruit-of-the-loom.html">a key figure</a> in the “junk bond” financial scandal at the now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel’s junk bond department, led by Michael Milken, engaged in blatantly illegal activity and used junk bonds to help fuel the takeovers of major corporations by the era’s infamous “corporate raiders” before the bank’s collapse. Specifically, Cogut was the lawyer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-10-23-fi-3113-story.html">who advised</a> the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/1991/10/13/the-definitive-account-of-the-insider-trading-scandals/">Milken-run and scandal-ridden</a> junk bond department on the legality of transactions, including those that saw Milken become a convicted felon.

Cogut left Apollo to found Pegasus in 1996 and Pegasus has since became <a href="https://www.pcalp.com/about/">a key player</a> in several UN-supported “green” finance initiatives. Cogut is also financially entangled with Satellogic’s co-founder, Emiliano Kargieman, as will be discussed later.</p><p>Cogut subsequently became<a href="https://static.sustainability.asu.edu/docs/gios_board_bios/cogut-craig.pdf"> a board member</a> of Arizona State University’s Global Institute of Sustainability, which was created by Michael Crow (and who served on the board alongside Cogut). Crow is <a href="https://www.iqt.org/about-iqt/">chairman of the board</a> of trustees In-Q-tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Cogut also served on the board of ASU’S McCain Institute, named for the late Senator John McCain, which has links to Ashton Kutcher’s <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/09/investigative-reports/ashton-kutchers-ngo-supplies-police-with-free-cia-linked-surveillance-tool-to-protect-kids/">CIA-linked charity</a> Thorn. Current <a href="https://www.mccaininstitute.org/about/leadership/">board members</a> of the McCain Institute include both Crow and former CIA director David Petraeus on its board, as well as Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who co-created the Council for Inclusive Capital with the Vatican.

Sandor had previously been deemed the “father of financial futures” and is also credited with helping create derivatives. After Drexel’s collapse, Sandor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/magazine/30carbon.html">moved on</a> to pioneering carbon emissions trading and carbon markets with the vision of creating “an all-electronic exchange for carbon trading,” a vision that has since taken shape.</p><figure>

Alessandri’s <a href="https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/nacional/region-metropolitana/2024/02/26/hassler-apunta-a-alessandri-y-pinera-por-abandono-profundo-del-centro-de-santiago.shtml">successor and supposed </a><a href="https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/nacional/region-metropolitana/2024/02/26/hassler-apunta-a-alessandri-y-pinera-por-abandono-profundo-del-centro-de-santiago.shtml">political</a><a href="https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/nacional/region-metropolitana/2024/02/26/hassler-apunta-a-alessandri-y-pinera-por-abandono-profundo-del-centro-de-santiago.shtml"> nemesis</a>, Irací Hassler of Chile’s Communist Party, has since taken over for Alessandri as CC35’s Vice President for South America. As for Nasry Asfura, he was the subject of a Honduran political scandal due to his appearance in the Pandora Papers and his alleged involvement in suspicious <a href="https://www.elclip.org/nasry-tito-asfura-pandora-papers-honduras/?lang=en">offshore finance</a> activities. He was also indicted on money laundering and fund embezzlement, but charges were dropped under Asfura’s successor Jorge Aldana, who is now president of CC35.  </p><p>The current vice president of CC35 for Central America is Mario Durán, the mayor of San Salvador and a close ally of El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele as well as a member of Bukele’s Nuevas Ideas party. Durán is poised to take over the leadership of CC35 per <a href="https://diarioelsalvador.com/alcalde-mario-duran-liderara-la-iniciativa-ciudades-capitales-de-las-americas-frente-al-cambio-climatico/413808/">a recent announcement</a> from the group. In 2021, Durán <a href="https://diariolahuella.com/alcalde-mario-duran-firma-convenio-para-capacitar-alcaldias-de-san-salvador-en-el-uso-del-bitcoin/">signed a contract</a> with CC35 regarding education about the use of Bitcoin in all metropolitan region municipalities in El Salvador, and is the only mention of CC35 promoting the use of Bitcoin. As will be noted again later on, the CC35-led GREEN+ initiative is partnered with Rootstock, which created and develops a Bitcoin sidechain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presumably, the goal is to run GREEN+’s digital carbon market on the same blockchain.</p><p>While it may seem odd to an American audience that “regional integration” efforts under the guise of climate change would be led largely by right-leaning politicians, it is important to point out that such integration efforts have historically been led by both left and right factions in Latin America, who compete for dominance over the region. For instance, right-leaning efforts at economically and/or politically integrating the Americas include Mercosur (the Southern Common Market, now <a href="https://www.a24.com/politica/javier-milei-recibio-al-presidente-paraguay-y-hablaron-del-vinculo-bilateral-y-la-agenda-del-mercosur-n1293077">championed</a> by the “anti-globalist” Javier Milei) and Prosur (Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America, launched by Chile’s center-right Piñera). Left-leaning efforts include ALADI (Latin American Integration Association) and UNASUR (Union of South American Nations). All of these efforts have failed due to geopolitical disagreements mainly centered around whether to grant membership to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and others with governments estranged from the so-called “Washington consensus” or, more recently, efforts to forge closer ties to Russia and/or China. Given that several important Latin American countries can suddenly change what side of the “consensus” they are on depending on presidential election results, such as recently happened in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/03/latin-america-currency-union-argentina-brazil-el-sur/673449/">Brazil and </a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/03/latin-america-currency-union-argentina-brazil-el-sur/673449/">Argentina</a>, these regional integration efforts have failed to gain significant traction over the last several decades. Nevertheless, the end goal of economic integration begetting political integration <a href="https://www.globe-project.eu/en/institutional-design-what-do-aladi-mercosur-and-unsaur-have-in-common-and-what-does-it-tell-us-about-south-american-regional-organizations_15379">remains the same</a>. Thus, as CC35 shows, the push to regionally integrate Latin America has now, very quietly, pivoted away from engagement at the national level to the subnational level.  </p><figure>

                    <h2>The Club of Rome’s Global Footprint</h2><p>While CC35 is the most visible face of GREEN+’s governing body, it is actually chaired by a group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN). The GFN exists to promote “<a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/">the Ecological Footprint</a>, which tracks how much nature we use and how much we have, as an accounting tool” for green finance initiatives and originated the concept of “ecological debt” based on that metric. Elsewhere, the GFN calls for “one-planet prosperity” and emphasizes climate finance, a field dominated by predatory Wall Street banks and billionaires, as an economic imperative. They work with governments at both the national and subnational level and establish the carbon emissions limits for localities, states and countries that programs like GREEN+ seek to enforce with satellite surveillance and binding contractual obligations.</p><p>The GFN is intimately connected to the Club of Rome. For instance, GFN’s founder and a member of its board, Mathis Wackernagel, who also co-created the Ecological Footprint concept, is <a href="https://www.clubofrome.org/member/wackernagel-mathis/">a member</a> of the Club of Rome. Wackernagel’s former mentor and the <a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/about-us/our-history/">other developer</a> of the Ecological Footprint, William Rees, was <a href="https://canadiancor.com/dr-william-rees-on-the-virtues-of-self-delusion-or-maybe-not/">a member</a> of the Club of Rome until 2018. Heiko Specking, a GFN <a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/about-us/people/">board member</a>, is also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinnkraut/details/experience/">affiliated with</a> the Club of Rome as is another GFN board member, <a href="http://Akenji/">Lewis Akenji</a>.  </p><p>The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 by the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King. Its earliest success was the 1972 report and later book “<a href="https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/">The </a><a href="https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/">Limits to Growth</a>," which was based on an MIT study and claimed that “if the world’s consumption patterns and population growth continued at the same high rates of the time, the earth would strike its limits within a century.” The book was heavily promoted by the earliest annual meetings of the World Economic Forum, particularly in 1973.  </p><p>Peccei, who spent a large part of his life living in Argentina, had previously been a member of ADELA, the Atlantic Community Development Group for Latin America. ADELA was composed of powerful Western companies that pooled money to invest in Latin American companies of their choosing, essentially “king-making” the titans of the Latin American corporate world.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/private-aid-to-private-enterprise-financing-businesses-in-latin.html"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/private-aid-to-private-enterprise-financing-businesses-in-latin.html">ADELA’s backers</a> <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,875701,00.html">included</a> Bank of America, IBM, Fiat (where Peccei was an executive), and the Rockefeller family’s Standard Oil. The group was part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/private-aid-to-private-enterprise-financing-businesses-in-latin.html">the Rockefeller-dominated </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/private-aid-to-private-enterprise-financing-businesses-in-latin.html">network</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/private-aid-to-private-enterprise-financing-businesses-in-latin.html"> in Latin America</a>, which also included the <a href="https://radio.uchile.cl/2017/03/21/a-los-101-anos-muere-david-rockefeller-el-gran-amigo-americano-de-agustin-edwards/">International Basic Economy Corporation</a> (IBEC), which <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/chile/2017-04-25/agustin-edwards-declassified-obituary">has been linked to</a> the 1973 CIA-backed military coup in Chile through the Chilean Rockefeller associate Agustín Edwards, and Deltec, best known today as <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2023/12/investigative-reports/unmasking-farmington-ftx-fluent-finance-and-the-coming-digital-dollar/">a main bank</a> for the failed crypto exchange FTX and its <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/deltec-bank-implicated-in-alleged-tether-manipulation-scheme/ar-BB1it1h7">close relationship </a>with the stablecoin Tether. Modern iterations of this network include Endeavor and the Council of the Americas (CoA), which will be discussed in the second part of this series. Notably, it was Peccei’s speech at an ADELA conference that <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/abs/born-in-the-corridors-of-the-oecd-the-forgotten-origins-of-the-club-of-rome-transnational-networks-and-the-1970s-in-global-history/0441CA6588F99F0825D8FF5F45401FC0">spurred his partnership</a> with Alexander King and led to the Club of Rome’s formation.  </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0OleMPLmn0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>At the time he got involved with Peccei and made the Club of Rome, King was head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD was originally established as the OEEC to help administer the post-WWII, US-developed Marshall Plan and was later expanded to become a global organization in 1961. The US remains the OECD’s <a href="https://www.oecd.org/about/budget/member-countries-budget-contributions.htm">main funder</a> by a significant margin. The group has <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-017-9553-1_191-1">long claimed</a> to promote “sustainable economic growth” and “consistently improving standard of living in its member countries,” but – in practice – it routinely favors neoliberal policies that enrich Western-based multi-national corporations. It is <a href="https://www.oecd.org/global-relations/oecdpartnershipswithinternationalorganisations/">closely partnered</a> with entities like the IMF, the World Bank and the broader multi-lateral development banking system that <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/09/investigative-reports/sustainable-debt-slavery/">has used debt slavery </a>sold as “economic development” to privatize state-owned assets and sell them off to privileged corporate interests. That system has also been considered by the US military to be part of its arsenal of “<a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2024/02/investigative-reports/tokenized-inc-blackrocks-plan-to-own-the-fractionalized-world/">financial weapons</a>” used to protect US interests abroad.</p><p>The Club of Rome was criticized for many decades for embracing <a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/33719">neo-Malthusian thought</a> (i.e. eugenics and specifically population control measures in the developing world) as well as for promoting <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/11/investigative-reports/the-club-of-rome-and-the-rise-of-the-predictive-modelling-mafia/">greater </a><a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/11/investigative-reports/the-club-of-rome-and-the-rise-of-the-predictive-modelling-mafia/">global governance</a>. Some of its members have championed the imposition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojK05pVOlhs&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Funlimitedhangout.com%2F&feature=emb_imp_woyt">a “benevolent” global dictatorship</a>. Criticisms of the Club of Rome have been voiced by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985399">academia</a> as well as <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/11/investigative-reports/the-club-of-rome-and-the-rise-of-the-predictive-modelling-mafia/">independent </a>and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/population-control-movement-climate-malthusian-similarities/673450/">mainstream media</a>. The group’s attempt to rebrand as an environmental group in order to gain popular support for those same policies was discussed in their 1991 book “<a href="https://archive.org/details/TheFirstGlobalRevolution/page/n85/mode/2up?q=the+real+enemy">The First Global Revolution</a>,” which states:</p><blockquote><p> “In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.”</p></blockquote><p>The Global Footprint Network’s methods, products and ideology are very much aligned with the neo-Malthusian “Limits to Growth” view of the Club of Rome as well as the efforts to incorporate nature into financial markets via so-called “nature-based solutions.” Indeed, the GFN’s ecological footprint metric is promoted by groups like the World Economic Forum and the World Wildlife Fund (where Peccei served on the board and which has long been tied to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/03/guardianobituaries.monarchy">European oligarch</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/04/wwf-international-selling-its-soul-corporations">corporate</a> interests). GFN also provides the statistical means of imposing Limits to Growth-style models that control both population levels and industrialization levels on governments by developing “ecological budgets” that, as evidenced by GREEN+, are now interfacing directly with carbon markets.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JBJyOZSnok" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Building a “GREEN” Power Monopoly</h2><p>The other member of the GREEN+ governing committee that will control the program as well as Satellogic’s surveillance data is The Energy Coalition (TEC). Notably, it was TEC’s executive director Craig Perkins who said that GREEN+ would also enable the surveillance of carbon emissions of populated areas, presumably via satellite. TEC was founded by John Phillips, who ran <a href="https://phillipsoilandgas.com/services">Phillips Energy</a> – an oil and gas company, in 1975. Since 1979, it has been closely partnered with local California governments via its Community Energy Partnership program. Currently, TEC is <a href="https://energy-is-everything.org/about">partnered with</a>, and some of its key initiatives are financed by, major California gas companies, referred to by TEC as California’s “investor-owned utilities.” These include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, SDGE and SoCalGas.  </p><p>With the backing of these major oil and gas companies, TEC assures us it is “creating the building blocks for a new energy economy.” One of its main partners in doing so is Community Electricity, which claims to be “building the NASDAQ of the clean energy field.” TEC and Community Electricity, which is <a href="https://www.communityelectricity.io/">backed by Google</a>, have co-designed “a master plan” financed by the California Energy Commission “to implement the largest and first-of-its-kind decarbonization by electrification protocols using DERs [<a href="https://www.energy.gov/femp/distributed-energy-resources-resilience">distributed energy resources</a>], carbon emissions management, blockchain, AI and IoT [internet of things] all connected under one plug-and-play platform.” Community Electric designs, funds and develops this technology for GluHomes (formerly GluEnergy), its parent company which shares the same founder as Community Electricity – Felipe Cano. The program is <a href="https://www.smart-energy.com/smart-grid/los-angeles-hosts-worlds-largest-blockchain-enabled-advanced-energy-community/">being piloted</a> in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as well as in disadvantaged communities in Colombia. The goal, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/community-electricity-and-energy-web-announce-partnership-to-bring-decentralized-tech-to-2f105150a3db">per Cano</a>, is to “bring the Americas together” through an inter-continental, “clean” smart grid.  </p><figure>

As previously mentioned, RSK is a founding member of GREEN+. The initiative involving TEC, Community Electricity, California’s government, and RSK <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/08/07/california-agency-backs-green-energy-pilot-using-rsks-bitcoin-smart-contracts/">also see</a><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/08/07/california-agency-backs-green-energy-pilot-using-rsks-bitcoin-smart-contracts/">ks</a> “to digitize carbon credit reporting” and to “create opportunities for businesses to redeem credits.” The Community Electricity/TEC program also uses the RSK blockchain to record a person’s energy usage “with the help of RIF, an identity product [i.e. digital identity] developed by RSK Labs.” The Community Electricity system requires a digital ID tied to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240313092108/https://gluenergy.io/en/new-glu-energy/">a digital wallet</a> that “is embedded to store daily profits derived from surplus energy sales” that allow electricity consumers to trade energy credits and become what the company calls “prosumers,” with the goal of creating “an energy social network.” The Community Electricity hardware <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240313092226/https://gluenergy.io/en/technology/">produced with</a> GluHomes also “utilize[s] AI and machine learning to transform any home intro a smart micro electricity generation utility.”  </p><p>The group is partnering with real estate developers to develop smart homes connected to their energy-related technology, with a focus on social housing and affordable housing, i.e. housing for lower income families. The goal is to connect together retro-fitted existing homes, new smart homes, a neighborhood co-op of electric vehicles and a reward-payment system called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240313092220/https://gluenergy.io/en/glu-pay/">GluPay</a>, which is partnered with Mastercard and <a href="https://www.contigo-global.com/">Contigo</a>, which designs products “for the unbanked, immigrants, homeless and disadvantaged population,” with a focus on remittance payments. Contigo is <a href="https://www.contigo-global.com/">currently in talks</a> with El Salvador’s government to have the company’s “Payments Wallet tied into the Salvadoran financial inclusion products.” Contigo is run by <a href="https://chavez.ucla.edu/person/raul-hinojosa-ojeda/">Raul Hinojosa</a>, an academic at UCLA who wrote a book entitled “Convergence and Divergence between NAFTA, Chile, and MERCOSUR: Overcoming Dilemmas of North and South American Economic Integration,” which focuses on “the impact of a potential Free Trade of the Americas Agreement.”</p><p>The creator of Community Electricity and GluHomes, Felipe Cano has also spent most of his career attempting to economically integrate large swathes of the world. For instance, in 1998, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-cano-12459224/">his vision</a> was “to unify both European and US stock exchanges under one platform and protocol, the create the smart grid of the equity market and stock trading in a bilateral, single network.” This vision led him to create ECN Access, which “was the first tech hub in Europe to route the first block of institutional order flows from a European Bank directly to the NASDAQ electronic exchange without intermediaries,” creating what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-cano-12459224/">Cano calls</a> “the first smart grid every built.” He then sought to “create a digital market for the energy sector,” which has since culminated in his creation of Community Electricity and GluHomes. Cano is an adviser to TEC and is also a senior partner at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-cano-12459224/">Silverbear Capital</a>, where he focuses on investments related to smart cities. According to <a href="https://sbcfinancialgroup.com/meet-our-team/">his bio</a> at Silverbear, Cano is also CEO of “Olidata Smart Cities LLC, a market-maker platform which uses nano-grids and microgrids as the underlying strategy to deploy the Internet of Things Protocol of the future.”</p><p>Cano was also, until recently, <a href="https://sursantiago.com.ar/politica/2021/12/07/zamora-se-reunio-con-el-presidente-de-la-global-carbon-parks-felipe-cano">the president</a> of <a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">Global Carbon Parks</a>, which is a consortium of companies, the only known members of which all happen to be <a href="https://carbonparks.cc35.city/">companies that founded</a> GREEN+, with the one exception being Cano’s Community Electricity. Global Carbon Parks, unsurprisingly, is now <a href="https://globalcarbonparks.com/services.html">one of the main implementers</a> of the GREEN+ program. Global Carbon Parks is also partnered with <a href="https://www.aclima.io/about">Aclima</a>, a start-up backed by Microsoft and the foundation of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Global Carbon Park’s stated mission is to “transform protected areas into natural equity” via public-private partnerships, essentially admitting that the GREEN+ program it now helps manage is about financializing protected natural assets and resources.  </p><figure>

                    <p> Global Carbon Parks “transforms” these forests into “natural equity” by measuring, certifying and trading carbon credits in conjunction with the carbon credit certification Cercarbono (discussed later in this article). Their <a href="https://globalcarbonparks.com/services.html">partnership with Satellogic</a>, which goes beyond but also includes the GREEN+ program, uses satellite surveillance “to ensure the integrity of the preserved area” which contains the carbon represented by the carbon credits. The company <a href="https://globalcarbonparks.com/services.html">also promotes</a> their integration with The Energy Coalition and Community Electricity to develop “advanced electricity communities” that develop “renewable energy credits," which the company claims will “contribute to local wealth creation.” The company is partnered with a financial firm, which does the actual trading of carbon credits for both Global Carbon Parks and presumably GREEN+. However, Global Carbon Parks declines to reveal their identity, merely stating that “They are a financial firm that integrates technical, economic, and environmental solutions.”</p><p>In summary, the governance of the GREEN+ program and the group with control over its satellite surveillance data; are tied to or funded by groups that have long used debt as a form of control over the Global South in particular; seek to control the population size and the degree of industrialization in countries; are tied to globalist efforts to economically and politically integrate the Americas; are building a Bitcoin blockchain-based smart grid that surveils and limits energy usage and links energy usage to currency; and are integrating and tokenizing the natural world, including endangered or protected areas, into the financial system under the guise of conservation. Through CC35’s Alcades por el Clima (Mayors for the Climate) initiative, over 15,000 local governments in Latin America <a href="https://www.alcaldesporelclima.org/">have signed agreements</a> with CC35 related to carbon emission trading schemes and limits, led by Brazil (5,564 local governments), Argentina (2,457 local governments), and Mexico (2,481 local governments). Presumably, those carbon neutrality/trading agreements will allow CC35 to push those municipalities into the GREEN+ program, if they aren’t already planning to participate directly (many are).</p><p> In other words, the vast majority of Latin America, unbeknownst to the vast majority of its populace, is already contractually yoked to one of the main organizations behind the GREEN+ program – run by interests tied to foreign banks, corporations and even intelligence services. The program is set to launch continent-wide in a matter of weeks. As this article and subsequent article will show, what has transpired is a brazen attempt to conduct a silent coup of the continent’s natural resources, energy production, local governments and economy.</p><h2>The GREEN+ Trust and the Bitcoin Carbon Market</h2><p>The GREEN+ Trust, which is to hold and handle the profits from the carbon credits produced and then disburse them to governments if certain conditions are met, is to be <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220427141745/https://www.cercarbono.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GREEN-Jurisdictional-Programme-Description.pdf">managed by</a> individuals “selected from the members institutions of the [GREEN+] Executive Board” as well as from Isolas, Lockton and Rootstock (RSK). According to GREEN+, the Trust is not only responsible for fund custody, but also “the regulation of smart contracts, in coordination with the certification standard [Cercarbono] and the monitoring of mitigation initiatives [conducted by Satellogic].” The only known member of the Trust, as previously mentioned, is Alejandro Guerrero, the head of Lockton’s branch in Argentina and Uruguay. </p><p>Lockton, a founding member of GREEN+ and also of Global Carbon Parks, is the world’s largest, privately held insurance brokerage firm that also provides risk management services, employee benefits and retirement services. They are owned by the Lockton family and the company – and the family behind it – are rather secretive. However, the company has been overt about the opportunities they see in the type of carbon market that initiatives like GREEN+ will create.</p><p>In a 2023 article, Lockton’s head of Digital Integration and Special Projects, David Briscoe, <a href="https://global.lockton.com/gb/en/news-insights/making-carbon-dioxide-credits-a-strong-currency">wrote that</a> making carbon credits “a stable and trusted currency” would “require the support of the insurance market.” This is because, as Briscoe notes, “voluntary” carbon markets come with risks, particularly because “of the financial values involved.” Per Briscoe, these risks include “non- or under-delivery of forward purchased carbon removal credits," “start-ups involved in the voluntary carbon market may face insolvency risks,” and “fraud and negligence.” Indeed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/24/carbon-credit-speculators-could-lose-billions-as-offsets-deemed-worthless-aoe">mismanagement and fraud</a> has been <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/02/1082765/the-growing-signs-of-trouble-for-global-carbon-markets/">a major driver</a> of why carbon markets have failed to catch on despite relentless promotion and the adoption of ESG and climate change plans by many of the most powerful names in finance and industry. Instead of addressing the rampant fraud in carbon credits directly, it appears that the high probability of fraud and insolvency has been seen as an opportunity to create a new market for the insurance industry, with carbon credit insurance being framed as the only “feasible” means of de-risking the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/australias-carbon-credits-system-a-failure-on-global-scale-study-finds">fraud-prone world</a> of carbon markets, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/reuters-impact-greenpeace-calls-end-carbon-offsets-2021-10-06/">have been criticized</a> by environmental groups and <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/podcasts/kpbs-midday-edition-segments/2019/05/28/propublica-carbon-credits-dont-fight-climate-chang">have been shown</a> to have a negligible impact on climate.  </p><p>Lockton offers a variety of products related to carbon credits and so do its competitors, with the first such insurance having been issued by the UK-based insurance company Howden in 2022. That product was <a href="https://www.howdengroup.com/news-and-insights/Howden-launches-World-First-voluntary-carbon-credit-insurance-product-to-help-scale-the-market">designed to</a> “increase confidence in the Voluntary Carbon Market” and was “incubated” in collaboration with “the Insurance Task Force of the Sustainable Markets Initiative; an initiative led by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales [now King Charles].” Industry publications have <a href="https://www.theinsurer.com/news/carbon-credits-the-next-1bn-insurance-market/">openly posited</a> that carbon credits are likely to be “the next $1 billion insurance market.” Some companies, like <a href="https://www.kita.earth/">Kita</a> and <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/cloverly-and-oka-launch-a-new-suit-of-insured-carbon-credits/">Oka</a>, were created specifically to insure carbon credits. Presumably, Lockton’s involvement with GREEN+ means that Lockton will be insuring the mass of carbon credits to be produced by the program, which plans to harvest carbon credits from all of the world’s “subnational protected areas.” In addition, Lockton’s role as the carbon credits insurer means it will be involved in ensuring that those cities/regions that are to become part of GREEN+ comply with the program’s stipulations in order to receive funds from the trust.</p><figure>

                    <p>Another member of the GREEN+ Trust is RSK, or Rootstock. RSK is a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/federated-sidechains-bitcoin-original">federated sidechain</a> built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows smart contract functionality akin to the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the same programming language known as Solidity. In effect, this means that <em>any</em> smart contract that can be designed and authored on Ethereum, such as identity systems, dollar-pegged stablecoins, or tokenized carbon credits, can be “trivially” ported to Bitcoin. The concept of Bitcoin sidechains was first introduced in <a href="https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf">October 2014</a> by a group of Bitcoin developers mainly employed by Blockstream, whose <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-seed--3fcfe8a5">November 2014 seed round</a> was led by Reid Hoffman, that gives “bitcoins and other ledger assets” the ability to be “transferred between multiple blockchains” giving new functionality to “assets they already own” without compromising any of the security innate to Bitcoin's blockchain. RSK works by allowing <a href="https://dev.rootstock.io/rsk/architecture/">users to deposit funds</a> sent using traditional bitcoin transactions into a wallet controlled by a federation (in this case, a known group of Rootstock-selected key signers) that issues a 1:1 token called Smart Bitcoin, represented by RBTC, which fuels the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine), a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). RBTC is “the native currency” of Rootstock, and is used to pay for the fees required to complete and settle the smart contracts or transactions that take place on the RSK sidechain.  </p><p>RSK was launched in 2015 by RSK Labs, which was <a href="https://blog.rootstock.io/noticia/iov-labs-launch/">acquired by</a> RIF Labs before becoming IOV (“internet of value”) Labs. IOV labs, as of last week, has rebranded once again to become <a href="https://www.rootstocklabs.com/">RootstockLabs</a>. It was co-founded by Sergio Lerner, who <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2014/12/05/bitcoin-foundation-hires-developer-sergio-lerner-for-full-time-security-role/">became</a> the Bitcoin Foundation’s bitcoin core security auditor the same year he conceived of RSK, and Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar. Gutierrez is the <a href="https://www.iovlabs.org/about-us.html">current chairman</a> of RootstockLabs, while Lerner is its chief scientist and they are the president and vice president, respectively, of the <a href="https://www.iovf.org/about-us/">IOV Foundation</a>, which enables “interventions that contribute to sustainable development," specifically the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on emerging markets and territories. A major goal of the SDGs is <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/11/investigative-reports/un-backed-banker-alliance-announces-green-plan-to-transform-the-global-financial-system/">to create</a> a new global financial governance system. That system <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2019/the-growing-challenges-for-monetary-policy-speech-by-mark-carney.pdf">has been described</a> in recent years by top UN climate finance official, central banker, and ex-Goldman Sachs executive Mark Carney, as relying largely on programmable, surveillable digital currencies (namely central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs) and a global carbon market.</p><p>According to RootstockLabs and its affiliated foundation, the group’s <a href="https://www.iovf.org/about-us/">mission</a> is to harness “the power of digital technology, blockchain, and collaboration” to “break down barriers and create a more equitable society.” They also state that Rootstock Labs <a href="https://www.iovf.org/about-us/">was created</a> with the intent of creating “a new open financial ecosystem,” while <a href="https://rif.technology/about/">RIF Labs</a> states it (along with RootstockLabs) is “creating a global financial system that works for everyone.”</p><figure>

                    <p>Diego Gutierrez is a long-time associate of Wenceslao (Wences) Casares, an Argentine tech entrepreneur sometimes referred to as the “<a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201112/argentine-entrepreneur-750-million-mistake.html">Peter Thiel of Latin America</a>.” Gutierrez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegogutierrezzaldivar/details/experience/">worked </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegogutierrezzaldivar/details/experience/">with</a> Casares at Argentina’s first Internet service provider, which Casares had launched, and then helped create the Casares-founded Argentinian online brokerage firm Patagon that was later sold to Spanish banking giant Santander. Casares, like Gutierrez, is a long-time promoter and early adopter of Bitcoin and is allegedly responsible for pitching the promise of Bitcoin to elites, like Bill Gates and LinkedIn/PayPal’s Reid Hoffman. Hoffman <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/11/wences-casares-the-bitcoin-obsessed-serial-entrepreneur/">once referred</a> to Casares as Bitcoin’s “patient zero” in terms of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/01/15/paypals-wences-casares-i-can-imagine-a-world-in-which-bitcoin-becomes-a-global-standard-of-value/?sh=78220b2063b5">Silicon Valley’s interest</a> in Bitcoin.<em> Forbes </em><a href="https://archive.md/Bvtfe">has </a><a href="https://archive.md/Bvtfe">even </a><a href="https://archive.md/Bvtfe">referred</a> to Casares as “crypto royalty who ran with the original gang of Bitcoin OGs.” Casares subsequently became <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/PayPal-Appoints-Wences-Casares-to-its-Board-of-Directors">a board member</a> of PayPal and also part of Facebook’s failed stablecoin project Libra/Diem.

Garcia is <a href="https://www.xapobank.com/about-us">also listed</a> as being Xapo’s Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer. Garcia is <a href="https://gibraltarlawyers.com/people/joey-garcia/">a lawyer </a><a href="https://gibraltarlawyers.com/people/joey-garcia/">for and head of the fintech team</a> at the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas, which is also part of the GREEN+ group and manages the GREEN+ Trust alongside RSK and Lockton. Both Xapo and RSK’s parent, Rootstock Labs, are based in Gibraltar – a UK overseas territory, where Garcia <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/85755/gibraltar-extends-regulatory-guidelines-for-digital-asset-exchanges">helped develop and lobby for</a> crypto regulations with hopes of having that regulatory regime influence coming regulations in the US and Europe. Garcia is also <a href="https://gibraltarlawyers.com/people/joey-garcia/">connected to</a> UN initiatives on digital currencies, with a focus on regulation and law enforcement.</p><p>The involvement of this network in GREEN+ speaks to an effort to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain in the creation of a new global financial system centered around digital currencies and carbon markets. As carbon markets have developed, it <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/21/unleashing-the-green-economy-how-blockchain-can-transform-climate-friendly-investment-opportunities/">has become clear </a>that the carbon market which central and commercial bankers wish to build (with UN backing) will be blockchain-based and that carbon credits will be tokenized and traded on digital exchanges, such as the Goldman Sachs and <a href="https://xpansiv.com/blackstone-announces-400-million-investment-in-xpansiv/">Blackstone-backed</a> Xpansiv, which is <a href="https://xpansiv.com/partnerships/">partnered with</a> GREEN+ members Cercarbono and EcoRegistry.  </p><p>There are efforts to make Bitcoin the blockchain on which these markets (or at least key parts of them) will run, hence the relatively recent effort to create a more “sustainable” and “net zero” Bitcoin. RSK is clearly part of this effort, as evidenced by their involvement in GREEN+, where they are managing the smart contracts of GREEN+ carbon credits, as well as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/08/07/california-agency-backs-green-energy-pilot-using-rsks-bitcoin-smart-contracts/">their partnership</a> with the California Energy Commission and GREEN+ member The Energy Coalition on creating “an experimental market for carbon credit trading” on top of Bitcoin.  </p><p>The importance of RSK within the maturation of the carbon credit market in the blockchain era is two-fold; the direct and immediate interoperability between tokenized assets representing green finance instruments and bitcoin, and the leveraging of the most distributed and most secure blockchain in the world, Bitcoin, as a universal ledger for the execution and settlement of otherwise impossible smart contracts. Rootstock allows Bitcoin the protocol to become the enabling and enforcing environment for all aspects of climate capitalism – green bond authoring and settlement, parametric insurance clauses, the tokenization of carbon emission offsets, and the <a href="https://blog.rootstock.io/noticia/stablecoins-on-bitcoin-mitigating-volatility/">issuance of dollar stablecoins</a> that denominate the entire system and globalize the US Treasury market.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>As recently mentioned, Diego Gutierrez of RSK was a very early adopter and promoter of Bitcoin and today runs Bitcoin Argentina while also being a co-founder of Latin America’s largest and oldest Bitcoin conference. In <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/negocios/diego-gutierrez-zaldivar-latinoamerica-puede-ser-pionera-en-tener-el-sistema-financiero-del-futuro/">an interview</a> with Argentinian outlet <em>La Voz</em> early last year, Gutierrez stated that, in order for Bitcoin to become part of the global financial system that is emerging, there would have to be a “trade off” that would mean stripping Bitcoin of its “ethos” and “part of its disruptive potential.” In other words, in Gutierrez’s view, Bitcoin must cease to be a threat to central and commercial banks as it integrates into the system those banks have designed and uphold and will become their tool. There is perhaps no greater evidence of this than the recent pivot of <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/2024/02/investigative-reports/tokenized-inc-blackrocks-plan-to-own-the-fractionalized-world/">BlackRock’s Larry Fink</a> on Bitcoin and its promise as a “technology for asset storage” and the wild success of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Gutierrez also tellingly stated in the same interview that there would soon be a move away from fiat and fiat-backed stablecoins to commodity-backed stablecoins that would make the companies and entities that control those commodities (which would include carbon in this emerging financial paradigm) more powerful than central banks and eliminate the need for central banks entirely.</p><p>Wences Casares, Gutierrez's close associate, created his bank Xapo <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2014/03/underground-vault-offers-bitcoin-protection-with-armed-guards-biometric-scanners/">to help</a> “solve the disjointed nature of our world economy” and to act as “the bridge between bitcoin, US dollars and stablecoins.” As a consequence, Xapo has been a key player in efforts to dollarize bitcoin and has developed close relationships with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xapo-bank-becomes-first-fully-171000537.html">Circle</a> (USDC), <a href="https://u.today/tether-usdt-replaces-swift-for-usd-operations-of-xapo-bank-details">Tether</a> (USDT) and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/xapo-bank-integrates-bitcoins-lightning-network-partners-with-lightspark/">Light</a><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/xapo-bank-integrates-bitcoins-lightning-network-partners-with-lightspark/">spark</a>, whose founder David Marcus <a href="https://bankautomationnews.com/allposts/payments/david-marcus-bitcoin-paypal-ceo/">invested in Xapo</a> while head of PayPal. Marcus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/technology/david-marcus-facebook-libra-diem-novi.html">also previously worked</a> for Facebook and co-created Facebook’s Libra/Diem stablecoin project, where Casares was on the board and which was allied with Xapo. Xapo’s <a href="https://archive.is/xxuLt">initial advisory board</a> was composed of former longtime head of Citibank John Reed, Visa founder Dee Hock and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. Summers is best known for <a href="https://archive.org/details/one-nation-under-blackmail-vol-1-2-whitney-alyse-webb">his close association</a> with Jeffrey Epstein and his role in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-comprehensive-case-against-larry-summers/279651/">repealing key provisions</a> of the Glass-Steagall Act at <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/how-clinton-team-thwarted-effort-to-regulate-derivatives">Citi’s behest</a>, which is widely believed to have provoked the 2008 financial crisis. While on Xapo’s board, Summers became a leading voice behind the effort to “<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/01/05/larry-summers-its-time-the-us-placed-a-price-on-carbon/">put a price on carbon</a>” and implement <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/oils-swoon-creates-the-opening-for-a-carbon-tax/2015/01/04/3db11a3a-928a-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html">carbon taxes</a> and carbon markets. In 2015, together with these men, <a href="https://archive.is/xxuLt">Xapo claimed</a>, they would build “the global bitcoin ecosystem.”</p><h2>The GREEN+ Registry</h2><p>Working closely with the GREEN+ Trust is the carbon credit certification standard chosen by GREEN+, Cercarbono. In addition to certifying the carbon credits produced by the program, Cercarbono also has a role in choosing which initiatives participating jurisdictions can implement with funds received and are also involved in fund custody alongside the GREEN+ Trust. Cercarbono <a href="https://allcottrading.com/uncategorized-en/cercarbono/">was launched</a> in 2016, shortly after Colombia – where Cercarbono was formed – passed a law establishing a carbon tax. Cercarbono’s founders created the company because the law created a “need for a national certifying entity that would provide solutions to the climate problem.” Further Colombian legislation in 2017 spurred the company to expand into carbon markets. It has since become a leading voluntary carbon credit certifier in Latin America. </p><p>In 2018, Cercarbono <a href="https://allcottrading.com/uncategorized-en/cercarbono/">formed</a> a partnership with <a href="https://www.ecoregistry.io/">EcoRegistry</a>, a blockchain registry that is also part of GREEN+ and “develops services and platforms for reporting, monitoring and registering environmental assets and carbon units.” The program says the company also “addresses the issuance, monitoring and cancellation of the carbon credits generated by the jurisdictions in close coordination with the certification standard and the Trust Fund.” EcoRegistry <a href="https://www.ecoregistry.io/how-it-works">provides</a> a unique serial number to each carbon credit issued and allows for close monitoring of that credit on-chain. As a consequence, it works closely with the lead of GREEN+’s monitoring unit, the intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic. EcoRegistry is also a part of the <a href="https://climateactiondata.org/">Climate Action Data Trust</a>, or CAD Trust. The CAD Trust was discussed in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tokenized-inc-blackrocks-plan-to-own-the-fractionalized-world-">previous reporting</a> from <em>Bitcoin Magazine </em>and <em>Unlimited Hangout </em>and is an effort led by the World Bank and funded by Google (among others) in an effort to construct what they refer to as “climate wallets.” IETA, discussed below, is <a href="https://carboncredits.com/xpansiv-cbl-to-trade-cercarbono-carbon-credits/">also a member</a> of the CAD Trust.  </p><figure>

                    <p>The World Bank has been exploring tokenization and digital ledger technology in order to create “a modular and interoperable end-to-end digital ecosystem for the carbon market.” Through the Digital for Climate (D4C) working group, the World Bank aims to build “the next generation of climate markets” by directing governments to create National Carbon Registries reliant on blockchain technology. The <a href="https://www.theclimatewarehouse.org/work/digital-4-climate">data produced by these registries</a> will be “link[ed], aggregat[ed] and harmoniz[ed]” by the CAD Trust. D4C itself leverages the Chia blockchain, developed by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen. Part of the D4C’s “Climate Tokenization Suite” includes the aforementioned Climate Wallet to facilitate the exchange of carbon credit tokens, requiring an active connection to a Climate Action Data Trust node to function.</p><p>EcoRegistry is also part of the Climate Chain Coalition, whose other members include disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann’s new venture Flowcarbon, the Cardano Foundation, the Google-backed oracle service Chainlink, and <a href="https://www.sustainablebtc.org/">the Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol</a> (SBP), which seeks to “encourage [bitcoin] miners to utilize environmentally friendly energy sources using tokenization.” The SBP aims to turn “sustainability into an investable asset” when they create what they refer to as <a href="https://www.sustainablebtc.org/sustainable-bitcoin-certificate">a Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate</a> (SBC), a verified “on-chain environmental asset” representing “bitcoin mined using clean energy.”  </p><p>The SBP website further specifies the incentivized opportunity for additional revenue streams for Bitcoin miners, stating that “unlike carbon credits or RECs which are retired," each individual SBC is a tokenized asset which “permanently represents the sustainability of one bitcoin.” Due to an upcoming 50% reduction in the rate of bitcoin issued per block – referred to as a “halving” – alternative sources of income for miners can be the difference between thriving and barely surviving in such an unforgiving market. While initially issued alongside the mining of every new bitcoin, the SBC itself can later be sold to other investors. Depending on future regulations of energy in relation to Bitcoin mining operations in the United States, non-mining businesses might look to purchase these certificates from miners as a means to offset the carbon footprint of their bitcoin holdings.  </p><p>In effect, the SBP aims to incentivize carbon neutrality for Bitcoin miners while simultaneously allowing investors to meet ESG goals while holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, the latter exemplified in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230323005663/en/Sustainable-Bitcoin-Protocol-partners-with-BitGo-to-Launch-the-First-Sustainable-Custody-Solution-for-Bitcoin">their partnership</a> with Bitcoin custodian BitGo. Their website explains that they “believe Bitcoin has a unique potential to expedite the clean energy transition” and due to being “the world’s first commodity derived from a network,” every bitcoin mined is “fully fungible in both price and also carbon footprint” – culminating in a “sustainability opportunity unlike any other industry." If a large company with a large carbon output ­due in large part to the sheer energy demands of being a multi-national company – traveling employees, large scale data centers, and simply offices that require electricity – was holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, they could purchase large amounts of SBCs to source yield on the appreciating certificate token while also generating accounting opportunities to reach metric-based ESG goals faster.  </p><p>The co-founder of SBP, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-twomey-32247028/">Matthew Twomey</a>, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, OSL and Deutsche Bank, while Head of Climate Strategy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-david-101/details/experience/">Elliot David </a>previously held positions at the US Department of Energy, as well as worked with the Clinton Foundation within their Clinton Climate Initiative on their Island Energy Program. Listed among the <a href="https://www.sustainablebtc.org/about">SBP Advisors</a> are Natasha Barrientos (S&P Global and the United Nations), Dr. Julia Nesheiwat (the Atlantic Council), Emma Todd (World Economic Forum) and Kelvin Chang (Coinbase and Microsoft).</p><p>Cercarbono and EcoRegistry share several noteworthy partners and affiliations. For example, both are members of <a href="https://asocarbono.org/membresias/">Asocarbono</a>, an alliance of different companies and actors running or supporting Colombian carbon markets, that has written about the issue of <a href="https://asocarbono.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/documento-concepto-juridico-derecho-de-carbono-en-Colombia.pdf">“carbon rights”</a> within voluntary carbon markets. According to<a href="https://www.un-redd.org/post/carbon-rights-and-importance-benefit-sharing"> the UN</a>, “carbon rights” “comprises two fundamental concepts: 1) the property rights to sequester and store carbon, contained in land, trees, soil, etc. and 2) the right to benefits that arise from the transfer of these property rights (i.e. through emissions trading schemes).” The issue itself portends the possibility that those who purchase carbon credits will obtain the “property rights” of the carbon sequestered in trees and other natural elements found in the area tied to those carbon credits, opening the door to land grabs through carbon markets. Notably, there is no clear definition of carbon rights and it is unclear, due to the fact that their contracts with jurisdictions/governments are not publicly available, how GREEN+ views the issue of carbon rights in relation to property rights.</p><figure>

                    <p>EcoRegistry and Cercarbono are also both <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/acx-partners-with-ecoregistry-and-cercarbono-to-promote-carbon-offsetting-through-the-use-of-technology-and-innovation-301873769.html">partnered with AirCarbon Exchange (ACX</a>), “the world's first fully digital carbon exchange,” established in 2019 with the Singapore Sustainable Energy Association – subsidized by the Singapore government's Enterprise Singapore ­– and <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/unfccc-partners-with-the-aircarbon-exchange-to-promote-carbon-offsetting">backed by the UN</a>. ACX was founded by <a href="https://acx.net/team-showcase/thomas-mcmahon/">CEO Thomas McMahon</a>, an over 30 year veteran of the commodities and derivatives industry, having spent over 20 years at the New York Mercantile Exchange before establishing himself in Singapore, where ACX is based. ACX is Singapore's first international carbon credit exchange, <a href="https://d1qfwzw6aggd4h.cloudfront.net/about/NICMR-SG-Carbon-Credit-Trading-A4_2022-10-19-145836_qzqc.pdf">chosen by McMahon</a> “due to demand for carbon credits from the airline industry.” The exchange uses distributed ledger technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain, to trade six different tokenized carbon credits, boasting settlement for “as low as $3 per 1,000 CO2 tonnes.” While ACX began mainly by focusing on the airline industry, the exchange now has over 160 clients ranging from financial institutions to project developers. Between January and August 2021, over 5.7 million CO2 tonnes were traded on the exchange. Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, <a href="https://carboncredits.com/abu-dhabi-wealth-fund-mubadala-invests-acquires-stake-acx/">acquired a 20% stake</a> in the company, with the intent to build a carbon exchange in the UAE. ACX is <a href="https://acx.net/about-us/">also partnered</a> with IETA (more on them below), as well as the Carbon Business Council, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). It can be assumed that ACX will be the exchange on which GREEN+ carbon credits will be traded due to its partnerships with GREEN+’s credit certifier and registry.  </p><p> Both Cercarbono and EcoRegistry were also recently integrated into Xpansiv, which “operates the leading multi-registry, multi-asset environmental portfolio management system and market data service” as well as <a href="https://xpansiv.com/xpansiv-to-license-key-intellectual-property/">CBL</a>, the “largest spot exchange for environmental commodities, including carbon credits and renewable energy certificates.” Xpansiv is backed by Blackstone, which poured <a href="https://xpansiv.com/blackstone-announces-400-million-investment-in-xpansiv/">$400 million</a> into the company, with other investors including British Petroleum (BP) Ventures, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Xpansiv’s CBL <a href="https://xpansiv.com/geo/">has partnered</a> <a href="https://xpansiv.com/n-geo/">extensively</a> with CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group, which is one of the world’s main derivatives exchanges, and together they have produced several futures contracts on carbon markets.  </p><p> Cercarbono and EcoRegistry also both share an affiliation with the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA. Founded in 1999 <a href="https://unctad.org/press-material/international-emissions-trading-association-established-unctads-help">under the auspices of the UN</a>, IETA “is dedicated to the establishment of linked trading systems to ensure efficient and competitive GHG [greenhouse gas] markets.” Its inaugural members included the titans of the oil and manufacturing industries. <a href="https://www.ieta.org/memberships/#members">Current members</a> include AngloAmerican mining, Saudi Aramco, Bank of America, Bayer/Monsanto, Cargill, Chevron, Citi Group, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, PetroChina and the <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/world/billionaire-trader-who-funded-mossad-buried-in-israel-1.46339">Mossad-linked</a> commodities company Glencore. Another company that is a member of IETA is StoneX, which is partnered with the aforementioned exchange ACX and is sponsoring the launch of GREEN+ satellites in Miami later this month. IETA is also <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221206005837/en/IETA-and-Founding-Partners-Announce-the-Launch-of-Climate-Action-Data-Trust">part of</a> the aforementioned Climate Action Data Trust, along with EcoRegistry, the World Bank and others.</p><p>IETA is also <a href="https://www.ieta.org/initiatives/icroa/">notably behind</a> the ICROA accreditation program, which Cercarbono and most other carbon credit certification standards of note have received. These include the world’s leading carbon credit certifier Verra, which was recently embroiled in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe">a major scandal</a> when it was revealed that 90% of their most common category of carbon credits were “worthless” despite being ICROA (and IETA) approved.</p><figure>

                    <h2>Satellogic - Observation Is Preservation</h2><p>As the digital carbon credit industry grows into a multi-trillion dollar market upheld by smart contracts on a distributed ledger, so too does the need for participants to access metric-specific data to insure the eventual pay outs of green bonds. For example, the company Atos, best known for its <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/partners/atos">Olympic Games IT partnership</a> since 1989, raised $916 million in sustainability-linked bonds at the end of 2021. According to <a href="https://atos.net/en/2021/press-release_2021_11_04/sustainability-linked-bond">a press release in November 2021</a>, the bonds were issued with “an eight-year maturity and one percent coupon,” with a clause that the annual interest rate paid during the “last three years will be unchanged if the company reduces its annual GreenHouse Gas CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 & 3) by 50 percent in 2025 compared to 2019.” While these particular bonds were not authored using a blockchain, there remains the now-sudden economic incentive – a one percent coupon on nearly $1 billion – to deliver <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/guest-blog-how-satellite-imagery-can-support-a-net-zero-transition.html">verifiable real world data</a> to the participants, the state of which determines the eventual payout. These bonds were issued with BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan acting as Global Coordinators and with Joint Bookrunners such as HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Banco Santander, Bank of America Securities, and Wells Fargo Securities, among others, with Rothschild & Co “acting as financial advisor to Atos SE.” An <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/atos-raises-800-million-in-sustainability-linked-bonds/">article from Data Center Dynamic</a>s on the raise makes note of the common trend of “sustainability-linked financing” among data center and communication firms, referencing how <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ntt-announces-27-billion-green-bond-to-support-carbon-neutral-goals/">NTT</a>, <a href="http://Aligned/">Aligned</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/airtrunk-converts-1545bn-financing-into-sustainability-linked-loans/">Airtrunk</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/kpn-concludes-1-billion-sustainability-linked-loan/">KPN</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/baidu-announces-1-billion-esg-bond-offering/">Baidu</a>, and <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nabiax-ties-320-million-financing-to-esg-targets/">Nabiax</a> all raised “funds or converted existing debt to include interest rates tied to sustainability and ESG goals” within the last year.</p><figure>

                    <p>When the eventual payout of billions of dollars in cleverly-authored green bonds comes down to accurate measurements of carbon molecule density over a vast land mass, such as a South American rainforest, the market for reliable data service providers has quite literally left the atmosphere. As the debt instruments of the private sector evolve alongside the proliferation of blockchain technology, the data that makes these smart contracts execute to eventually settle the issued bond no longer goes to a human arbitrator, but rather a consciousness-free protocol that reduces a pair of potential outcomes to a single output. In the case of a sustainability-linked green bond, if the carbon emissions of a business are not empirically reduced beyond a relative metric at a certain time – both data points of which are determined at the issuance of the smart contract and thus willingly agreed-upon by both parties – the coupon on the bond is not paid out. With the carbon credit market presenting itself as one of the preferred debt instruments of the modern era, the aforementioned Satellogic – an intelligence-linked company focused on privatizing the data from satellite surveillance with an advisory board full of key players in the digital debt system – finds itself ready to act as a crucial pillar of the encroaching new financial system.  </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Satellogic was co-founded in 2010 by <a href="https://investors.satellogic.com/management/emiliano-kargieman">Emiliano Kargieman</a>, its current CEO, and <a href="https://investors.satellogic.com/management/gerardo-richarte">Gerardo Richarte</a>, its current CTO, after spending “some time” at the NASA Ames Campus in Mountain View, CA. According to press releases on <a href="https://satellogic.com/news/press-releases/satellogic-elects-tom-killalea-to-its-board-of-directors/">their website</a>, Satellogic is “the first vertically integrated geospatial company” that is building “the first scalable, fully automated EO [Earth Observation] platform” with capabilities to “remap the entire planet at both high-frequency and high-resolution” in order to generate “accessible and affordable solutions for customers.” Their listed mission is “to democratize access to geospatial data through its information platform of high-resolution images and analytics” to help solve the world’s most pressing problems” of which they list “climate change, energy supply, and food security.” Other Satellogic documentation reveals that by “democratize," they mean expand satellite surveillance from the public sector (i.e. governments and security agencies) into the private sector. Due to their “patented Earth imaging technology,” Satellogic “unlocks the power of EO” to deliver “high-quality, planetary insights” at “the lowest cost in the industry.”</p><p>Both Kargieman and Richarte previously worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Security_Technologies">Core Security Technologies</a>, which Kargieman co-founded, with clients such as Apple, Cisco, Homeland Security, NSA, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and DARPA. In 1998, Core Security was recognized as an "Endeavor Entrepreneur" by the Endeavor Foundation and in 2002, Morgan Stanley invested $1.5 million into Core Security, with the bank gaining a seat on the board. The company was also funded by Bank of America in its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/courion-corporation/company_financials/investors">Series A</a>. Kargieman later founded Aconcagua Ventures in a joint venture with Craig Cogut’s Pegasus Capital, and served as a Member of the Special Projects Group at the World Bank. As previously noted, Cogut’s Pegasus Capital is also a main funder of CC35. Another Core Security Technologies employee that migrated to Satellogic with Kargeiman and Richarte is <a href="https://investors.satellogic.com/management/aviv-cohen">Aviv Cohen</a>, a former Israeli intelligence officer who is now Satellogic’s head of “special projects.”</p><p>Satellogic's <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/satellogic-seed--009729ec">seed round raise</a> was funded by Ariel Arrieta and NXTP Ventures, Starlight Ventures – which Kargieman advises – and Santiago Pinto Escalier of Endeavor. As stated earlier in this article, NXTP is a funder of GREEN+ member Rootstock as well as the tokenization firm created by Rootstock’s co-founder, Koibanx. Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns a significant stake in Elon Musk’s Tesla, invested in Satellogic’s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/satellogic-series-a--ffe85943">Series A</a> as did Endeavor Catalyst, which is run by LinkedIn/PayPal’s Reid Hoffman, and Valor Capital.

V,” with J.P. Morgan serving as the “exclusive financial advisor to Satellogic,” with a “concurrent PIPE offering of $100 million led by SoftBank’s SBLA Advisers Corp” alongside Cantor Fitzgerald and “other top-tier institutional investors,” including former US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin's Liberty Strategic Capital. Mnuchin’s recently created venture capital firm, along with Softbank, are <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cybereason/company_financials/investors">major investors</a> in Cybereason, a controversial company tied to Israeli intelligence that <a href="https://unlimitedhangout.com/cybereason/">previously simulated</a> the hacking of US critical infrastructure in order to cancel a US presidential election and spur the declaration of martial law. Mnuchin’s firm also includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/20/us/politics/mnuchin-saudi-private-equity.html">Trump’s ambassador to Israel</a>, David Friedman, and previously <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-head-could-join-mnuchin-fund-possibly-violating-waiting-period-report/">attempted to recruit</a> former Mossad director Yossi Cohen, who instead went on to join Softbank.

Morgan’s debt markets in Argentina, before becoming its head of Latin America Emerging Markets and later head of Global Emerging Market Sales.</p><p>The <a href="https://satellogic.com/news/press-releases/satellogic-a-leader-in-satellite-earth-imagery-to-go-public-through-merger-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-v/">press release</a> about Satellogic’s SPAC paints a clear picture of the hefty value proposition behind the public offering, which boasts that Satellogic is the “proven leader in Earth Observation” with “17 commercial satellites” currently in orbit, more than “the next four Earth Observation companies combined.” The satellite company's vertical product stack offers “enhanced analytics capabilities” with “commercial, sustainability, and government applications” by providing a “live catalog” daily of “every square meter of Earth,” providing “vital information to power the conversation around global challenges” such as “climate change, water and energy use, and food supply.”  </p><p>In the SPAC press release, Cantor’s Howard Lutnick stated that “Satellogic is uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry. Its technology, data, and analytics have vast use cases across countless industries.” Kargieman echoed these remarks: “We think this is a winner takes most or winner takes all market. This is a supply limited market – governments just can’t get enough data today; there’s not enough satellites out there.”  </p><p>This is also true for the private sector. Satellogic showed CNBC a then-current investor deck which exemplified the true economic potential of dominating “the Earth Observation industry.” Kargieman noted that the company had completed “a pilot program” with “a major oil and gas corporation,” in which the company required surveillance data for “about 1,800 miles of pipeline every other week.” Doing this visual audit with airplanes “cost about $750 per mile,” whereas Satellogic “demonstrated similar detection capabilities” for less than $60 per mile. While Satellogic failed to clear $0 of revenue in 2020, the company was expecting to see that “tick up” due to new contracts that began generating revenue in the spring of 2021. According to an investor slide deck, the company had a backlog of about $38 million in signed contracts around when they went public, but was predicting “$800 million in opportunities over the next two years.”</p><p>In their <a href="https://stockhouse.com/news/press-releases/2023/04/27/satellogic-reports-full-year-2022-financial-results-and-provides-business-update">full year 2022 financial results update</a>, Satellogic CEO Kargieman tallied “34 satellites in orbit” making “the largest commercial fleet of sub-meter resolution satellites” and thus “well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Earth Observation data and satellites.” Kargieman claimed their revenue grew “42% year-over-year” due in large part to their “Asset Monitoring” and “Constellation-as-a-Service” businesses. Satellogic's new Space Systems, or satellite sales business, “creates a satellite purchase program that aims to lower the financial barrier to Earth Observation spacecraft ownership” according to CFO Rick Dunn. “Space Systems is designed to offer governments asset ownership to enhance national geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) with global tasking autonomy... Going forward, revenue will be driven by our continued growth in Asset Monitoring.”</p><p>Luciano Giesso, Sales Director for Satellogic has stated that Latin America is “an area of focus for us.” He explained a current trend of Latin America being “increasingly focused on space technologies” in order to “create new infrastructures” that “unlock the benefits of satellite data” throughout multiple industries. The press release states Satellogic's position is informed by their view that “countries unequipped with their own satellites” are thus “limited in their ability” to meaningfully “capture data about their policy implementation and infrastructure.” Satellogic’s Dedicated Satellite Constellation Program is specifically marketed as a product for “strategic national interests” allowing “governments of all sizes” to create “unique earth-observation programs” to “support key decisions and manage policy impact, measure investment and socio-economic progress, and foster collaboration, data and information sharing, and innovation.”</p><p>The stated mission of Satellogic is to privatize and monopolize Earth Observation in the form of satellite surveillance sold as a service to both the public and private sectors.

                    <p>“The holistic capabilities of Palantir’s Foundry will be instrumental in helping Satellogic realize our mission to improve life on Earth through geospatial data,” commented Matthew Tirman, President of Satellogic North America. Tirman later made note that within this agreement, Satellogic will provide “Palantir’s US government customers” with access to “high-resolution satellite imagery” which will “drive analytical insights across a range of mission-oriented use cases.” Other notable private-public sector partnerships of Satellogic include the <a href="https://www.mapeos.endeavor.org.ar/skyloom">Endeavor-funded</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230915295300/en/Skyloom-and-Satellogic-Sign-Agreement-for-Multipath-Optical-Comms-Data-Transmission">SkyLoom</a>, which in late 2021 <a href="https://spacenews.com/honeywell-and-skyloom-to-produce-laser-crosslinks-for-military-and-commercial-satellites/">partnered with Honeywell</a> to “produce laser crosslinks” for both commercial and military satellites, including for the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency, as well as with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-details-about-the-cias-deal-with-amazon/374632/">CIA contractor</a> <a href="https://spacenews.com/earth-observation-company-satellogic-expands-partnership-with-amazon-web-services/">Amazon Web Services</a>, to facilitate the “50 gigabytes of data per day” per satellite, which “beams to Earth with the help of the Amazon.com Inc. unit’s AWS Ground Station service.”</p><p>While it is surely a profitable venture, what Satellogic truly enables is venture capital access to high resolution data of every single square meter on Earth. Space surveillance as a service allows the operators themselves to fill up on up-to-date information of the world's industry, energy use, transportation, commodity storage, and asset consumption – information that could influence a firm's decision while playing in the private markets. It could also be used by the public-private partnership engineering global technocratic policies that seek to limit consumption, industrialization and energy use by the public and enforce them via space.</p><p>Outside of this metric-driven advantage, the aforementioned transition to a universal ledger upholding and settling the majority of financial (including purely speculative) activity will require obscene amounts of data. If the private sector's so-called commodity-backed, Real World Asset tokens are to take off in any meaningful way, highly reliable satellite imagery will be needed to uphold billions of dollars of value. Any push towards smart contract-derived money representing tangible objects will demand exactly the data Satellogic intends to not only supply but sell as a service – to any firm, or government.  </p><h2>Blockchain - The New Enabling Environment</h2><p>The idea of green finance, in which private firms utilize data and physical elements from the real world to create novel economic instruments such as bonds based on carbon emissions, necessitates government-upheld agreements and eventual court-based litigation as the ability to find consensus, thus acting as the enabling environment, for the settlement of large values of securities between the public and private sector. Regulation and contractual agreements between governments and their commercial sector partners require not just the literal letter of the law, but vetted insurance brokers, data firms, legislative bureaucrats, and various other accredited lawyers to dictate the grounds in which business can be legally conducted. The private-public partnership has become continually blurred by the relaxing of regulation restricting how corporations can influence current and aspiring politicians via campaign fundraising. In turn, this group of purchased public sector employees must repay the corporations responsible for their successful attempts at gaining office, leading to the push for further dissolution of certain laws that prevented their donors from gaining footholds within a once-regulated market. No longer is the public sector primarily beholden to their constituents, but rather their corporate donors.  </p><p>This ongoing dynamic has led to a runaway feedback of legal corruption and conspiracy between these ostensibly delineated sectors. The net result of the public-private partnerships that upholds the CC35, Green+ and Satellogic collaborations is due to the calculated focus on regional governments, thus finding their enabling environment through pacts and treaties at the subnational level.  </p><figure>

                    <p>Once larger regulatory “fish are fried,” the fight for further interoperability of digital assets (such as dollar instruments) moves down to the regional governments of the Global South. For example, <a href="https://occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2020/nr-occ-2020-125.html">the regulation</a> allowing US banks to custody digital assets and stablecoins was put forth by former OneWest official and Coinbase VP Brian Brooks while he served as comptroller of the currency under Mnuchin in the Trump administration. Once world governments, local and national, are forced onboard the universal ledger, the enabling environment will trend towards the ledger itself – a product of the private sector – and further out of the hands of the public sector.</p><p>This capturing of the commons by the private sector via a revolving door of public-then-private operators has been done before, such as during the Plaza Accord, the creation of Brady Bonds, the dissolution of Glass-Steagall, the demolition of Enron, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 fiscal response. The intended future of blockchain – now that US regulators have embraced Bitcoin as an asset and universal ledger – is to serve as the new enabling environment, complete with its very own digital dollar instruments, most likely backed by US government debt.  </p><p>There are very few people in the world more responsible for the digitization of the dollar than Steve Mnuchin and Howie Lutnick – the former's VC firm now consists of <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/mnuchin-private-equity-firm-loads-up-on-former-treasury-lawyers">several members</a> from his stint at the Treasury, while the latter's firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds the securities for Tether, the world's largest dollar-denominated stablecoin that recently crossed $100 billion issued – and here they are partnering with the richest man in Argentina and the founder of the largest online marketplace (as well as crypto marketplace) in Latin America, Marcos Galperin.  </p><p>The network of firms associated with Galperin's MercadoLibre – Xapo, Paxos, Circle, Visa, among others – is rife with board members and venture capital from the “PayPal Mafia,” as well as the Argentine advisor group Endeavor. These powerful organizations, successors to groups like ADELA that spurred the creation of the Club of Rome and chose the winners of Latin America’s corporate landscape, have made it clear that they foresee this fundamental market transition. They have quietly positioned themselves to dominate the main pillars of the new financial system in Latin America and the world at large: regulated banking services, global marketplaces, payment processing, digital asset infrastructure, and capital creation monopolies. As we will see, this financial system is not about “inclusion” or “sustainability” as professed, but about using and deepening Latin America’s debt burden to force policy changes while enforcing foreign control over the region’s economic activity and governance, all under the watchful “eyes” of US intelligence-linked satellites.</p><p><em>To Be Continued.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg4NDI4NzMxNjA2MjIx/debt_from_above_uhxbm_article_preview.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg4NDI4NzMxNjA2MjIx/debt_from_above_uhxbm_article_preview.jpg"><media:title>debt_from_above_uhxbm_article_preview</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDkwNzkwNDI2NzQ4MTA5/screen-shot-2024-04-03-at-112626-pm.png"><media:title>screen-shot-2024-04-03-at-112626-pm</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[GREEN+]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDkwNzY2NTM1OTkyNTI1/satellogic_green-3630029239.jpg"><media:title>satellogic_green-3630029239</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Satellogic and GREEN+]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg5ODA2MDczOTMwOTU3/screen-shot-2024-04-03-at-102454-pm.png"><media:title>screen-shot-2024-04-03-at-102454-pm</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[From GREEN+]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg5OTEzMTc5Njc3OTAx/screen-shot-2024-04-03-at-103039-pm.png"><media:title>screen-shot-2024-04-03-at-103039-pm</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[From GREEN+]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg5OTQ2NzM0MTA5OTAx/photo_2024-04-03-223456.jpg"><media:title>photo_2024-04-03-223456</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Sebastián Navarro of CC35]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg5OTY5MjgyNjg4MjA1/photo_2024-04-03-223601.jpg"><media:title>photo_2024-04-03-223601</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Craig Cogut of Pegasus Capital]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDkwMTg1MTA0Nzk1MTc0/photo_2024-04-03-224918.jpg"><media:title>photo_2024-04-03-224918</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Aurelio Peccei at the 3rd Annual WWF Congress in 1973]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDkwMDAyMzAwNDQ2MjQ2/smart-grid.jpg"><media:title>smart-grid</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Helena Donoso, Samuel Garcia, Felipe Cano, Santiago F.

<p>In recent years, Franklin Templeton has emerged as one of the earliest big institutional adopters of Bitcoin. After filing for a spot BTC ETF last year, the firm launched its Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) in January amid a wave of SEC approvals.</p><p>This openness to Bitcoin continued in a recent report from Franklin Templeton's Digital Assets division in which it highlighted the rise of Bitcoin-based NFTs called Ordinals, new fungible tokens, and layer 2 protocols.</p><p>Franklin Templeton <a href="https://x.com/FTI_DA/status/1775552645689749905?s=20">tweeted</a> that these new projects primarily drive positive momentum in Bitcoin innovation.

                    <p>With Bitcoin’s next halving set to take place this month, miners are using record profits to adapt their business models for chaotic opportunities.</p><p>The halving is almost upon us. As the whole world of Bitcoin waits with bated breath for mining rewards to be cut in half, the potential for new revenue streams has left us wondering how the space will react to new market conditions. Halvings in the past have generally been associated with prosperity for Bitcoin, but they’ve also been known to shake up previously-held assumptions in a big way. We’re already seeing a few examples of these market changes; just to name one, the larger miners have been modernizing their equipment to ensure maximally efficient hardware. This has led to a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3256562/bitcoin-halving-april-cut-mining-reward-driving-exodus-old-us-equipment-countries-cheap-electricity">fire sale</a> of outdated equipment from these companies, with many thousands of mining rigs finding their way to aspiring miners in Africa and Latin America. The cheap hydroelectricity from <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/chinese-partnership-to-bring-large">Ethiopia</a> has already been attracting international capital to become a new mining hub, and a large portion of these rigs are going there for pennies on the dollar.</p><p>In other words, miners are expecting to see less output in the immediate future, but this has nevertheless incentivized the creation of new mining companies worldwide and net growth for the industry. This is just one illustration of the sorts of unexpected opportunities that will take the digital asset space by storm, and it’s up to Bitcoiners to seize on them. For miners as a whole, opportunities are certainly plentiful. March 2024 saw the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march">highest</a> ever monthly revenues for the collective mining industry, just topping $2 billion. This is particularly noteworthy because less than half of this revenue has come from transaction fees, a far cry from the <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/bitcoin-fees-spike-during-ordinals">situation</a> in December where transaction fees outpaced mining rewards. </p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>In December, the price of Bitcoin was far lower, and the blockchain was plagued with congestion. Not only did this congestion suppress the demand for buying Bitcoin, but it also raised the demand for miners to process the blockchain. Simply resolving transactions on already-mined Bitcoin made up a larger share of profits than mining and selling new ones, and this enterprise became a lifeline for many smaller firms. Now, however, it seems like the money is flowing all around. Bitcoin ETFs are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-etf-demand-surges-outpacing-supply-by-600">gobbling</a> up Bitcoin at extreme rates—more than 6x the actual output of miners. The bonanza has even brought venture capital interest <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/285334/bitcoins-rally-caused-vcs-to-aggressively-return-to-crypto">squarely</a> back into focus, further increasing the frenzy. In the first three months of 2024, major exchanges <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchanges-btc-balances-dropped-10b-2024">collectively</a> saw their reserves of Bitcoin drop by nearly $10 billion, revealing the immense demand for newly-mined coins. With market conditions like this, it’s no wonder that miner profits have hit an all-time record.</p><figure>

                    <p>However, although this period of intense sales has certainly created an opportunity for the miners, there are also perils associated with the halving. These companies are in a mad dash to secure as much revenue as possible pre-halving, and the race is so desperate for one simple reason: trendlines may give encouraging data, but there’s no actual guarantee that Bitcoin’s price will climb accordingly after its supply is cut down. Halving hype and the runaway success of ETFs have brought Bitcoin’s price to its highest levels, but this record has been followed by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/01/bitcoin-becomes-more-volatile-than-ether-as-halving-approaches/">volatility</a>. Bitcoin has hovered around its great benchmark ever since passing it without continuing to rally in a bombastic spike. If Bitcoin’s price continues to behave in unexpected ways, it will eventually wreak havoc on smaller firms and promote industry consolidation.</p><p>Additionally, a particularly interesting development has emerged in the secondary Bitcoin markets. Since the rapacious demand of ETF issuers and other financial institutions has completely outpaced supply, some long-term holders (LTHs) have been <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/massive-bitcoin-consolidation-sell-liquidity-concerns">awakening</a> to fears of a generalized liquidity crisis. Whales previously content to hold Bitcoin for years at a time have changed their behavior, evidently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/highest-monthly-close-ever-5-things-bitcoin-this-week">deciding</a> that now is the time to finally realize massive profits. March 2024 has seen long-term holders begin selling their assets at unprecedented rates, raking in a disproportionate amount of profit in relation to other Bitcoin sellers. Obviously, a resource like this cannot last forever, but it’s an important reminder to some of the miners: just because you’re having trouble making ends meet post-halving, it doesn’t mean the industry is. Adapt, or the space will find new ways to leave you behind.</p><figure>

                    <p>Nevertheless, miners big and small have not taken on the challenge of the halving lying down. These runaway profits have enabled businesses to invest in a wide variety of preparation strategies, sometimes even dramatically shaking up their business models. For example, the American firm Arkon Energy has previously operated more as an infrastructure company, viewing itself as a provider for a client base of independent miners. As it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/arkon-energy-orders-27700-new-generation-bitcoin-mining-machines-from-bitmain">announced</a> a major purchase of state-of-the-art mining equipment on April 2nd, it joined an industry-wide trend of preparing for the halving with maximally efficient machines. Rather than offering this equipment to its previous clientele, however, Arkon has stated its intention to pivot and simply mine Bitcoin themselves. This simple shift represents a dramatic change in their overall business model, and they plan to follow through by “aiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world”.</p><p>Leading miner Hut 8, on the other hand, has initiated a business model <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/hut-8-diversification-around-bitcoin-halving">pivot</a> of its own, but in a slightly different direction. A Q1 earnings call in late March saw CEO Asher Genoot acknowledge that 70% of the company’s revenue came from asset mining, but that plans were expected to change somewhat as the halving approaches. Hut 8 is still focusing on upgrading its hardware and exploiting energy resources at new sites, like many other mining companies, but it’s also investing in a new direction. This new direction is not in a different asset, as its mining operations are focused on Bitcoin, but rather in developing high-performance computing and AI operations. Genoot claimed that these new operations were “sub-scale today… But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow." He added that “You’ll see us continuing to be creative in how we maximize the value of every machine,” stressing the need to maintain an eager and disciplined attitude toward the existing mining operations. </p><p>These are just a couple of the different new strategies that miners are taking to anticipate the halving. Companies have been preparing for months now, and there is still time to make additional new plans. At the time of writing, the halving is in less than three weeks, and the <a href="https://www.bitcoinhalving.com/">countdown</a> to this event reveals the optimistic and celebratory attitude of Bitcoiners everywhere. No matter what happens when the long-awaited day finally gets here, a few constants seem very reliable. There will be an immense demand for the world’s leading digital asset, and the Bitcoin community will have the same innovative spirit as always. Whether Bitcoin jumps right away or behaves unpredictably, it’s certain that someone will wind up a big winner. For us Bitcoiners, that means there’s plenty to look forward to.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDc5ODcyODg4MzE3OTA4/default_bitcoin_miners_2.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDc5ODcyODg4MzE3OTA4/default_bitcoin_miners_2.jpg"><media:title>default_bitcoin_miners_2</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDc5NzAwNTUyNzU0Njg2/d0b13dfc-707a-47ab-abd2-01ee140c5f68_1600x900.jpg"><media:title>d0b13dfc-707a-47ab-abd2-01ee140c5f68_1600x900</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchanges-btc-balances-dropped-10b-2024">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDc5NzIzNjM4MjA0Mzcy/aa6eea49-8f62-4c06-9095-e8d423407d75_1600x900.jpg"><media:title>aa6eea49-8f62-4c06-9095-e8d423407d75_1600x900</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/highest-monthly-close-ever-5-things-bitcoin-this-week">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Largest US Crypto Exchange Coinbase To Integrate The Bitcoin Lightning Network]]></title><description><![CDATA[Coinbase is finally integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, promising near-instant and cheap transactions.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/largest-us-crypto-exchange-coinbase-to-integrate-the-bitcoin-lightning-network</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/largest-us-crypto-exchange-coinbase-to-integrate-the-bitcoin-lightning-network</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightspark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Coinbase]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 15:21:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDc5NDY4MDg3NjUwMjYw/gkpq9biaoaaz9gj.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">Lightspark</a>, led by CEO David Marcus, former President of PayPal, has been <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/news/coinbase-selects-lightspark?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=coinbase">selected</a> by Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network onto its platform.

<p>According to Bloomberg ETF analyst <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1775147839498207695?s=20">Eric Balchunas</a>, March trading volume was around triple that of February and January. The massive rise indicates spot bitcoin ETFs are meeting strong demand from institutional and retail investors. </p><p>He stated, "I can't imagine April will be bigger, but who knows."</p><p>BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack, capturing 50% of the total volume. Grayscale's GBTC took second place with 20%, while Fidelity's FBTC followed at 17%.</p><p>Balchunas declared IBIT the "$GLD of bitcoin," referring to the mammoth SPDR Gold ETF. He said its March victory makes IBIT the undisputed leader among bitcoin ETFs.</p><p>The surge in trading activity aligns with Bitcoin's climb to new all-time highs in March. However, it also suggests spot ETFs are altering market dynamics and driving new demand.</p><p>Critics initially argued bitcoin markets would shrug off the new products.

In the process, they’re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies.</p><p><em>A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below.</em></p><p><strong>Frank Corva:</strong> What is the primary mission of NoOnes?</p><p><strong>Ray Youssef:</strong> It's the world's first peer-to-peer distributed nation. I see myself as a chief advocate, not just CEO — someone that is representing the people. We want to onboard a billion citizens in the next six years.</p><p>By citizens, I mean engaged customers. They're not just using it once every two weeks. They have to be deeply engaged for this to be victorious. That means a billion daily engaged people. It's an amazing number when you consider Binance has 120 million users and about 2-3% of them are probably monthly active. We're trying to get a hundred times that.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> How many people are currently using it?</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> We have about 400,000 active users, which is pretty amazing. My old company had like a quarter million active [users]. The goal here is not just to get empty signups. The goal here is to make people active.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> You’ve talked about how apps like NoOnes and Bitcoin can help end “financial apartheid.” Could you define this term?</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> Financial apartheid is the most evil form of apartheid. It's invisible chains that have basically kept the vast majority of the world poor for over a hundred years, and people aren't even aware [of it]. It manifests in so many different ways.</p><p>Broken overregulation [is one form of it]. Africa is the most overregulated region of the world. M-Pesa is the top mobile wallet in Kenya. 98.8% of Kenyans have an M-Pesa wallet. M-Pesa is so big it’s expanded beyond Kenya to Ghana, South African and other African countries, but you still can't send money from an M-Pesa wallet in Kenya to an M-Pesa wallet in Ghana or South Africa.</p><p>You are trapped in the economy where your passport was issued. You can't access liquidity in other countries, and they can't access liquidity in your country.</p><p>The problem gets even worse when you consider commerce between companies. Pan-European trade is at 69%. In Asia, I think it’s 59%. Latin America drops down to 30%. And Africa, officially it's at 13%.</p><p>But guess what? The real number is less than 1%. Because in that 13%, they count all these American and Western corporations that just have local names. Intracontinental African trade is at less than 1%. If that doesn't scream financial apartheid, what does?</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Speaking of Africa, let's discuss what's happening in Nigeria. The government took two Binance executives hostage. In response, Binance has stopped supporting the Naira and has shut down its P2P trading platform in Nigeria. NoOnes is currently enabling Binance P2P traders to transfer their P2P trading profiles from Binance to NoOnes. How is this going?</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> Traders are very happy to have their feedback imported over. It's very important. Reputation is huge in this business, especially if you're an OTC trader. [So,] we made a special landing page for all the peer-to-peer refugees.</p><p>They're very happy to come over and be able to talk to the CEO directly in a Telegram and WhatsApp channel. That goes a long way.</p><p>Binance is being torn apart by the US government right now. Why did they go for this guy (Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance’s former CEO) so hard? Were they angry he was front-running his own users? No. They didn't care about that at all.</p><p>What they really cared about is that CZ and Binance allowed all of us plebs — all of us peasants out there — to have financial access through peer-to-peer trading. The fact that there's 120 million people on the same internal money transmission network and that CZ has all these off ramps to local money all over the world set them off.</p><p>Remember the guy they came after before CZ? Ross.</p><p><strong>Corva: </strong>Ross Ulbricht?</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> Yes, sir. Peer-to-peer is the enemy, and it always has been. They've had Ross in jail for over 11 years. He just put up a website like Amazon or eBay where anyone could trade anyone with anything.</p><p>[Sure,] some people sold some weed on there. For that, they made up this story about [his involvement in a murder conspiracy]. This is all garbage. This is a sweet, innocent kid. And they put him in jail for two life sentences.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> And Sam Bankman-Fried only got 25 years.</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> The only reason Sam Bankman-Fried got any time at all was because some rich people lost some money. This is the only reason that Madoff got any time at all. too. If he was robbing poor people, no one would give a damn. But Ross Ulbricht, man, they hit him with everything because they could. They wanted to send a message: “Hey, if you try to make global free marketplaces — real commerce — happen, we're going to destroy you. You don’t touch that.”</p><p>And guess what? They’ve done that to bitcoin, [too]. They said, “Hey, we’ll let bitcoin exist as a store of value. If you get in good with us, we’re going to give you an ETF ticker. We’re going to get our pension funds in there. We’re going to let the price go up high. You’ll be just a little bit better off than everyone else. But you gotta give up this whole medium of exchange [thing].”</p><p>We gave up literally the best thing in the world, a free system of real commerce for a store of value for just another get rich quick pump and dump. It’s actually beginning to dawn on all of us: Oh, my goodness. Roger Ver was right.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I was actually just watching an interview with him on The Bitcoin Takeover. He made some interesting points that are in line with what you’re saying.</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> I mean, yeah, I was pissing all over Roger with all the other clowns before, too, but the dude is right. We have lost the ethos. We have lost the foundational base for what we're doing. And should they actually manage to keep bitcoin out of the picture as this medium of exchange and just keep it as a store of value, eventually we'll lose everything.</p><p>If it wasn't for what's happening in the Global South, it's empty. And quite frankly, the Global South has moved over mostly to USDT on Tron. The only nation still [using] bitcoin primarily for a medium exchange is Nigeria. But the truth is, USDT on Tron is way cheaper. It doesn't have volatility. It makes a lot more sense. So, how are we going to compete with that?</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> That’s a good question. Going back to Nigeria for a moment. NoOnes has team members on the ground who are promoting the platform in the wake of Binance P2P shutting down. Do you ever worry about their safety? How do you deal with the fact that they could easily be targeted?</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> Number one, I’d try to get them out of the country. And if we can't do that, then I’d ask them to keep as low of a profile as possible. We also keep something in the bank to represent them legally. I don't want anyone to go to jail for anything I do. I'm not going to play with other people's freedom or safety.</p><p>But throughout this whole process, everyone's been pooping all over the Nigerian government. They're like, “These people are dumb,” and that's not helpful. There are some very smart people in the Nigerian government that know exactly what's going on, but they can't tell their own people exactly what's going on because their own people wouldn't be able to handle it or help them.</p><p>Every time I talk about this on Bloomberg or CNN Africa, I say, “The governments are not the problem. There is external pressure being applied to them that we're not aware of.” And this is always the case in every one of these situations, whether it's Zimbabwe or Venezuela.</p><p>I invite the government to talk anytime. Peer-to-peer is not a problem but the solution to actually correcting Nigeria's capital control imbalance. If you go to peer-to-peer traders and say, “We need you to help us get more American dollars into the government here to stabilize the price of the Naira, they're like, 'Okay, [let’s] do it for Nigeria.'”</p><p>[However,] they're not going to lose money doing it. They want to make some money doing it. But if they have the choice between doing the right thing to help everyone across a long-term timeline and making a little bit less profit, they'll take that. Believe me, these people are not stupid. They know what's good for the country is good for them, and that should be leveraged.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Speaking of people not being stupid, the team at NoOnes focuses heavily on education. How challenging is educating people on the ground?</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> I posted a video on my Twitter of one of our workshops. There were over a thousand people there. That's how much hunger there is for this.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seriously, Education is THE way and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/noOnes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#noOnes</a> is absolutely blowing up now !<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> to the first billion, self custody and p2p. <a href="https://t.co/lEGaNlXGSE">pic.twitter.com/lEGaNlXGSE</a></p>&mdash; Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1772953829434105917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Everyone needs bullish education. What I mean by bullish education is not the one, two, threes, or even how the blockchain works. No one really cares. It's how to make money. People want to change their lives.</p><p>You can move money around the world to leverage arbitrage. You can start real simple and put up an offer to buy bitcoin cheap on NoOnes and then take it and sell it on another exchange, a local exchange, whether you're in South Africa or Malawi or wherever at 10% plus. That's what some people are doing.</p><p>One guy I just talked to last week was making $2,000 a month — just buying bitcoin cheaply and selling it for 9-10% of what he bought it for. He [told me], “This is how I’m paying my way through college.” He spends just five hours a week doing these trades.</p><p>There's another dude in South Africa, and he identified a problem. Nigerian workers want to send money back home to mama. They can't do it because they don't have a South African bank account. So he tells them, “Deposit your cash into my South African bank account.” He just takes that cash, buys bitcoin with it, sells that Bitcoin to someone in Nigeria on the NoOnes marketplace and says, “Send a bank transfer to this guy’s mother’s bank account.” </p><p>He did two peer-to-peer transactions and turned [South African] Rand into a Nigerian bank transfer, and the people on the ground are super happy they didn't have to do it themselves. They just put money in the bank, gave him his mom's bank account number. He did all the work. He's banking and making profit. He started his own remittance corridor. He's basically Western Union for the very specific corridor of South Africa to Nigeria.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> These are incredible stories. When I think about NoOnes, I think about people around the world gaining access to bitcoin, not necessarily becoming entrepreneurs using the platform. It’s great to hear that P2P bitcoin trading enables this.</p><p><strong>Youssef:</strong> Absolutely. We are in the middle right now of the peer-to-peer revolution. It started with the internet. We got all these mobile devices and all these startups that disrupted everything except finance. Then, we got peer-to-peer electronic cash. Now, we're fighting for the soul of it as a [medium] of exchange.</p><p>Peer-to-peer marketplaces are the last step. That's what they put Ross Ulbricht in jail for. That's what they put CZ in cuffs for. They don't want someone actually finishing it, completing the peer-to-peer revolution.</p><p>We're going to the mom and pops, the farmers markets, but if the money isn't peer-to-peer, none of it will stick. Once we’ve gone peer-to-peer, what power do they have?</p><p>Humanity is officially one once we tie that ribbon around the peer-to-peer revolution.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDU3MjU5MzQ4NjMzMDg2/noones_youssef_article_preview.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDU3MjU5MzQ4NjMzMDg2/noones_youssef_article_preview.jpg"><media:title>noones_youssef_article_preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tether Grants BTCPay Server $100,000 To Continue Working On Enabling Anyone To Accept Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tether said this donation further underscores the company’s support for the FOSS movement.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-grants-btcpay-server-100000-to-continue-working-on-enabling-anyone-to-accept-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-grants-btcpay-server-100000-to-continue-working-on-enabling-anyone-to-accept-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tether]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[btcpay server]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 15:53:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDU3MDYyODUzODc5NzY0/btc_payserver_banner.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, stablecoin issuer Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-awards-100000-grant-to-btcpay-server-foundation-backing-free-and-open-source-software-development/">announced</a> a significant award of $100,000 to the <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay Server Foundation</a> that underscores Tether's strong backing for the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement, emphasizing its commitment to advancing digital payment solutions, the company stated.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: Tether donates $100,000 to BTCPay Server so it can continue working on enabling anyone to accept <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> 💥</p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1775172587326189867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

One of the longest running criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not possible to make arbitrary programs to control how money is spent or locked. Bitcoin only has a very limited amount of programmability in its scripting language, and the primitives available are extremely constrained. You can check a signature, you can add a timelock to something, you can manipulate data in a few simple ways, but that’s it. </p><p>You can program a Bitcoin UTXO to require a signature check, a timelock verification, etc. But you cannot program it to unlock based on any arbitrary conditions. Robin’s insight with BitVM was that one single primitive in the field of computing <em>could</em> be enforced in Bitcoin script: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate">NAND gate</a>, one of the basic primitives of computing at the physical/electrical level. Every computation that is possible can be constructed out of NAND gates. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NTc3Njg3MDQyMDA0/mjaxmzc5otqxmtmwotcxmta5-2.jpg" height="800" width="560">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Script can actually verify a NAND gate due to a neat trick using OP_BOOLAND and OP_NOT. OP_BOOLAND is an AND operation, the opposite of NAND. OP_NOT takes a binary 1 or 0 value and inverts it. This together allows you to actually enforce a single NAND operation in script directly. In combination with hashlocks, a NAND gate script can be made where each input and output field has two possible hashlocks to “unlock” that spending path, each one pushing a 1 or 0 to the stack to perform the NAND operation. Each script also has a path where if you can reveal <em>both</em> preimages to a single bit value, you can immediately claim the funds. This is so that once someone decides what to input to the NAND gate, they cannot change their mind without losing money. </p><p>A massive amount of NAND gate scripts can all be compacted into a taproot tree, and once someone commits to the bit values off-chain to input to that computation, the other party can challenge them on any individual step in the computation to prove it is being executed correctly on chain. Each “challenge” allows the challenged party to prove that the individual gate was computed correctly, otherwise the other party can claim the funds after a timelock. Going back and forth like this if a computation is contested, it is guaranteed that the cheating party will eventually be caught and lose funds. </p><h2>The limitations</h2><p>The main limitation of BitVM is that only the people involved in creating a BitVM contract can participate, and the roles are very limited. There is the prover, the person asserting how the computation happened off-chain, and the verifier, the person who can challenge the computation and force it to be proven on-chain if the prover does not complete the computation off-chain or tries to lie about the results. </p><p>One of the reasons for designing BitVM was to establish two way pegs to sidechains or other systems. The scheme offers a very powerful primitive in that use case, the ability to actually enforce funds be given to one party or the other based on the correctness of an arbitrary computation, i.e. a validity check on whether a pegout is valid according to a sidechains rules. The problem is, only the people who hold keys to that BitVM UTXO can actually go “Hey, you’re cheating!” when someone is, and engage in the challenge protocol. This ultimately makes the system still trusted. </p><p>Another limitation is that the challenge response protocol can be very long. If someone realizes the outcome of the computation is going to result in them losing money and they stop responding, the verifier has to essentially guess where the individual NAND gate is in the computation that the prover would have to lie at and reveal both preimages to a bit that would give the verifier the funds. Until that specific gate is challenged on-chain, the prover can still respond correctly to a challenge and drag it out. This can be very time consuming and inefficient. </p><p>Some improvements to this design have been made since the original proposal to allow for multiple verifiers to exist in the system with the prover, to create a 1-of-n trust model where only a single verifier is required to challenge a dishonest prover. However, this requires the instantiation of multiple BitVM instances in parallel to accomplish, and therefore increases the inefficiencies with the original two party design.</p><h2>BitVM 2</h2><figure>

                    <p>Robin recently proposed a design scheme for <a href="https://www.bitvm.org/bitvm2">BitVM 2</a>. This scheme seeks to make a few trade offs in comparison to the original design for the benefit of mitigating its two major shortcomings. BitVM 2 shortens the challenge/response protocol length from an indeterminate series of transactions that could be upwards of dozens in the worst case scenario, to two rounds in the challenge/response. In addition to this, with the use of connector outputs it allows <em>anyone</em> to act as a verifier. It does not require someone to be a member involved in establishing the BitVM to challenge a dishonest prover. </p><p>The fundamental shift here is moving away from directly using script NAND gates to implement the raw computational trace directly, and moving to using them to implement a general SNARK zero knowledge proof verifier (one of the core primitives Robin intended from the start to implement using BitVM). Instead of putting the raw input into the raw computational trace, and running it gate by gate in their own tapleaf scripts, the input of the BitVM 2 instance would simply be a zero knowledge proof input in combination with an asserted output of the computation. </p><p>In addition to abstracting away the computation implementation with a ZKP, the tapleaf scripts are being massively expanded from a single NAND gate per leaf to an entire sub-function of the ZKP verifier. Instead of the challenge response protocol being based around the verifier guessing at which NAND gate the prover attempted to cheat at, selectively challenging at a single gate, the verifier can prove an entire sub-function’s output is invalid according to the input. </p><p>Just like BitVM 1, the contract is pre-negotiated using pre-signed transactions and branching scripts. Funds pegged into the BitVM are sent to an n-of-n multisig which signs two possible execution transactions, one in which no challenge occurs, and one in which a challenge occurs. To start the process of executing the contract, the prover initiates a kick off transaction. This kick off transaction commits to the output value ‘y’ they claim the computation produces, and includes three outputs: a timelocked output that is included in the no challenge execution transaction, a connector output A, and a connector output B, both of which also are spent in the no challenge transaction. </p><p>Here is where the design allows for anyone to participate as a verifier. Connector output A has a second pre-signed transaction that can spend it, the challenge transaction. This is a pre-signed transaction that pays the prover a bond in bitcoin, but the connector output A is not enough to fund it. Literally anyone can add their own inputs to fund the transaction and spend connector output A, which invalidates the no challenge withdrawal transaction for the prover (one of the inputs it needs no challenge exists). </p><p>This forces the challenge path. Connector output B is also spendable using a pre-signed transaction, the assert transaction, to the output of every sub-function in the entire BitVM 2 contract. This requires a large transaction with a lot of data, but remember, the ultimate output ‘y’ the prover is claiming the computation produced was already committed to in the kick off transaction. This creates two outputs. One is a timelocked output, the other is a connector output C. Both of these outputs, in addition to the original pegged in funds, are all spent in the second successful withdrawal transaction for the prover after the timelock. </p><p>Connector output C is also spendable by anyone who can prove that any sub-function output in the BitVM 2 contract produces an invalid output. This requires a very large transaction, because the script necessary to prove an entire section of the BitVM computation is incorrect is massive, but in this single transaction a verifier can claim the coins in the connector output with a valid proof. This invalidates the second withdrawal transaction for the prover and effectively burns the coins. The only way to recover them at this point is if the prover and <em>all</em> of the verifiers in the original n-of-n funding multisig all cooperate to recover them (in the case of a setup ceremony involving key deletion this recovery possibility does not exist). Connector output B in the kick off transaction can also be spent after a much longer timeout than no challenge withdrawal to invalidate both the no challenge and the assert transaction, burning the pegged coins. </p><p>This reduces what could be a ridiculous chain of transactions in the original BitVM proposal to enforce the correct contract outcome, to at most four transactions (although admittedly very massive ones), while in the process making the set of verifiers for the BitVM 2 instance literally anyone with bitcoin who will fund the challenge transaction. </p><p>BitVM 2 could wind up being a significant breakthrough in regards to the wave of rollups and other layer 2s aiming to use BitVM as a two way peg. The operator of a rollup (the prover in the BitVM) can use their own funds to cover withdrawals of users who have pegged into the system, and periodically withdraw those funds from the BitVM to compensate themselves. <em>Any</em> user or interested party would then be able to penalize them by burning their funds if they could produce proof the operator was not processing all withdrawals correctly. </p><p>It is important to note that ultimately the security of a BitVM 2 instance is backstopped by the n-of-n keyholder, even though people not participating in it can still challenge the prover as a verifier. But because the prover has an efficient exit in the case of no challengers, and anyone can fund the challenge transaction to act as a verifier, the n-of-n funding multisig could follow a setup and key deletion ceremony similar to the Zcash launch to improve its security. </p><p>BitVM 2 will probably wind up being a significant breakthrough in terms of improving the flexibility and trust model of two way pegs that make use of BitVM. Once again, Robin has proven himself a real wizard. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NjA0Nzk5MDIyNTkw/default_a_close_up_view_of_the_glowing_lines_of_electricity_su_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NjA0Nzk5MDIyNTkw/default_a_close_up_view_of_the_glowing_lines_of_electricity_su_0.jpg"><media:title>default_a_close_up_view_of_the_glowing_lines_of_electricity_su_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NTc3Njg3MDQyMDA0/mjaxmzc5otqxmtmwotcxmta5-2.jpg"><media:title>mjaxmzc5otqxmtmwotcxmta5-2</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDQ3NTg0MTI5NDkyOTQ4/permissionless_bridge_v2-1.png"><media:title>permissionless_bridge_v2-1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arkon Energy Orders 27,700 New-Generation Bitcoin Mining Machines from Bitmain]]></title><description><![CDATA[The parties are set to finalize definitive agreements regarding this purchase order "in the coming days," the companies stated.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/arkon-energy-orders-27700-new-generation-bitcoin-mining-machines-from-bitmain</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/arkon-energy-orders-27700-new-generation-bitcoin-mining-machines-from-bitmain</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arkon Energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitmain]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDM1MDE5NDcxMTAzOTU2/default_a_gold_bitcoin_on_a_mining_machine_0-1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC, a leading player in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, has placed a significant order with Bitmain Development Pte.

<p>Of the $2 billion earned last month, around $85 million came from transaction fees, while $1.93 billion was from the block subsidy. (Miners receive compensation both for validating transactions and minting new bitcoins.)</p><p>The block subsidy, paid out for each block mined, is currently 6.25 bitcoins. But it will drop to 3.125 bitcoins after the upcoming halving event in April. This will cut miner revenue from new bitcoin creation in half unless there is a significant price rise.</p><p>Higher network activity and increasing bitcoin prices both contributed to miners' bumper revenues in March. The upcoming halving created urgency for miners to maximize earnings before profits are squeezed.</p><p>The leading US mining pool, Foundry, captured 29.4% of all blocks mined in March. Chinese pool AntPool took second place with 22.4% of blocks. The two captured over half the monthly Bitcoin supply.</p><p>While miners enjoyed their profit bonanza last month, exchange-traded funds purchasing bitcoins on the open market accumulated even more.

The resulting difficulty increases may start pricing out less efficient miners, spurring industry consolidation.</p><p>With the halving cutting rewards in half in a matter of weeks, miners face an increasingly harsh environment if Bitcoin's price fails to compensate for the drop in issuance. But if history repeats, a strong bitcoin bull run could still be on the horizon, softening the revenue blow of reduced block subsidies.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5NTIzMTk3NTA5NDQ1MjQ4/what-is-bitcoin-mining.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5NTIzMTk3NTA5NDQ1MjQ4/what-is-bitcoin-mining.png"><media:title>what-is-bitcoin-mining</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tether Adds 8,888 BTC Worth $600 Million to Bitcoin Treasury, On-Chain Data Shows]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-8888-btc-600-million-bitcoin-treasury-on-chain-data</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-8888-btc-600-million-bitcoin-treasury-on-chain-data</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 10:32:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5ODE5NDg2NjMzNjY1NjM5/tether-7172951_1280.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stablecoin issuer <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/tether">Tether</a> has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million.

Despite facing scrutiny from regulators before the announcement, many people still asked how the biggest exchange in crypto could just disappear from the world’s fastest growing market for Bitcoin adoption. I wasn’t shocked because I’ve been predicting this for years. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are under attack and the frontline is a currency war being played out right before our eyes. </p><p>I founded NoOnes, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform based in the Global South, because I foresaw the problems facing the crypto industry. Three years ago, I saw this day coming. I knew it was coming because I was the CEO of a Bitcoin company based in the United States, and I saw the financial apartheid and all the regulatory problems up close. American regulators hold Africans in such low regard they make rules to suit Westerners and don’t care too much about anyone else. I knew it would be more and more difficult to serve Africans and the rest of the Global South if my company was based in the US. That’s why I created NoOnes. </p><p>My only option was to turn my back on a business I had built into a Bitcoin P2P platform with over 10 million users. The problems I saw back then are exploding right now, but blaming governments alone is not the path forward. We must understand the pressures our leaders are under because only when we do that can we come to the table with them to forge a new path ahead. Right now, all we have is a bunch of people cursing each other and that is not the way forward. </p><p>This war is about the financial system and the power to control the levers that decide whose money is good and whose money is bad. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are trapped in their own markets, so that even making payments or doing business with countries next door is difficult. For the average African entrepreneur to scale any business by expanding outside the African continent, it is basically impossible. And now that Binance has left Nigeria, some businesses based here are wondering what’s next. </p><p>To be able to truly unlock the potential for Global South entrepreneurs to create value, we have to nurture them and create an environment that allows them to flourish. That’s only possible if we do what I’ve been advocating for years: ensure there is free trade by having a free-flowing money system. Making it happen is not going to be easy, and that’s why I had to make some tough decisions. I had to leave the US, I had to give up a successful company I founded, and I had to start all over again in the Global South. </p><p>I know why Binance was forced to leave Nigeria, and I’m sure it will happen to other crypto companies and in other countries. It’s almost impossible to run a crypto business or a bitcoin marketplace serving Africa from another continent because you have to be on the ground to see the problems and find the solutions. I knew we couldn’t achieve our mission to help the unbanked if we didn’t have boots on the ground in the Global South, and that’s why we based NoOnes here right from the start. I’m not some mad guy who gave eight years of my life to a company and then left on a whim. I set-up NoOnes so I could be here for this</p><p>moment. Binance might have pulled-up stakes and gone home, but NoOnes won’t do that – we are already home. </p><p>I know Nigeria and I know the Global South because my businesses have been active here for years. We live and work here now, and we listen to what people on the ground tell us. We hired local Africans to handle moderation for Africans, for example, and that’s partly what “boots on the ground” means – instead of a bunch of Americans passing judgment, we use local Africans to make moderation safer and fairer. We are not looking at Africa – or any of the Global South where we operate – as places to plunder. We see Africans as partners and fellow humans. That’s why we created our partner program to share our profits with the people who are part of our business. </p><p>I’ve met thousands of tech-savvy Nigerian entrepreneurs and I know there is a reason for the high-level of Bitcoin adoption here. For too long they have been shackled by an unfair global financial system, by financial apartheid that creates money prisons and stifles economic growth. Bitcoin and NoOnes give those entrepreneurs the opportunity to show what they can do when markets are free and money is allowed to flow. All they need to grow is a level playing field. They just need a shot, a path towards success, and when we open up any window of opportunity they bust right through it. That’s why NoOnes is not simply creating the best site to buy Bitcoin. We are going all out to give them life-changing opportunities. </p><p>When I speak in auditoriums around Africa and explain what is possible with Bitcoin and our peer-to-peer platform, I see people’s eyes light up. When I talk to them one-on-one, I am astonished at the amount of hustle and business acumen they have. Our next step is to make it easier for these entrepreneurs to take their business to the next level. We are building a product that will give local entrepreneurs a massive opportunity to build businesses in their own country for their own citizens, and, ultimately, to keep the profits inside their country. </p><p>Despite the withdrawal of Binance Nigeria, tons of opportunities remain. NoOnes was built for these times and we are ready to pick-up the slack to help dynamic, savvy Nigerians who see the value of Bitcoin and want to be a part of this new era of prosperity in the Global South. The battles we have to fight might be tough, but the opportunities on the fastest growing continent on the planet are worth it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ray Youssef.
