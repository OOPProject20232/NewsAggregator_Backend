                    <p>This collaboration between Square and Cash App empowers eligible Square sellers in the U.S. to allocate between 1-10% of their daily sales from their Square seller account to be automatically transferred to their personal Cash App account. The funds will then be used to purchase bitcoin at the end of each day, and sellers will have full control over their bitcoin holdings, including the ability to hold, send, sell, and manage their BTC as they see fit. A transparent, flat 1% fee applies to each conversion made from daily sales to Bitcoin.</p><p>Block stated that it believes that Bitcoin is a tool for economic empowerment, enabling global participation in a digital monetary system.

The collaboration builds on previous integrations between Square and Cash App, offering additional value and efficiencies for participants across Block's ecosystem.</p><p>Bitcoin Conversions is available to eligible sole proprietors or single member LLCs in the U.S., with a gradual rollout planned for all eligible sellers in the coming months (excluding New York State-based sellers).</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ0Mjg1MDE3Njc5MzE0/magnific-x5tmtfakoogjbzt7fzbm-mtc5mjk3nzywodqznja1njk5__1_.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ0Mjg1MDE3Njc5MzE0/magnific-x5tmtfakoogjbzt7fzbm-mtc5mjk3nzywodqznja1njk5__1_.jpg"><media:title>magnific-x5tmtfakoogjbzt7fzbm-mtc5mjk3nzywodqznja1njk5__1_</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQzNTU2NDgzODUxNTQy/board.png"><media:title>board</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unchained Is Helping Users Secure 90,000 BTC And Counting in Self Custody]]></title><description><![CDATA[Joe Kelly, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin financial services platform Unchained, is determined to give users a true Bitcoin experience, while still meeting them where they’re at.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-is-helping-users-secure-90000-btc-and-counting-in-self-custody</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-is-helping-users-secure-90000-btc-and-counting-in-self-custody</guid><category><![CDATA[Unchained capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unchained]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cold storage]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin ira]]></category><category><![CDATA[Multisig]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Frank Corva]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 13:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ2NzY5NjU2MjU5ODYy/unchained_joe-kelly_article_preview.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Company Name:</strong> Unchained</p><p><strong>Founders:</strong> Joe Kelly and Dhruv Bansal</p><p><strong>Date Founded:</strong> October 2016</p><p><strong>Location of Headquarters:</strong> Austin, TX</p><p><strong>Amount of Bitcoin in Treasury:</strong> Not disclosed</p><p><strong>Number of Employees:</strong> 107</p><p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://unchained.com/">https://unchained.com/</a></p><p><strong>Public or Private?</strong> Private</p><p>Joe Kelly and Dhruv Bansal started <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained</a> with one main objective: to provide financial services to people like themselves — long-term bitcoin holders. Since 2017, when Unchained launched its first product, a lending desk that allowed customers to borrow US dollars against their bitcoin, the company has developed into a full-on financial services company for Bitcoiners who value holding their private keys.</p><p>Unchained now offers a suite of services and products, including multsig vaults for both individuals and businesses, a bitcoin trading desk, a bitcoin IRA and inheritance planning for bitcoin. Where Unchained really shines, though, is not just in how it helps clients safely secure their bitcoin, but in how it guides them through the process of doing so. It has a <a href="https://unchained.com/concierge">Concierge Onboarding</a> team that walks clients through the often vulnerable process of setting up a multisig vault.</p><p>“We really like being a navigator,” Kelly told Bitcoin Magazine. “We’re not authoritative, like ‘You should do that.’ We’re the guide. We’re here to help show you ‘Here’s a map. Here’s a couple of trails you could take up the mountain. Pick your way, and if you need somebody to be your sherpa up one of these trails, we’ll do that for you.’”</p><p>I sat down with Kelly to learn more about the philosophy that underpins Unchained’s approach, the company’s history and how it’s established itself as one of the most trusted financial service providers in the Bitcoin space.</p><p><em>A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below.</em></p><p><strong>Frank Corva:</strong> How did you and your co-founder Dhruv Bansal meet?</p><p><strong>Joe Kelly:</strong> Craigslist. I was an undergraduate college dropout looking for my next opportunities, and Dhruv was in grad school. His department, the physics department, was looking for a new website. They posted the gig like, “Hey, come build a website.” I was like, “Maybe I want to start a web development firm.” So, I came in to meet him at the center for nonlinear dynamics, which is chaos theory. I told Dhruv I'd always been hyper curious about this field of study. That's been an enduring part of our relationship, our shared curiosity about complexity science. We started building the company after that.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> So, you’re an autodidact. Are you the type that will seek out mentors or do you just read everything you can find on a topic until you understand it thoroughly?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> It's a mix. Like a lot of humans, I can just go with intuition versus deriving knowledge from a book. I wish I’d had more mentors. Over the last decade plus, I’ve been thrown into the deep end of being a CEO. I've had to learn a lot on the job.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> What have been some of the hurdles that you’ve surmounted with Unchained since you founded it in 2016?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> One of the things that excited me most with Unchained early was that it felt like a very contrarian bet in a couple ways. Back in 2016, all the VC funding was about “We're not sure about this Bitcoin thing, but blockchain is the real technology.”</p><p>But Dhruv and I looked at people like us that held bitcoin for the long term and felt that we were the customer we wanted to serve: the long-term bitcoin holder had sort of no financial services advocate for them, no trusted institution that worked with them in a healthy way.</p><p>Then it was feedback like, “Well, what about these other coins? Or why don't you lend out the bitcoin like BlockFi is doing and increase your revenues?” Saying no to those things was also contrarian. Principally, we said, “No, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is it. Bitcoin is enough.” The idea of lending out bitcoin was popular, but I’m really grateful we didn't do that. Otherwise, we would have risked our fate like everyone else.</p><p>We were willing to be unpopular, stand alone and be underfunded compared to competitors for a lot of our early history. That changed, thankfully, with partnerships like NYDIG, who led our series A in 2021. That put us more on the map of having money, having resources and looking like we knew all along that we were going to be right.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> So, is the long-term bitcoin holder the typical Unchained user?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Yeah, that core sweet spot is that the individual long-term bitcoin holder who gravitates to self-custody because they're already doing it or wants to work with somebody that helps them feel comfortable doing it.</p><p>Now, some of our core sweet spots are those people's businesses or their trusts. Unchained is one of the few places that enables you to onboard a trust while you can still hold your keys. It's not like you give them up to some third-party custodian to get those benefits.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Which products are currently your most popular?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Unchained Vault is the bread and butter product that most every client uses. 95% of all clients have a vault that's either a personal or business account.</p><p>More than a third of our clients have IRAs with us now. That's been one of our faster growing product lines over the last year or two.</p><p>Loans are taken by some percentage of clients, but not everyone.</p><p>Trading really couples well with a vault. Increasingly, a bigger portion of the client base uses our trading desk, as well.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>Corva:</strong> When I think of Unchained’s approach, the two words that come to mind are “security” and “service.” You have a concierge service to help onboard clients and I’ve heard you talk about how important security is when it comes to storing the bitcoin that clients lend to you. Did you know that security and service would be at the center of what you do since the beginning?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Security was there at the foundation early on. And I was on the front lines answering customer inquiries in our first year or two. We had a culture of really taking care of clients as much as possible when our main product was lending.</p><p>As we launched the vault product in 2019, part of what unlocked that product for us was the Concierge Onboarding product, which brings clients through the process of initializing the hardware wallets and getting set up with the multisig vault. That interaction is led by someone on our team, which is a big trust building opportunity.</p><p>While someone is making a backup of their private key in a live session — off camera, of course — going through those really vulnerable, private steps of initializing [their multsig vault], they've got an Unchained representative on the other side coaching them through it, answering any questions and making them feel comfortable. So, yeah, I think you nailed it when you said that security and service come together at Unchained.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Do you find it harder to convince people to use Unchained now that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are live and more convenient investment vehicles?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> The ETF does a great job in growing overall awareness for Bitcoin, creating more legitimacy around the asset for those that might have been on the fence. We haven't seen it cloud or affect our client onboarding funnel. That still runs at a full pace like it was pre-ETF and has even been accelerated since the ETFs launched earlier this year.</p><p>One of the most effective elements of our sales approach is the army of Bitcoiners out there that don't work at Unchained but encourage everyone to practice self custody. People sometimes come to us because they feel the peer pressure of “Hey, you know, I've been going to Bitcoin meetups, and I know I need to get my base for self custody.”</p><p>Also, over the last two years, the median age of our clients has gone up. More members of the Boomer generation have been holding bitcoin. Maybe they're two or three years into the space after buying in 2020-21 and like “Alright, now I'm ready to do this. I've been through the trough and some of the peak and I'm going to hold this for a decade or more. Let me finally get self custody figured out.”</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> It sounds like you’re quite in touch with what customers want. I’ve also read that you pay close attention to customer feedback and factor it into your approach at Unchained. Can you give an example of a product you’ve created based on customer feedback?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> One example is last year in Q4 we launched Sound Advisory, which is our Registered Investment Advisor affiliate. The thinking behind that came out of customers that would come in for a Concierge Onboarding and talk to one of our frontline people. One of the last questions they would ask was, “Do you know anybody that can give me financial advice for my bitcoin? I can't talk to my traditional financial advisor, but I'm nearing retirement age and I'm thinking about when I might want to sell some bitcoin or whether I want to get a loan against my bitcoin.”</p><p>People want to think through those decisions practically. The awful reality for a lot of people is you can't talk to your financial advisor, you've got to hide this part of your portfolio. They're not going to be philosophically aligned with you. It’s really difficult when you don’t have that alignment with somebody who should be such a trusted advisor.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I know that feeling. What else have you learned from your customers over the years?</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Something we've seen at Unchained, having been around for eight years now, is how Bitcoin adoption happens in the wake of macro geopolitical events or things that wake people up like, “Hey, it's not actually my money at the bank.”</p><p>Also, people learn from things like the Canadian trucker protest where they saw that you can lose access to your dollars if you believe in certain things.</p><p>Then we had the failures of SVB and First Republic last year.</p><p>What we've created at Unchained is really kind of an antifragile set of products and services that aligns with core tenets and the core philosophy of Bitcoin. That means that when a lot of those bad things happen, we see influxes of clients.</p><p>I'm immensely proud of what the team has done here in terms of helping thousands of people get into a really comfortable position with assets outside of the traditional financial system and outside of systems that [are prone to] centralized risks of seizure or control over their bitcoin.</p><p>Unchained has over 7,000 clients that secure over 90,000 bitcoin with 12,000 keys. In four years, maybe that’s 100,000 keys securing tens of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin.</p><p>I think that'll be a really unique financial institution that couldn't have existed before. And our goal is to do that profitably in a way where we're around as long as possible but also that's going to be a net good for society, the industry and ecosystem overall.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I give you an immense amount of credit for not underestimating the user. What you're doing with Unchained is saying, “We're going to give you the full Bitcoin experience.” At the same time, you’re a financial services company and can play the TradFi game. It’s great for people who are more familiar with traditional finance, but who want to understand bitcoin and what makes it different from traditional assets or investments.</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> It's a model and an attitude that's in contrast to the classic Wall Street attitude, which looks for “How do I get your money over here so I can make more money?” There's obviously a version of that's not always just in the client's interest.</p><p>We’re the [opposite]. We’re trying to do business transparently — literally transparently on the blockchain — and as a company.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> It’s apparent that you're playing a long game, because your clients are going to have this experience with Unchained that’s different from the experience they have with traditional financial institutions, and they’re going to tell their friends about Unchained.</p><p><strong>Kelly:</strong> It goes back to your ETF question. You may buy some shares in the ETF as your first exposure to bitcoin, but you're only partially converted at that point. The full conversion happens when you've taken your sacrament of sending bitcoin with a hardware wallet. That’s a key part of the journey.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ2NzY5NjU2MjU5ODYy/unchained_joe-kelly_article_preview.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ2NzY5NjU2MjU5ODYy/unchained_joe-kelly_article_preview.jpg"><media:title>unchained_joe-kelly_article_preview</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5NTU4NzUwNzA5MTg5/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---100-off-code.png"><media:title>bm-x-unchained-article-cta---100-off-code</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em>Click the image to get $100 off Unchained IRA.</em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs to Trade on 30th April: HashKey Capital]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hong Kong is set to make history as the first spot Bitcoin ETFs are slated to begin trading on 30th April.

You may have also seen discussion around several acronyms beginning with “P2,” such as P2PKH or P2WSH. If you’re unfamiliar with what these acronyms mean, here we’ll look through all the standardized on-chain methods for receiving bitcoin throughout its history and explain some essential differences that make each method unique.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJyWHPQYMrE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>P2PK</h2><p>Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) is the original method of receiving bitcoin, and it does not involve an address. Instead, as the name suggests, bitcoin is paid directly to an exposed public key. The first ever bitcoin transaction from one person to another used P2PK, when Satoshi Nakamoto sent coins to Hal Finney in Block 170.</p><p>P2PK is no longer used because it is a more expensive, less private, and less secure way of receiving bitcoin than subsequent methods.</p><h4>Quick facts</h4><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjExMTg1NzIy/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10014pm.png" height="262" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>P2PKH</h2><p>Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) was available for use at bitcoin’s beginning, and it showed up on the blockchain for the first time less than two weeks after the genesis block. P2PKH makes several improvements upon P2PK, such as utilizing an address. As discussed <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-address/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">in our earlier article</a>, addresses contain a checksum that helps prevent typos and lost bitcoin.</p><p>P2PKH addresses are typically 34 or 33 characters in length (but could theoretically be <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/36948/140404/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">as short as 26 characters</a>), and they are encoded in <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Base58 format</a>. They begin with a prefix of <strong>1</strong> and are currently responsible for receiving and securing 43% of the mined bitcoin supply, more than any other address type.</p><figure>

                    <p>Creating a P2PKH address involves putting a single public key through hash functions SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. This shortens the amount of data, which in turn helps save block space and transaction fees for the user. It also introduces further resistance to reverse-engineering the private key beyond the already believed-to-be-unbreakable secp256k1 elliptic curve.</p><h4>Quick facts</h4><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjExMTIwMTg2/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10025pm.png" height="256" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>P2MS</h2><p>Pay-to-Multisig (P2MS) is a trivial transaction type that was only briefly relevant and has never been responsible for holding more than 100 bitcoin at one time across all network participants. Nevertheless, P2MS is a part of bitcoin’s history.</p><p>P2MS was introduced as a standard script in early 2012, as specified by BIP 11. However, this transaction type suffered from the same problems as P2PK since it included exposed public keys and did not use any address format. It also limited the number of public keys in a multisig quorum to three. Within months P2MS would be replaced by an alternative method for receiving bitcoin into a multisig arrangement called P2SH, which we will cover next.</p><h4>Quick facts</h4><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjExMDU0NjUw/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10033pm.png" height="259" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>P2SH</h2><p>Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) was introduced to bitcoin as a soft fork in accordance with BIP 16 on April 1, 2012. Like most forks, the story behind it is fascinating. P2SH shares a lot in common with P2PKH. The main difference is that the address is created by hashing a redeem script instead of hashing a single public key. </p><p>A redeem script can be thought of as coded instructions specifying how bitcoin received to the P2SH address can be spent in the future. There could be a wide range of possibilities, including multiple different public keys. The receiver, not the sender, determines the script details, and the spending instructions are not exposed publicly until bitcoin is spent out of the address.</p><p>While advanced users can construct complex scripts, the most common uses for P2SH have been to create Nested SegWit addresses (covered below) and multisig wallets. For example, a script can include three public keys and specify that signatures from any two of the corresponding private keys can spend the bitcoin. This would create a 2-of-3 multisig address.</p><figure>

                    <p>P2SH addresses are exactly 34 characters in length, and they begin with a prefix of 3, as specified by BIP 13. Before the soft fork on April 1st, a handful of transactions experimented with this alternative prefix, the first of which is found in Block 170,052.</p><h3>Quick facts</h3><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjEwOTg5MTE0/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10043pm.png" height="260" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>P2WPKH</h2><p>Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) is the first of two address types introduced to bitcoin upon the SegWit soft fork in August 2017. The story behind this extremely important and particularly contentious soft fork is documented in a book called <a href="https://a.co/d/hUKyXwZ">The Blocksize War</a>, written by Jonathan Bier.</p><p>P2WPKH is the SegWit variant of P2PKH, which at a basic level, means that choosing this address type rather than older P2PKH addresses will help you save money on transaction fees when moving your bitcoin around.</p><p>SegWit addresses look quite different from the older address types because, per BIP 173, they use Bech32 encoding instead of Base58. Most notably, there are no capital letters in Bech32. P2WPKH addresses can be identified by a prefix of bc1q and a character length of exactly 42.</p><h4>Quick facts</h4><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjEwOTIzNTc4/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10058pm.png" height="257" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>P2WSH</h2><p>Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) is the SegWit variant of P2SH. The main advantage to using P2WSH over P2SH is that it can help lower transaction fees, and the primary reason to use a script hash instead of a public key hash is to accommodate multisig arrangements.</p><p>Like P2WPKH, a P2WSH address begins with a prefix of bc1q. However, it has a longer character length of exactly 62. Unlike the address types covered thus far, P2WSH addresses are created using the SHA-256 hashing function alone, without including RIPEMD-160, resulting in the increased character length. This was implemented cautiously, adding extra protection from a fairly nuanced and extremely unlikely multisig attack vector.</p><h4>Quick facts</h4><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjEwOTIzNTc4/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10058pm.png" height="257" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>Nested SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH)</h2><p>Nested SegWit (also known as Wrapped SegWit) is technically not a different address type than we’ve covered above. Still, it is a unique way to use previously discussed address types in a manner that was temporarily useful for the bitcoin community.</p><p>When the SegWit soft-fork occurred, not all bitcoin nodes, software, and services immediately upgraded to support the new Native SegWit address types, P2WPKH and P2WSH. Only the entities that did upgrade could send to these new addresses. This meant that folks who wanted the ability to receive bitcoin from anybody (including those who hadn’t upgraded) couldn’t use a Native SegWit wallet yet. However, since SegWit offered cheaper transaction fees, most people were keen to begin using it.</p><p>The crafty solution to this dilemma was to utilize the P2SH transaction type. The entities that had not yet implemented SegWit could still send bitcoin to P2SH addresses—which, as discussed above, are built with a redeem script specifying the instructions on how the bitcoin can be spent later on. As it turns out, these instructions could incorporate the new SegWit spending model, providing users with a bridge to reduced fees. Therefore, the P2SH addresses using this trick became known as Nested SegWit, and they played a significant role in the SegWit adoption process.</p><p>On the surface, Nested SegWit addresses are indistinguishable from other P2SH addresses, so the supply of bitcoin held in this arrangement is unknowable. Additionally, since all modern bitcoin tools can now send directly to Native SegWit addresses, there is no longer any good reason to use Nested SegWit.</p><h2>Quick facts</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4NDcyNjEwODU4NDky/screenshot-2024-04-23-at-10115pm.png" height="260" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>P2TR</h2><p>Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) is the newest address type, made available by the Taproot soft-fork in November 2021. P2TR adoption remains quite low at the time of writing, and many bitcoin softwares and services are still working on integration.</p><p>While P2WPKH and P2WSH are known as SegWit V0, P2TR is considered SegWit V1. Notably, P2TR utilizes a digital signature algorithm called Schnorr, which differs from the ECDSA format used in earlier bitcoin transaction types. Schnorr signatures have several advantages, including additional transaction fee reductions and increased privacy.</p><p>Regarding privacy, the key and signature aggregations made possible by Schnorr allow multisig addresses to be indistinguishable from singlesig, and the full spending conditions for a P2TR address are not necessarily revealed publicly. The creator of the address can even include multiple customized redeem scripts to choose from in order to spend the bitcoin later.</p><p>P2TR addresses are 62 characters long, and they use Bech32m encoding, a slightly modified version of Bech32, as described in BIP 350. P2TR addresses can be identified by their unique bc1p prefix.</p><h4>Quick facts</h4><figure>

It's often claimed that the Bitcoin network offers levels of decentralization, accessibility, and distribution unmatched by any other cryptocurrency. But just how decentralized is Bitcoin in reality? And how do we go about measuring its decentralization? Before delving into these questions, it's crucial to clarify the concepts of centralization and decentralization, as they are often muddled.</p><p>To provide a clear definition, the centralization/decentralization dynamic can be understood as the degree of concentration/diffusion of authority among the participants in a system. Here, "authority" refers to the power to influence the functioning and rules of the system, whether for malicious or benign purposes. With this in mind, measuring the degree of centralization in a system involves quantifying the minimum number of entities, participants, required to alter its functioning or rules. The lower this number, the greater the degree of centralization. In a seminal 2017 paper on the subject, Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland Lee introduced an insightful metric for this purpose: the Nakamoto coefficient.</p><p>Derived from the Lorenz curve used in calculating the Gini coefficient, the Nakamoto coefficient identifies the minimum number of participants necessary to compromise or control the system. For instance, in the well-known scenario of Bitcoin's hashrate, if we assume that five mining pools collectively possess 50%+1 of the total hashrate, then this number would be five. This means that a simple majority of 50% of the hashrate would be adequate to execute a double spending operation on the blockchain. However, the critical threshold may vary for other variables.</p><h2>Different facets of centralization</h2><p>Now, let's address the core issue identified by the authors of the paper: identifying subsystems critical to the functioning of the system. When it comes to Bitcoin, focusing solely on the concentration of hashrate (i.e., miners) fails to capture the full spectrum of centralization/decentralization within the network and overlooks the potential for a 50%+1 attack.</p><p>Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland Lee, in their article, propose five additional measurable subsystems of the Bitcoin Network: client platform, code developers, nodes, custodial/exchanges, and ownership.</p><p>According to Balaji S. Srinivasan, the six dimensions of centralization within the Bitcoin network are as follows:</p><p>• Client centralization</p><p>• Ownership centralization</p><p>• Node centralization</p><p>• Developers centralization</p><p>• Custodial/exchanges centralization</p><p>• Hashrate centralization</p><p>In addition, we might consider adding one last dimension:</p><ul><li>Hardware Centralization</li></ul><p>While this list is comprehensive, what's lacking is a qualitative assessment of these dimensions. Which among them are truly pivotal for Bitcoin's network functionality, and which are not?</p><p>For instance, one could argue that the client or ownership variables aren't as crucial in measuring Bitcoin's decentralization.</p><p>In the first case, Bitcoin Core stands as the de facto standard client today. However, it's worth noting that this is an open-source software authored by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. As long as it remains open-source, actively maintained, and monitored, its dominance doesn't necessarily equate to vulnerability. It's important to recognize the distinction between Bitcoin Core's hegemony rather than a monopoly, as theoretically, other operational clients exist—such as Bitcoin Knots, BTCD, Libbitcoin, BitcoinJ, Bitcoin Unlimited, Gocoin—that can support the Bitcoin protocol. Yet, in practice, very few network nodes utilize these alternatives, favoring Nakamoto's original implementation. In this regard, in 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto himself said: "I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea." <em>Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 2</em></p><p>As for the second dimension listed above - the distribution of Bitcoin ownership - this undoubtedly has significant socio-economic implications but it doesn't directly affect Bitcoin's infrastructure. Since Bitcoin relies on a proof-of-work algorithm, the power that Bitcoin owners have over nodes and protocol operation is essentially nil. The centralization of sat ownership could only become problematic if currency concentration reaches such extreme levels that undermine the network effect, impacting practical use as a medium of exchange and store of value. Fortunately, as polarized as Bitcoin wealth may be, we are far from this point and according to various analyses, as Bitcoin adoption increases, the concentration of sats gradually decreases. <em>Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 3</em></p><p>Conversely, subsystems like nodes and coding are pivotal for achieving true network decentralization, being potentially the most critical points within the Bitcoin system. The risk of node takeover and subsequent hard forks or coordinated malicious actions on the protocol poses significant and lasting threats to network trust. However, the probability of such occurrences is already low and have constantly decreased over time, given the growing number of active or quickly activatable nodes (approximately 16 thousand and 53 thousand respectively, according to the latest known data) and their distribution across different locations, entities, and legal jurisdictions. <em>Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 5</em></p><p>In the latter case, the concentration of Bitcoin Core code developers - the so-called Core developers and maintainers - remains very high and arguably increasing from a certain perspective: there are relatively few programmers actively involved in writing and maintaining the client despite it being a critical function for the entire technological infrastructure of the Bitcoin network. As of today, on average, between 40 and 60 developers contribute to this task each month with commits according to GitHub data. They decide voluntarily and independently when and how to contribute to the development of Bitcoin Core software on GitHub. In practice, over the years, there has been a rather high turnover within this community of developers: it includes both historical developers dating back to the early versions of Bitcoin Core and many newcomers who have joined more recently. Many historical figures have left over the years, while others have re-aggregated later, some operate consistently and regularly, others in a limited and sporadic manner. Within this group, which does not have a formalized hierarchy (and how could it, being Bitcoin an open-source project?), there are even fewer key developers, those who pull the strings of the community's work. According to GitHub data, from its beginnings, 30% of the known commits to the Bitcoin Core master repository were made by only 2 developers, and in particular, almost 25% (meaning 7347 out of a total of 29,822 detected commits) by Wladimir van der Laan alone, the former Bitcoin's Lead Maintainer. After his departure in 2022, there has not been a single coordinator of work on the Bitcoin Core code, but his enormous contribution remains undisputed. As of today, guiding the work on Bitcoin Core development is a restrictive leadership made up of a few senior developers including Gennady Stepanov, Michael Ford, Ava Chow, and Gloria Zhao, each specializing in overseeing a specific component of the client."</p><p>One might wonder if such a small and decentralized group of developers/maintainers contributing to the code today might be the Achilles' heel among Bitcoin's various subsystems, making the entire structure vulnerable to attack. A huge, complex, and highly valuable (not only economically) infrastructure like today's Bitcoin network relies on the often part-time and mostly unpaid work of a few passionate supporters and maintainers. On the one hand, it's true that individual nodes have the final say on the adoption of each new update/version of the Bitcoin Core client through the consensus mechanism. On the other hand, one might question how many nodes actually analyze the new code for vulnerabilities, harmful changes, or bugs before installing it.</p><p>What would happen if, hypothetically, gradual infiltrations of saboteurs occurred within the limited circle of Key Core developers and Maintainers, with the aim of first gaining trust and influence in the community and then hacking the new versions of the code? They could, for example, hide virtual time bombs within them (in the form of bugs or zero-day vulnerabilities). It's a Machiavellian and complex hypothesis to execute, but not impossible, especially if we consider a gradual, covert operation conducted by entities with significant financial, human, and technological resources at their disposal and with a strong motivation to disrupt the network, such as the intelligence service of a powerful state. What would be the consequences of such an operation on Bitcoin if it were successful? Probably quite serious, if not existential. It could unleash chaos among nodes that unwittingly implemented the corrupted update, leading to forced hard forks with effects on the stability, integrity, and trust in the Bitcoin network. What a technological brute force attack couldn't accomplish, social engineering aimed at dismantling consensus could. It's difficult to estimate the probability of success of such an attack on the Bitcoin Core code, but the small number of individuals overseeing its development and maintenance, and the relative lack of interest from the wider user community in their valuable work (and, last but not least, their remuneration), make this subsystem particularly vulnerable to a well-conceived attack. <em>Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 4</em></p><p>When considering the realm of custodial and exchange services, the trend toward greater or lesser centralization isn't entirely clear-cut. While their numbers have soared since the early days of Bitcoin (think MtGOX), the lion's share of trading volumes against fiat currencies today remains concentrated among a select few major players (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, Kraken, Bitfinex, etc.). Specifically, as of today, three major entities hold more than 55% of the Bitcoin held in custody by third parties, while just Binance rules the volume of fiat-BTC transactions with 30% of total public exchanges. The risks stemming from excessive centralization in this specific subsystem aren't so much tied to the security of the Bitcoin network itself, but rather to its convertibility with fiat currencies and the security of those delegating custody (i.e., all those Bitcoin users entrusting their sats and hence their "physical" possession).</p><p>In the first scenario, heightened centralization (a reduction in the number of exchanges) would render the system more vulnerable to coordinated legal or cyberattacks aimed at disrupting and potentially severing the link between fiat currencies and Bitcoin. This follows the logic that fewer doors make for easier locking. In the second scenario, under an oligopolistic regime, those opting for custodial solutions instead of self-custody would face increased counterparty risk. This would result from the diminished bargaining power of users towards custodial counterparts, who could then impose more burdensome economic conditions and more oppressive clauses (for example, regarding access to custodied bitcoins) than they could in a competitive environment.<br>Moreover, with only a few large operators capable of controlling significant bitcoin quantities on behalf of their clients, the risk of abuses (such as non-consensual fractional reserve practices), hacking (the richer the target, the more appealing), and political-regulatory interference (including collusion with public authorities, excessive regulation, and bureaucratization) would be considerably higher compared to a more fragmented and competitive custodial system.</p><p>At the far end of this counterparty risk spectrum lies the possibility of a 6102 attack: the large-scale seizure of bitcoins held on exchanges and custodial wallets within a certain jurisdiction by legislative action. While this wouldn't directly impact the functioning of the Bitcoin network, it would likely undermine trust in Bitcoin as a secure means of payment and store of value among the general public, thereby jeopardizing its success as a free permissionless currency.<em> Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 3</em></p><p>We won't dwell much on the hashrate/mining subsystem as both the issue of its decentralization and the possibility of 51% attacks have been analyzed and dissected countless times by far more authoritative sources. We only recall here the most common attack scenarios: double spending attack, selective transaction censorship, and empty block attack. The consequences of such attacks could be awful and should not be underestimated, but there is a vast literature explaining the limitations of this type of attack and the countermeasures that could be adopted by the node consensus to thwart it or at least effectively counteract it. However, all in all, it remains one of the most delicate and vulnerable subsystems, if only due to its degree of centralization. In fact, two mining pools – Foundry USA and Antpool – currently control more than 50% of the hash rate.<em> Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 4</em><br><br>Finally, turning to the hardware dimension (originally absent in the work of Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland), we need to analyze the diversification of mining equipment in terms of manufacturers, models, and their respective market shares of Bitcoin's hashrate. It's undeniable that nowadays the number of hardware manufacturers for mining (ASICs) has significantly increased compared to the past. Major companies in the sector include Bitmain, Whatsminer, Canaan, Zhejiang Ebang Communication, Halong Mining, Helium, Bitfury, Bee Computing, and HIVE Blockchain. However, the total hashrate of miners is currently dominated by a few ASIC models and even fewer manufacturers. According to recent estimates by Coinmetrics, over 70% of the global hashrate is produced by ASICs from a single leading company, Bitmain. Additionally, including just three other manufacturers (Whatsminer, Canaan, and Ebang) accounts for virtually all of the computational power used by the Bitcoin network. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of the hashrate is generated by only seven ASIC models from these aforementioned companies: Antminer S19xp, Antminer S19jpro, Antminer S19, Canaan 1246, Antminer S17, MicroBT m20s, and MicroBT m32.</p><p>The risks of such centralization of hardware in terms of models and manufacturers are numerous. With very few large manufacturers, primarily now located in China, they could easily be compelled by governments and lawmakers of the jurisdictions they're subject to, to halt production in their facilities, hand over batches of manufactured hardware, or secretly infiltrate backdoor hardware and trojans into their ASIC models. The consequences would immediately impact the mining subsystem, causing instability and potentially a collapse in the network's hashrate, resulting in significant economic losses for miners using corrupted ASICs or those unable to acquire new ones. A significantly lower and prolonged hashrate would reduce the security of the entire network, as it would increase the chances of a 51% attack, perhaps precisely by the actor who initiated the hardware attack. Here, we see how an attack on one poorly decentralized subsystem can virtually weaken another and thus attack it in a dangerous chain reaction with dangerous consequences for the integrity of the Bitcoin network. <em>Damage qualitative assessment from 1 to 5: 3</em></p><p>Given this non-exhaustive overview of the various subsystems of Bitcoin and their vulnerabilities, we can endeavor to synthesize the six dimensions into a single table. This table would measure the risk of centralization as a matrix between probability (P) and damage incidence (D, i.e.: the relevance of effects on the network), illustrating the dynamics toward increasing or decreasing centralization.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ3MjQwMjIzNjc5OTQy/table2.png" height="800" width="1195">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>A probability score (P) is assigned on a scale from 1 to 5 based on an inverse and non-linear function of the number of entities required to reach a given critical centralization threshold. In other words, the greater the number of existing entities required to reach a certain threshold, the lower the probability score. The aforementioned threshold is a percentage (sometimes subjectively defined) of the total estimated number of entities participating in a given subsystem, beyond which the system becomes seriously vulnerable to compromise. In some cases, this threshold is objective, as in the case of the mining dimension, while in others it is more arbitrary, such as in the case of developers or the client; however, in general, it could be understood as the tipping point of centralization.</p><p>A damage variable (D) is also assigned a score from 1 to 5. This is attributed in relation to the negative consequences expected from an attack on the specific subsystem on the security, stability, and functionality of the Bitcoin network as a whole.</p><p>This latter score is obviously subjective and undoubtedly could be subject to criticism and subsequent revisions by more in-depth analyses.</p><p>Finally, the specific risk score, which summarizes the risk of centralization of each subsystem, is obtained from the product of these two scores.</p><h2>Geographical and Economic Decentralization</h2><p>Other variations of the decentralization/centralization dichotomy can be identified, which cut across the seven types just illustrated: geographical (jurisdictions) and economic (economic entities). Geographical decentralization addresses the question: where are the nodes, wallets, exchanges/custodians, and miners physically and legally located? Economic decentralization, on the other hand, concerns the economic ownership of these entities: for example, who owns the mining pools? Or who controls the exchanges? The geographical and economic aspects may seem overlapping at first glance, but in reality, they are not at all. For instance, there could be a Bitcoin ecosystem where there are many independent miners, but all located within the same jurisdiction and thus subject to the same political-legal risk. Here, economic/ownership centralization would be low, while geographical centralization would be very high. Conversely, there could be many miner factories scattered across the globe but controlled by the same economic entity and therefore effectively considered as a single point of failure. The same argument could equally apply to nodes, hardware or bitcoin ownership. In a world dominated by states and large corporations, neglecting these factors can be fatal. The mere number of participants in a Bitcoin subsystem tells us little about decentralization if they are mostly concentrated in a single jurisdiction or subject to the same economic control. Therefore, both the qualitative geographical parameter and the economic parameter should be integrated into any attempt to measure the degree of decentralization of the Bitcoin network.</p><h2>What changes with ETFs?</h2><p>The recent emergence of Bitcoin ETFs in the US market may have a considerable impact on the decentralization of the network, particularly concerning the Custodial/Exchanges subsystem. While investing in an ETF significantly simplifies access to bitcoin performance compared to other fiduciary solutions, this option doubles (if not triples) the counterparty risks for investors. Those who "invest in bitcoin" through an ETF do not actually possess or own the assets; they are subject to both the counterparty risk of the ETF manager and that of the Custodial/Depository to which the ETF relies on (if the manager does not opt for an unlikely self-custody), as well as the risk of the intermediary/broker through which they acquire the instrument. In practice, the adage "Not your keys, Not your coins" reduces to a simple "Not Your Coins, goodbye" especially in the case of an hypothetical 6102 attack applied on ETFs.</p><p>On a macro level, the same arguments made for custodial/exchange entities apply to passive funds on Bitcoin: the more they are utilized by institutional and retail investors as a form of "investment in bitcoin," the more bitcoin is absorbed into their masses. Consequently, their coercive power over users and contractual (i.e., economic) power over other subsystems of the Bitcoin Network increase. If a specific Bitcoin ETF were to acquire a significant (if not dominant) market share of circulating bitcoin over time and systematically use its proceeds to subsidize developers of the Bitcoin Core client, it could influence their actions, guide client implementations, and thus the development direction of the entire network towards its desires. This would be a case where the centralization of one dimension (that of custodians through ETFs) leads to the centralization of a much more vital dimension: that of developers discussed earlier.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Upon examining various dimensions of decentralization within the Bitcoin network, two critical subsystems come to the forefront due to their significant relevance and current limited decentralization: the mining/hashrate subsystem and the coding/developers subsystem. While discussions around the former have been ongoing since the inception of the Bitcoin project, with debates on numerous 51% attacks and their solutions, the latter has largely been overlooked or underestimated by analysts. Despite the historically honest and transparent behavior of core developers, whose intentions have consistently aimed at the genuine success of the technology, this does not guarantee the same conduct in the future.</p><p>The numerical scarcity of Bitcoin Core developers, coupled with the disproportionate code contributions from a select few individuals compared to the total participants, poses risks of infiltration, hacking, and social manipulation that cannot be downplayed. The insufficient number of developers to ensure an attack-proof level of decentralization might stem from their limited recognition and financial rewards within the Bitcoin user base and the wider global programming community.</p><p>Whereas miners have a financial incentive predetermined by the protocol itself to participate constructively and faithfully in the network, the same cannot be said for client programmers who lack predetermined, impartial, or proportional remuneration for the quantity and quality of their work. Those among them who have not enriched themselves with Bitcoin in the network's early days and/or do not act out of selfless altruism, have to rely on grants, scholarships, and donations from third-party philanthropic entities to sustain themselves. The main subsidies to Bitcoin Core developers currently come from various organizations and companies in the Bitcoin Economy such as OpenSats, Spiral, Square Crypto, Chaincode, MIT DCI, Blockstream, Gemini, Coinbase, BitMEX, Hardcore Fund, etc. Their contribution is crucial, but their generosity is not necessarily neutral or disinterested. It’s not a bad thing in itself, but what would happen if other less benevolent donors, who likely have intentions and interests not aligned with the success of Bitcoin, were to take their place?</p><p>This raises concerns about potential interference from less benign donors, which could compromise the security and stability of the entire Bitcoin network. The limited numbers, ad hoc collaborations, and uncertain economic incentives make the role of core developers unattractive to most programmers, rendering them vulnerable to corruptive or manipulative actions.</p><p>To address these challenges and incentivize the independence, participation, and retention of core developers, we outline a few ideas here.</p><p>At one extreme, we could have dedicated micro-crowdfunding platforms that exclusively provide limited, non-refundable donations from donors to avoid imbalances and undue influences from a few individuals. At the other end, a multilateral agreement - optional but technically binding for signatories - among the big players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (miners, ETFs, exchanges, etc.) in which they commit, verifiably by all, to contribute a predefined share of their earnings to Bitcoin Core developers, thus subjecting themselves to a kind of voluntary self-taxation. </p><p>In both cases, technical implementation of incentive systems could utilize DAOs, smart contracts, and layer-2 solutions to regulate criteria for disbursement and anonymize payment flows to developers. </p><p>Naturally, the two ideas mentioned are not mutually exclusive or conclusive. Even less should they be imposed from above. We consider them simple grassroots ideas to initiate a serious debate on the need to value the key role of Bitcoin programmers without undermining their autonomy. A debate that, in our modest opinion, should be urgently reopened among all those who believe in the value of this revolutionary technology.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Michele Uberti.

Many people all over the world are currently living somewhere presenting serious risks to their livelihood and well being, everything from totalitarian and persecutory governments to the general state of the economy deteriorating so badly that their ability to sustain themselves is in question. </p><p>This puts people in a horrific position, having to choose between continuing to tough out the situation and maintain their possessions, or leaving most of what they own behind to flee from abusive governments or a destroyed economy. If they are lucky enough to even have the financial and practical capability to leave in the first place. You can’t bring large amounts of cash or gold with you, they’ll be seized at the border. Bank account balances can be completely restricted, meaning that even though you can technically access it globally in most cases, it can be locked down in an instant. </p><p>You can’t bring your house, you can’t bring your car unless you can drive where you’re going (if you even own one), you can’t bring any sizable physical asset. All you can take with you is what you can carry on your back or in a few bags. Bitcoin completely changes this dynamic. It is a vehicle that can transport any amount of wealth you have stored in it across any border. </p><p>All that is required is you in one form or another carry twelve words with you across the border. That is all it takes to bring your wealth with you should you find yourself in a situation where things are bad enough you have no option but to flee. These are some of the best options. </p><h2>Border Wallets</h2><p><a href="https://www.borderwallets.com/">Border Wallets</a> is a very interesting scheme taking advantage of how people’s brains work with visual memory. The tools provide a way to generate a two dimensional grid of all the possible seed words. This can be generated in a few different ways, but I would recommend that anyone who uses this tool use the deterministic generation mechanism. This ensures that in a worst case scenario if you lose your copy of the seed word grid, you can regenerate the same one if necessary. </p><p>This grid can then be filled in using a recognizable or memorable pattern. Human beings are very visual animals, and the reality of how our minds work is that visual patterns are much easier for the average person to memorize than words. After generating the grid, users can select words on the grid in a recognizable pattern that is easy to recognize. <em>It is critically important to remember the order you are going to follow for actually turning this into a seed phrase</em>. I.e. are you following all the highlighted words left to right in a row, then moving down each row? Are you going down each column top to bottom, then moving to the right one column? </p><p>Recognizable shapes are great, a circle, a square, even a Bitcoin B. With the ability to regenerate the same grid, an easily recognizable pattern you can fill in, and the order in which to turn those highlighted words into a seed phrase, Border Wallets present a powerful tool designed specifically to ease the mental load of keeping a seed phrase memorized. </p><p>This should allow you to cross an international border without anything identifiable at all that is related to Bitcoin. Just remember, before actually making the trip, <em>test things</em>. Run through the process of creating the word grid, make sure that you can properly regenerate the same grid. Create a test pattern and set it aside, then come back and make sure the pattern you remember arrives at the same word seed. </p><p>Once you’ve run through the testing and verified you can regenerate everything properly, you can make the trip out of the country with confidence that your Bitcoin is safe and will be accessible when you arrive at your destination. </p><h2>Samourai Wallet</h2><p>Samourai Wallet in addition to their coinjoin implementation Whirlpool, and other privacy features, has one particular feature that has existed from almost the beginning of the project in one form or another: Stealth Mode. This is an incredibly valuable feature in a situation where you must cross an international border. </p><p>The mobile application can be set to obscure everything about the fact that it is a Bitcoin wallet. The logo is changed to masquerade as a number of different applications, and all signs of Samourai Wallet being installed are obscured. It can function as either a calculator app, a VPN app, a QR scanner, or a notepad. Each fake application is functional, and when launched has the appearance of being whatever decoy app the user selects. Each decoy app has a different mechanism hidden in it to actually open Samourai Wallet to access your Bitcoin. </p><p>It is important to note that this will not stand up to any forensic analysis of your device. I.e. if it is seized and actually inspected using computer forensics software, they will be able to suss out the fact that a Bitcoin wallet is installed. However, a manual inspection of your device (which is much more common if any inspection takes place at all) should give no sign whatsoever to a customs agent that a Bitcoin wallet is installed on your device. </p><h2>Steganography</h2><p>Steganography is the technique of hiding a piece of data or information inside of some other piece of information. A good example of this is hiding information inside of a jpeg. It is possible using different digital tools to take a secret piece of information, such as a text document, or a bitcoin seed phrase, and embed it inside of a jpeg. The jpeg would look completely normal, with no changes to the visual image, but the file itself would have the secret information included within it to be extracted by anyone who knew it was there. </p><p>Now this requires putting your seed phrase on a computer to encode and embed it, and requires using tools that are not very user friendly (there are web based tools for this kind of thing, but <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em> use something like that to handle your seed phrase or private keys). However, the general concept is something that can be useful. </p><p>Do you have a book? Any book? If you do, see if you can go through it page by page and find the words in a seed phrase you have generated in the correct order through the pages of the book. If you can, you’ve just found something that can be used to transport your seed phrase safely without anyone suspecting it. Simply go through the book and highlight (in order) the words making up your seed phrase as you find them. Done. </p><p>You can simply stroll through border control with a completely innocuous looking book, knowing that hidden within it is your bitcoin savings. </p><h2>Memorization</h2><p>I mention this last specifically because all the other options presented above are much safer for most people, especially given that Border Wallets is a system set up specifically to aid peoples’ ability to memorize their seed phrase in a safer way. In the event that for some reason that is not an option, just memorizing your seed phrase as it is can be a path to take. </p><p>But I must stress that this is very risky for many people. If you go this route, be <em>very careful</em>. Test yourself numerous times, memorize your phrase and give yourself a week of not looking at it. Repeat it to yourself in your head every day. At the end of this period write down what you remember and compare it to the original copy. Do this a few times. </p><p>When it comes time to leave, <em>as soon as you possibly can after arriving at your destination write it down again and create a physical copy</em>. This is by no means the best, or safest, option for transporting your Bitcoin keys across a border. But sometimes people find themselves in a situation with limited options. This should be a last resort. </p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>The list above of tools for transporting your seed phrase across an international border are by no means exhaustive. There are numerous other options for ways to accomplish this, all with their own trade offs in terms of risk of loss or detection. I’m sure that if many of you reading this put your minds to it you could come up with your own methods for doing so. </p><p>The options here were chosen because of the reliability, simplicity, and the safety against loss. If you feel the need or desire to venture into more complicated or self created ways to transport your seed, I recommend <em>extreme</em> caution in doing so. The options above should be applicable and useful for the vast majority of situations people can find themselves in, and are some of the safest ways to do so. </p><p>Keep these tools in mind, one day they might make the difference between starting over somewhere destitute, or starting over somewhere with your accumulated wealth intact. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQzODQ4ODEwMDYzMTI2/default_someone_fleeing_across_an_international_border_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQzODQ4ODEwMDYzMTI2/default_someone_fleeing_across_an_international_border_1.jpg"><media:title>default_someone_fleeing_across_an_international_border_1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Weekly Reorg: This Time Is Different]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ironically, miners were the big winners at this turn of the epoch.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/weekly-reorg-this-time-is-different</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/weekly-reorg-this-time-is-different</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Bergeron]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 13:56:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQyNDE0ODI3ODU3MTc0/default_church_demolition_2.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/harry_sudock">Harry Sudock</a> has a wager with <a href="https://twitter.com/_DannyKnowles">Danny Knowles</a> of What Bitcoin Did fame about the prospect of a 50 BTC block reward in this new epoch. Putting aside a couple of <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1727658038994325596">fat fingers</a>, the last time this happened was over 4000 days ago. </p><p>Late last Friday night, his bet almost hit on the very <a href="https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000320283a032748cef8227873ff4872689bf23f1cda83a5">first halving block</a>, a 40.751 BTC stunner. </p><p>Ironically, miners were the big winners at this turn of the epoch, netting just over <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1781878036947976672">100 million dollars</a> in total revenue on the day — almost five times the previous all-time high.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The days around the halving, visualized as block fee rates.<a href="https://t.co/FP3PfGHAiB">https://t.co/FP3PfGHAiB</a> <a href="https://t.co/xcS22GPw79">pic.twitter.com/xcS22GPw79</a></p>&mdash; softsimon (@softsimon_) <a href="https://twitter.com/softsimon_/status/1782081378345263256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Beyond the numbers, this time felt different. While the halving is usually a reminder of Bitcoin’s reliability, this year’s event was anything but predictable. On and off-chain, significant narratives converged and culminated in an unprecedented climax. I wasn’t there for the first halving but the previous two events seemed inconsequential. Somehow, block 840,000 felt like it ushered in a new era. </p><p>Culturally, Bitcoin appears to be closing in on escape velocity. Four years ago, you would’ve been hard-pressed to find a Bitcoiner who did not rally under the maximalism flag. Hot off the heels of the blocksize war and a brutal bear market, orthodoxy reigned supreme. </p><p>Today, the landscape is unrecognizable. Piety is openly mocked and most of the high priests have been exiled. Apostasy is trending. We’ve broken out of the insular mold — everyone is a Bitcoiner.</p><h2>Money for enemies</h2><p>Of course, with the dominant cultural institution having fallen, the <a href="https://twitter.com/achow101/status/1781705978309677490">barbarians</a> are at the door. The holy blockchain is being pillaged and no Bitcoin node is safe. At the risk of using yet another analogy, it’s a true Berlin Wall moment. Speculative mercenaries have crossed over and they’re finding the place pretty comfy. Ordinals, BRC20s, Runes. It’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1781660836198576362">degen</a> world and we're all living in it. </p><p>As expected, this defacing of Bitcoin’s sanctity isn’t sitting well with the old guard. They have been busy denouncing this behavior, adamant that heretics should be <s>filtered</s> ostracized. “Bitcoin must not be associated with scams.” Thumping their bible, they have seemingly little regard for the permissionless ideals of the system. Sinners should repent or burn in hell. Their culture must prevail, lest Bitcoin has failed. </p><p>Not since the Silk Road has a Bitcoin use case been so widely controversial. Blasphemous, I know, but hardly surprising. The free market has a way of exposing the hypocrisy of its most ardent proponents. </p><p>I empathize with the idea that this rampant speculation is damaging for most of its participants. Fiat has thrown the average person’s financial incentives so out of whack that gambling is now perceived as EV+. Memecoins are Gen Z’s lottery tickets and Bitcoin memecoins are the new meta. </p><p>If you’ve dedicated your life to freedom money in the hope of distancing yourself and your loved ones from this exact behavior, it’s pretty depressing to see it rear its ugly head on your turf. Indeed, those who seek to create value should hate nothing more than to see others throw it down the drain. On the other hand, Bitcoin makes no such moral or ethical judgment. Salvation isn’t promised or expected from anyone who adopts it. It is both for the best of us, and the worst.<br></p><h2>The scaling fumble</h2><p>The halving also put a spotlight on Bitcoin’s awkward technological state. Unless you were among the privileged few with existing Lightning liquidity, Bitcoin was practically unusable as a payment method over the weekend. You can imagine the dunk fest on Twitter when it was suggested LN nodes <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1781730620198252656">disable routing</a> to avoid costly force closures. </p><p>I won’t pretend there is an easy way out of this predicament. Sure, we can bury our heads in the sand and pretend the current activity is unsustainable. We can <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPierre/status/1781843634192515158">circlejerk </a>about UTXO and channel management.</p><p>Another option is to <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1781787427624952071">meet users where they are</a>. Drop the ideological arrogance and accept that certain tradeoffs are acceptable, if not necessary, to build a global and reliable payment system. It’s a tough pill to swallow but trust-based alternatives are both viable and, for all intents and purposes, probably superior to the gymnastics currently required by “trustless” alternatives. </p><p>This is why I choose to remain optimistic about the road ahead. The <a href="https://twitter.com/callebtc/status/1781964636012593423">progress</a> around ecash mints is awe-inspiring if you ask me. It allows us to leverage Lightning’s strength while addressing the last-mile problem that has plagued it. It opens up a world of possibilities for builders to improve on existing custodial solutions and get them out of the silos they currently operate in. <br><br>Meanwhile, we can continue working on more <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/timeout-trees-a-solution-to-scaling-lightning-network-lsps">ambitious</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/robin_linus/status/1781832291938877704">proposals</a> and attempt to reduce or remove trust assumptions. Bitcoin’s properties shouldn’t be easily conceded for the sake of mass adoption. That said, the devil is in the details and complexity often comes at the expense of user experience. Not all payments are the same and most probably shouldn’t be burdened with the cost of on-chain censorship resistance. </p><p>At least from a technical perspective, this is no Bitcoin renaissance. It’s more of a case of everything old is new again. </p><p>From Satoshi Dice to Magic Eden. </p><p>From Counterparty to Runes. </p><p>From Digicash to Fedimints.</p><p>We’ve seen this story before except this time IS different. </p><p>This time we have to foot the bill for our success and the hubris that came with it.<br><br>We can’t afford to be cute anymore. This time we’re going to have to do even better. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQyNDE0ODI3ODU3MTc0/default_church_demolition_2.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQyNDE0ODI3ODU3MTc0/default_church_demolition_2.jpg"><media:title>default_church_demolition_2</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blackrock Bitcoin ETF Enters Top 10 for Longest Inflows]]></title><description><![CDATA[Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT joins the top 10 ETFs with the longest daily inflows streak, solidifying its position as a leader in the US Spot ETFs market.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-enters-top-10-for-longest-inflows</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-enters-top-10-for-longest-inflows</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 12:48:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODg4MDg0NDM2NjMx/wall-street-otc-bitcoin-trading-desks-see-record-volumes-as-price-hits-52-week-highs.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock's <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">Bitcoin ETF</a>, IBIT, is now one of the top 10 ETFs of all-time, at least when it comes to maintaining its streak of daily investment inflows.</p><p>As of Tuesday, April 23, IBIT has seen 70 days of inflows, meaning that the fund has seen a positive increase in its total holdings of the underlying asset, in this case spot Bitcoin.

It doesn’t have a physical address, or a specific place you can track it down. It’s everywhere. This is what gives Bitcoin its superpowers, what makes it a truly decentralized and globally accessible monetary network. Your bitcoin isn’t stored in your wallet but at Bitcoin addresses recorded by every computer running a Bitcoin node all over the world. Your wallet simply stores the private keys that allow you to control bitcoin at those addresses.</p><p>That means that your Bitcoin can be accessed from anywhere in the world. In this way, Bitcoin gives <em>you</em> superpowers as well. You can “take” your Bitcoin with you wherever you go. All you need to do is bring your private keys with you, and it is accessible and spendable from any point on the planet where you can access the internet. </p><p>This can wind up being one of the most valuable and important abilities in a world that is becoming increasingly politically and economically unstable. Every day hundreds of thousands of people for one reason or another are picking up everything they can carry and leaving their home country for somewhere else. Somewhere that is safer, somewhere with more economic security and opportunities, somewhere they will not be persecuted for political or religious reasons. </p><p>The problem with doing this, is inevitably you have to cross a border. Generally, that means, except in the most extreme circumstances, dealing with customs agents employed by your government. Governments worldwide place extreme restrictions on financial assets, money, and other valuables you may cross the border with. They don’t like when people try to remove monetary goods from their local economy without permission. </p><p>Attempting to flee your country for your own safety or to attain better opportunities is greatly complicated by this reality. In many cases, it means having to leave behind savings, valuables or anything the government would not allow you to bring with you when leaving. </p><p>Bitcoin is the answer to this problem. </p><h2>Why Bitcoin is So Effective at Crossing Borders</h2><p>Your Bitcoin is accessible from everywhere in the world, you just need to keep your private keys with you. And typically, wallets allow you to restore your private keys using a 12-24 word seed phrase. Carrying 12-24 words with you is infinitely easier than a bundle of cash, or large amounts of gold or jewelry. Traditional assets are bulky, physical, and identifiable. </p><h3>Bitcoin is Permissionless</h3><p>Bitcoin is permissionless, as the ability for network participants to join and leave the network at will is not mediated by a centralized party. The agency of individuals to participate is solely at their discretion. By virtue of existing outside of the traditional banking and financial system, Bitcoin’s supranational qualities make it uniquely fit for entering and exiting national jurisdictions.<br><br>Pseudonymity is a key component of Bitcon’s permissionless nature. By possessing a private key to sign transactions, individuals can access and control their wealth regardless of their relationship with their country of residence. While there are caveats in that individuals incur risk in transgressing regulation, and must take responsibility to protect their privacy (for example, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/fully-noded-the-basics-and-benefits-of-running-a-bitcoin-node">running a node</a> can help protect your privacy when interacting with the Bitcoin network).</p><h3>Bitcoin is Decentralized</h3><p>Enabling Bitcoin’s permissionlessness is its decentralization. With a globally distributed network of miners and validating nodes, the Bitcoin ledger has amassed resilience to control by centralized entities including companies and governments. </p><p>The central enabling constraint of Bitcoin as a money – its 21 million supply cap – is also a key factor in its suitability for individuals to retain wealth between national jurisdictions. While the public-private key architecture of the network is of course beneficial, it would be much less impactful (and likely obsolete) if it were not for the fact that Bitcoin’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/bitcoin-has-no-top-because-fiat-has-no-bottom-understanding-monetary-debasement">sound monetary policy</a> enables wealth to be <em>stored </em>for an indefinite period of time.</p><p>By existing on computers around the world across political jurisdictions, and continually utilizing proof-of-work consensus to ensure the integrity of the ledger every 10 minutes, both <em>access </em>and <em>fidelity </em>of one’s wealth can be retained over time.</p><h3>The Security of Cryptography</h3><p>Access to and security of private keys are another critical aspect when it comes to transcending national borders. Bitcoin private keys are typically <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/private-key">256-bit numbers</a>, meaning that the probability of guessing a private key – known as a “brute force” method – is statistically incredibly unlikely. So unlikely, in fact, that you are more likely to select a specific atom from all that currently exist in the universe than you are to randomly guess a bitcoin private key.<br><br>It should be noted that this security relies on an unproven (and debatably <em>unprovable</em>) assumption that P!=NP, which is the basis for cryptographic security in general. Nuances aside, the cryptographic nature of Bitcoin private keys provides a nearly impenetrable bulwark against confiscation – another essential component that makes Bitcoin a useful tool for transcending international borders.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>Traditional mechanisms for storing and transferring wealth – gold, fiat currency, commodities and even art – <em>can </em>achieve their stated outcomes, but fall short of providing an efficient, secure and reliable means of doing so. Bitcoin, as the first truly decentralized instance of digital cash, surpasses its competitors in providing permissionless access and financial freedom to its users.</p><p>When it comes to crossing borders, and existing without the auspices of governmental authorities, the cryptographic, sound and immutable qualities of Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention are a step-change in how individuals can express their agency and autonomy. While each of Bitcoin’s fundamental qualities on their own are indeed useful, in combination, they offer an increasingly unstoppable means for self-sovereignty that puts individuals back in control of their wealth.</p><p>Hopefully now, if you didn’t already, you can understand the immense power that Bitcoin offers people in protecting and maintaining control of their money in even the worst of circumstances someone can find themselves in. It truly is a superpower. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTI0NjIzNDYyNzA0NDA2/ledger-10-steps--borderless---article-preview-1.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTI0NjIzNDYyNzA0NDA2/ledger-10-steps--borderless---article-preview-1.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps--borderless---article-preview-1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Rant Against Ordinals]]></title><description><![CDATA[A case against Ordinals and Inscriptions, and why it is something people should not only not support, but speak against.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/a-rant-against-ordinals</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/a-rant-against-ordinals</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Will Schoellkopf]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 14:08:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTE5MzU0NjExNTc0MjI2/default_bitcoin_collectible_trading_cards_1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>On Free Speech</h2><p>President of Bitcoin Magazine, Mike Germano, has dared me to publish this rant with the following meme:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTE5MzkyOTk3OTA5Nzgy/image8.png" height="800" width="804">

                    </figure>
                    <p>To all the haters, yes, even in Bitcoin Magazine can free debate flourish. I’m grateful for the opportunity to submit a dissenting opinion about Ordinals. With technical editor Shinobi at the helm, writers’ contributions are permissionless!</p><h2>On Technical Feats</h2><p>I appreciate Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo’s posts detailing all of Bitcoin’s history, but he is morally wrong on Ordinals, just as he was on the Ethereum Merge:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTE5MzkyNzI5NDc0MzI2/image2.png" height="800" width="1077">
                        <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1570383464360251398?s=20">https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1570383464360251398?s=20</a></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>While the Merge was a great technical feat for Ethereum, the switch to Proof of Stake only made it even less decentralized. And with <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor">Casey’s</a> technical feat of Ordinals, he also hurts Bitcoin by making it less fungible.</p><p>On Peter McCormack’s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-bitcoin-did-with-peter-mccormack/id1317356120?i=1000642787562">What Bitcoin Did</a> podcast, Pete Rizzo argued that “in the worst case, people who own ordinals at least own some bitcoin.”</p><p>No. The worst case is that people realize they’ve been scammed and never want to touch Bitcoin again.</p><h2>On Making Money</h2><p>Some try to defend that flipping Ordinals for profit is not a scam, but simply people willingly gambling on speculation. Likewise, many people bought bitcoin at the cycle top in 2021 without having done any research, and haven't touched Bitcoin since realizing losses. Speculators buy Ordinals for the same reason they buy bitcoin: to make money. </p><p>However, on this issue, the position of Bitcoin Maxis is clear:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTE5MzkyNzI5NDA4OTc4/image4.png" height="800" width="575">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Bitcoin is not an intangible asset that suffers from the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">Greater Fool Theory</a> as Ordinals. Two meaningful ways saving in Bitcoin contrasts with gambling on Ordinals are network effects and actual limited supply. Many copycat altcoins have been issued, but none have the network effects of the OG. Additionally, most altcoins get dropped out of the air via Proof-of-Stake, with little physical cost to greater issuance. Bitcoin is only issued via Proof-of-Work, putting real weight and staying power behind its value.</p><p>Bitcoin Maxis who are here to fix the money, know that we don’t buy Bitcoin to make money, but to fix the world.</p><h2>On Rare Collections</h2><p>On What Bitcoin Did, McCormack makes the case that no one is buying Ordinals to actually collect. Some Ordinals supporters have deluded themselves to the point that they think while most are trying to flip, some are actually collecting. Esteemed art auction house Sotheby’s held an auction in January 2024 for ordinals, but putting their brand behind this “collection” doesn’t make it so.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTE5MzkyNzI5NDA4Nzkw/image1.png" height="549" width="1200">
                        <figcaption><a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale">https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale</a></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I concede that whether or not I am morally opposed doesn’t change the fact that there are people who find value in collecting worthless things. Some may argue that Sotheby’s isn’t scamming anyone if they are a willing buyer for digital art. However, it is a scam because they’re not buying digital art since they don’t actually own anything. I can add the same digital art to any transaction. It’s only with their shared delusion that by using the ordinal protocol, same as their peers, the digital art they own in their transaction is more valued than the digital art in mine.</p><p>What I will NOT concede is the notion that ordinals and NFTs are unarbitrary—they are. I can take the jpeg of every Quantum Cat, and re-release the same 3000 cat collection, and tell people mine don’t cost 0.1 bitcoin each, but only 0.0001 bitcoin each. <em>Such cheaper</em>. Much better deal!! There’s nothing rare or special about it. Do people want to pay Udi or Sotheby’s the 0.1 bitcoin to own the address to the Sat to the cat in their collection, or the same cat in mine? In fact, a copycat collection has already been created trying to do just that, called <a href="https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/quantumrats">Quantum Rats</a>.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTE5MzkyOTk3ODQ0MjQ2/image7.png" height="800" width="765">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Of course adding other collections isn’t quite as direct as diluting supply of an existing one, but it’s close enough. If a collection starts small and gets so expensive that the creators make a separate but similar collection with the purpose of making them available for more people, it’s really just to scam more people. It’s a moral judgment, but Ordinals don’t uphold the values of a Bitcoin Maximalist. Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million, but there’s no limit to the number of Ordinal collections that can be created. Next, Udi might release “mutant” quantum cats, or “bored” quantum cats, which become more popular and make the originals all worthless.</p><p>That’s the scam. That’s the rug pull.</p><p>The rug pull formula is simple: Start a “rare” collection, hype it up with wash trading with yourself and influencers, then leave a sucker holding the bag.</p><p>Then do it again, and again, and again.</p><p>Bitcoin could succumb to “greater fool theory” too, but the difference is the network effect that has made Bitcoin survive unlike any other pump and dump crypto.</p><h2>On Digital Art Ownership</h2><p>On the contrary, owning digital art does exist — intellectual property exists. I can pay for a cover art design, so I own the art for Bitcoin Girl: Save the World. I own the files and I make the merch. If anyone tries to sell physical merchandise with digital art I own, then it’s copyright infringement.</p><figure>

                    <p>Think about all the digital files or character art for every video game or Pixar animated movie. Digital art rights exist, they are real, and they can be used to make new movies or products.</p><h2>On Filtering and Censorship</h2><p>I’m not trying to filter out ordinals or censor transactions, but I think supporting ordinals is wrong. For Bitcoin to succeed, it needs to be money for enemies. However, Bitcoin Maxis should still champion for people to do their own research. </p><p>Scammers are always going to scam but I’m not going to support it. I’ll still allow it, though thankfully ordinals don’t need my permission anyways.</p><p>I’m not trying to break Bitcoin by adding filtering or censorship, but I can still be opposed. </p><p>Hodlonaut put my position on ordinals succinctly:</p><figure>

<p>According to 2B4CH founder and chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/ZLOK">Yves Bennaïm</a>, this move would help Switzerland maintain its political neutrality and sovereignty in an uncertain global environment. </p><p>"We are in the process of completing the organizational preparations for the committee and preparing the documents that must be submitted to the State Chancellery in order to start the process," Bennaïm stated.</p><p>To achieve a referendum under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, the advocates must collect 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens within 18 months. With Switzerland's population around 8.77 million, roughly 1.15% of the populace needs to sign the petition. This signature requirement posed challenges when 2B4CH attempted a similar referendum in 2021.</p><figure>

"By including Bitcoin in its reserves, Switzerland would mark its independence from the European Central Bank. Such a step would strengthen our neutrality," Meisser said.</p><p>Meisser believes adopting Bitcoin could make Switzerland billions; he previously advised the SNB to allocate over $1 billion monthly to BTC instead of German bonds. However, SNB Chair Thomas Jordan has thus far resisted, claiming Bitcoin does not meet the reserve criteria.</p><p>The campaign has won support from Bitcoin advocates globally, including German politician <a href="https://twitter.com/JoanaCotar">Joana Cotar</a>.

                    <p>Ordinals, numbering schemes for satoshis, have sparked controversy but also created an emerging market since its launch. These satoshis can also be classified by rarity, with “epic satoshis” being among the rarest, because they only occur at each halving epoch, which is every 210,00 blocks or approximately every four years. This scarcity has made these satoshis more valuable amongst those participating in the Ordinals market.</p><p>The rarity of Ordinals have been labeled with six different ranks, as described below.</p><p>Ordinals rarity levels:</p><p>+ common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block</p><p>+ uncommon: The first sat of each block</p><p>+ rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period</p><p><strong>+ epic: The first sat of each halving epoch</strong></p><p>+ legendary: The first sat of each cycle</p><p>+ mythic: The first sat of the genesis block</p><p>The value of an epic satoshi is significant enough to attract attention from miners, developers, investors, and collectors. Bitcoin block 840,000, coinciding with the halving, includes an epic satoshi, intensifying interest in the first block of the halving.</p><p>Marketplaces for Ordinals, lists rare satoshis at higher prices than what 1 normal satoshi is normally worth at a given time. These market's include high class auction houses like Sotheby’s, signaling mainstream interest and attention.</p><p>As Ordinals and related markets continue to grow, questions arise about their impact on Bitcoin's ecosystem. The introduction of new protocols like Runes adds complexity, attracting miners and investors seeking opportunities in this evolving landscape, as the incentives tied to “rare satoshis” and Ordinals could introduce new strategies amongst Bitcoin miners.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyNjg3OTY1/bitcoin-mining.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyNjg3OTY1/bitcoin-mining.png"><media:title>bitcoin-mining</media:title><media:text>Bitcoin miners conduct the mining process to dig up rewards from the network.

<p>The prize will be awarded to the individual or institution that does the most for Bitcoin and human rights in each halving era, and the recipient will receive a monetary award of 1 BTC.</p><p>“We wanted to help inspire people to use Bitcoin to advance human rights — to help more people achieve economic liberation around the world — and we thought that creating a prize that could be persistent throughout the early lifecycle of Bitcoin would be one way to do it,” Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation, told Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>“The halving is a very important day. It’s something that anyone can celebrate, regardless of what country or situation they’re in or who they are, and it’s a great time to announce a Bitcoin-related prize,” he added.</p><p>The prize winner, or Laureate, for the 2009-2012 era is Hal Finney himself, and his 1 BTC prize will go to “causes that matter to Hal’s family,” according to Gladstein.</p><p>The HRF will work with the Finney family to appoint a seven-person “Genesis Committee” that will select Laureates for the 2012-2016, 2016-2020 and 2020-2024 eras. Starting with the 2024-2028 era, a new committee will be composed to select the winner of the award.</p><p>A maximum of two Laureates can be selected for each era. In the event of two Laureates being chosen, each Laureate will receive 50 million satoshis (half of a bitcoin).</p><p>To be considered for the prize, individuals or institutions must excel in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Educating large numbers of people about Bitcoin</li><li>Demonstrating how people can exercise financial freedom by being their own bank using Bitcoin</li><li>Making notable contributions to Bitcoin’s codebase</li><li>Helping to make Bitcoin more accessible to the average person, especially those living under authoritarian regimes</li><li>Following in Hal’s footsteps of advocating for digital privacy</li></ul><p>A total of 33 Finney Freedom Prizes will be awarded, one for each Bitcoin halving era.

The event features two core components: i) <em>Artificial Intelligence + Business Intelligence</em>, and ii) <a href="https://bm.b.tc/bitcoin-for-corporations-bm"><em>Bitcoin for Corporations</em></a>. Bitcoin Magazine will serve as the exclusive livestream partner of the<em> Bitcoin for Corporations</em> segment on May 1 - May 2, 2024, highlighting the case for Bitcoin as a critical part of corporate strategy.<br><br>MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is <a href="https://bm.b.tc/bitcoin-for-corporations-bm">scheduled</a> to deliver keynote remarks addressing how Bitcoin’s role as a store-of-value has been cemented post-approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. David Marcus, <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">LightSpark</a> CEO and former Meta Executive, will appear alongside Saylor to explore the innovation taking place on the Bitcoin network. The pair will discuss how Bitcoin as “money over IP” and Bitcoin Layer 2 technologies are primed to transform how businesses facilitate transactions.</p><p>MicroStrategy Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations, Shirish Jajodia noted the groundswell of momentum in the Bitcoin industry: “MicroStrategy has uniquely executed its Bitcoin strategy, benefitting from bitcoin’s properties as a superior long-term store-of-value. Our objective is to open-source our playbook and support bitcoin adoption at the enterprise level. We are excited to spread this message in partnership with Bitcoin Magazine and believe we are at a critical juncture in terms of Bitcoin taking its place in boardrooms around the world.”<br><br>The event comes on the heels of MicroStrategy’s continued doubling down on bitcoin – the firm recently conducted two convertible bond offerings raising proceeds of $1.4 billion, with much of the net proceeds used to purchase more bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/">bitcoin holdings</a> total more than 1% of the total supply, now worth $13.5 billion. MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang will present the MicroStrategy Playbook for Corporates along with Michael Saylor to discuss opportunities to emulate the firm’s success and identify catalysts for other corporations to follow suit.</p><figure>

The code simply specifies a starting reward of 50 BTC per block and modifies that value each halving by cutting it in half.</li></ul><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODUxMjg5MzEyMDQ0MDc3/image1.png" height="412" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <ul><li>The total supply of Bitcoin is actually not 21 million coins. Because of how the code in Bitcoin actually works, simply cutting the supply in half every halving, there will only ever be 20999999.97690 BTC in circulation by the time the coinbase subsidy drops to 0 satoshis. </li><li>The supply, due to a quirk in how the programming language (C++) that Bitcoin is written in, was not capped at all originally. In 2214 the entire supply would have started issuing again, resetting the block reward back to 50 BTC per block and going through the issuance of another 21 million coins again. The BIP is written up in a joking manner, but this was corrected by <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki">BIP 42</a> in 2014. </li><li>The halving supply curve in combination with the total supply has an interesting property. During the first subsidy period of 50 BTC coinbase rewards, 50% of the supply entered circulation. In the next halving period of 25 BTC rewards, 25% of the supply entered circulation. Each halving the value of the coinbase reward is the percentage of the total supply that enters circulation. </li><li>During the first halving when the block reward decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC, a group of miners altered their Bitcoin clients and <a href="https://x.com/jgarzik/status/468711849752416257?s=46&t=pCLl2N2eGbvcwI459PSAUw">attempted to continue mining on a chain where the block subsidy remained 50 BTC</a> after the halving. </li></ul><p>A lot of less technical people, or newer people, in this space probably weren’t aware of most of these little factoids. Interesting little tidbits about things tend to fade off into the historical memory and disappear. If we do wind up seeing a reorg this halving over the Epic sat in block 840,000, maybe in 15-20 years most people using Bitcoin then similarly won’t remember or know such an event occurred back in 2024. </p><p>If you are lucky enough to be around now to see these little moments in history, cherish the experience. They’re once in a lifetime things you can look back on, and probably use to annoy people around you despite their lack of caring. </p><p>Happy Halving everyone. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODUxMjY1NDIxMjg4NDkz/default_a_bitcoiner_hosting_a_quiz_show_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODUxMjY1NDIxMjg4NDkz/default_a_bitcoiner_hosting_a_quiz_show_0.jpg"><media:title>default_a_bitcoiner_hosting_a_quiz_show_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODUxMjg5MzEyMDQ0MDc3/image1.png"><media:title>image1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Halving Holiday]]></title><description><![CDATA[A look at the halving through the lens of holidays and what their cultural significance is.

While different cultures and religions have their own unique customs and traditions, the entire human race seems to share an underlying propensity to recognize certain occasions as distinct from otherwise ordinary days. </p><p>Finally, something we can all agree on! While the word “holiday” or Holy Day, literally means a day that is set apart, there are also examples of special occasions which extend beyond a 24 hour period such as Hanukkah, Ramadan or even the 12 days of Christmas. After only 13 years since its inception, the nascent Bitcoin community has also begun observing its own special occasions: Jan 3rd, October 31st and Bitcoin Pizza Day, to name a few. </p><p>Then, about every 4 years, there’s the big one. </p><figure>

                    <p>Unlike Birthdays, Kwanza or Presidents’ Day, I would argue there are aspects of Bitcoin’s Halving which make it somewhat extraordinary compared to our standard understanding of holidays and their accompanying traditions. Perhaps in ways that even Bitcoin’s most ardent fanatics have yet to fully appreciate. It’s not that the halving is more important than Christmas or more memorable than a bar mitzvah. But the implications and distinct properties which take place every 240,000 blocks, are simply unlike any other “holiday” that humans are accustomed to observing. </p><p>We are approaching Bitcoin’s 4th ever Halving at block height 840,000 which marks the beginning of a new epoch and a reduction of the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. But we don’t know exactly what day or time it will take place. You can’t exactly mark the occasion on your calendar because it is dependent on block time not clock time. It is a quadrennial occasion, occurring every 4 years, but it also has a clearly demarcated finale: there will only ever be 32 halvings. Overall, its predictability is somewhat of a paradox. We know for sure the block height, reward change and total number of halvings while having no idea the time it will occur, the impact on bitcoin’s valuation or the critical metric of subsequent network hashrate. Inevitable arguments and assertions about whether or not “the halving is priced in” are as futile as other classic bitcoin debates such as stainless steel vs cast iron, bitcoin vs Bitcoin or my personal favorite: sats vs bits.</p><p>New Year's Eve might be the closest example we have in terms of sharing similar holiday type dynamics with the Halving. The anticipation of a brand new year or a brand new epoch. The tendency to pause and reflect on the previous year or the previous epoch. The mystery of what a fresh 12 months will bring or the mystery of what the next epoch has in store. But New Year’s Eve happens every December 31st at midnight. Nothing is fundamentally different about the world on January 1st and as far as we can tell, humans will continue to repeat this routine indefinitely into the future. Again, making these distinctions isn’t meant to suggest one is “better than the other” but more to highlight the ways in which The Halving is particularly unique as an emergent cultural phenomenon. </p><p>We can acknowledge that the implications of The Halving currently only impact a small subset of the world’s population. Those who hold, transact with or mine bitcoin are really the only ones even paying attention. But it's fun to consider how the commemoration of The Halving might evolve and expand as worldwide adoption of this pristine asset continues to accelerate. Uncertainty and anticipation of the occasion aside, the underlying celebratory aspect of each halving points to one of Bitcoin’s most important properties which is its perfectly knowable and universally auditable scarcity. There can only ever be 32 total halvings because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. As the block reward is cut in half, the number of bitcoin mined each epoch, is also cut in half. This means that each halving can essentially be understood as a mini-celebration leading up to the eventual cessation of halvings altogether. The 32nd and final halving is of course when the final few sats will finally be mined, circa 2140. If bitcoin continues on its current trajectory and one day becomes the default currency for humans everywhere, it's not far off to imagine that the actual holiday which might be celebrated by future generations could become whatever fateful day it happens to be when block 6,720,000 is mined and the final sats enter into the total supply. I get fomo just thinking about it. </p><p>Even if I live to be 100 years old, that means I will only be around to see bitcoin reach its 18th or 19th epoch. The block reward will be about 10,000 sats and only 20 full coins will be mined by the entire network for the duration of the epoch. Compared to today’s numbers, these facts are simply mind boggling. Rather than lament missing out on the grand finale of bitcoin’s 32nd and final halving, I want to attempt to properly commemorate the handful of halvings I will have the opportunity to experience, starting with the upcoming 4th halving, estimated to take place sometime in April of 2024. Since this is still a new tradition, we’ve yet to establish any sense of cohesion around how to best ring in each epoch. Some high time preference miners might even argue that it's more a day of mourning than a cause for excitement. Because there is no central authority in Bitcoin, there will likely be numerous manifestations when it comes to how various pockets of the bitcoin community will mark the occasion. There’s probably no “wrong” way or even a necessity or expectation for a uniform way to celebrate the halving. But there might be value in exploring some possible ways to make the milestone a little more memorable by borrowing insights from other holidays.</p><p>If we consider the primary ways in which humans have historically marked special occasions we are able to draw some inspiration when it comes to considering ways to approach the upcoming halving and future halvings that will occur in our lifetimes. I would point to 3 elements in particular that I’m interested in exploring further:</p><ol><li>Reflection </li><li>Ritual</li><li>Renewal</li></ol><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> 4 years or 210,000 blocks feels like a long ass time in bitcoin years. This feeling is likely more pronounced in our present day because we are still in the early stages of bitcoin’s existence. Either way, it seems like taking time to reflect on the previous epoch as each halving approaches, could serve us well. A lot has happened since block height 630,000 and taking a moment to pause and consider how far we’ve come, might offer a healthy practice and foster deeper collaboration among those of us working to bring about a universal bitcoin standard. This past epoch we saw, among other highlights: El Salvador adopt bitcoin as legal tender, Microstrategy, Tesla and SpaceX add bitcoin to their corporate treasuries, professional athletes demand their multi-million dollar contracts be paid in bitcoin, USD price going as low as $3k and as high as $69,420 and even politicians adopting strategic talking points in an effort to court bitcoiners. We rallied around Hodlnaut and we collectively changed our profile pictures to include laser eyes. We’ve seen bitcoin super bowl ads and the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs. We’ve made significant progress in a short period of time and reflecting on these moments can allow us to strengthen our resolve to continue fighting alongside fellow bitcoiners, yes, even the ones who enjoy an occasional salad.</p><p><strong>Ritual: </strong>since we don’t know the exact date or time the halving block will be mined, it can be difficult to plan and execute a party or celebration to commemorate the halving. But few subsets of the population are as creative as bitcoiners when it comes to solving problems and this logistical hurdle is nothing compared to the battles we’ve fought and the bears we’ve slain. If we really want to pull off a party that has a moving target for the invitation’s “when” line, we will find a way. Perhaps the key to creating meaningful rituals is to ensure that we’re among fellow bitcoiners at the turn of the halving. By intentionally seeking out a shared celebration, which can be repeated for each halving, we might receive similar benefits found in other holiday traditions such as creating memorable moments, deepening friendships and building community. This seems especially important for younger or newer bitcoiners who are still wrapping their heads around what is even taking place at the halving. But even the OGs might find value and inspiration in experiencing the tangible growth and momentum from epoch to epoch simply by being surrounded by other bitcoiners as the momentous block is mined.</p><p><strong>Renewal:</strong> with each new halving comes new opportunity. It's impossible to predict what the next epoch will bring or what new milestones we’ll achieve. All we can control is our own attitude, posture and commitment to this crazy idea we’ve all bought into and continue to show up for. Bitcoiners have the audacity to believe that a better world is possible. Many of us are here because we’ve rejected the lie that we must accept the prevailing norms of our corrupt monetary system. We envision an optimistic future which allows people to preserve the wealth that they’ve rightfully earned and transact with their peers without requiring permission from tyrannical authorities. It can be easy for us to drift away from this vision, especially as the harsh reality of intense bear markets takes its toll or the latest drama spirals on bitcoin twitter. But with each epoch we have a chance to hit reset on our mindset and return to the original reason for why we’re here to begin with, why we’ve decided to accept the ridicule of friends and family and why we’re more committed to seeing this through than we were when we first started. The practice of renewal offers a fresh sense of hope and reminds us that we are not fighting with each other, but with those who attempt to stand in the way of the sovereignty we are ultimately pursuing. </p><p>By combining these 3 habits and finding ways to implement them into our approach to each halving, I believe we can rediscover common ground, limit petty infighting and accelerate progress towards our shared objective of defeating fiat currency and its toxic societal byproducts. </p><p>The Halving is a unique occasion and a worthy holy day. We frankly don’t have to do anything at all and we will still receive the hard coded benefits of predictable supply and knowable scarcity. But for bitcoiners to truly maximize the potential of each halving, the people behind the protocol must intentionally rise to the occasion of developing rich traditions to effectively commemorate these unique and scarce milestones. </p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Halving Issue”.

This event, also known as the halving, occurs approximately every four years and has far-reaching implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As Bitcoin Magazine prepares for a <a href="https://www.bitcoinhalving.com/">halving livestream</a>, powered by <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, to commemorate this event, it's crucial to understand what the halving is and why it's so important.</p><h2>What is the Bitcoin Halving?</h2><p>The Bitcoin halving refers to the process by which the reward for mining new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain is reduced by half. This reduction occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. </p><p>Not all bitcoin were released onto the market at the same time, but rather new coins are slowly mined by Bitcoin miners every day as a reward for mining new blocks in the blockchain. The halving is encoded into Bitcoin's protocol to control its inflation rate and ensure that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined, making it a deflationary asset.</p><p>In the very beginning of Bitcoin’s history, the first block reward was 50 BTC. After the first halving in 2012, the block reward was cut in half to 25 BTC per block, and then cut in half again in 2016 to 12.5 BTC per block, and once more in 2020 to 6.25 BTC per block. Now, the block reward is getting cut in half to 3.125 BTC per block, with the next halving expected in 2028, cutting the reward down to 1.5625 BTC per block.</p><figure>

                    <p>Bitcoin will continue to cut its new supply creation in half until there is no more bitcoin left to be mined, which is currently slated for the year of 2140 in May.</p><h2>Importance of the Halving</h2><p>The halving event is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it directly impacts the supply of new bitcoins entering circulation. With the block reward reduced, the rate of new bitcoin creation slows down, leading to a gradual decrease in the available supply. This scarcity is a fundamental factor driving Bitcoin's value proposition as a store of value.</p><p>Secondly, the halving has historically been associated with bullish price movements. Previous halvings, such as those in 2012 and 2016, were followed by substantial increases in Bitcoin's price. This pattern is partly attributed to the reduced supply coupled with sustained demand, leading to a potential imbalance that favors price appreciation.</p><figure>

                    <p>Bitcoin has increased around 743% since the last halving in 2020, rising from ~$8,755 to an all time high of $73,790 on March 14, 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, market participants are expecting to see another increase in the price of BTC, as strong institutional demand for the asset is coming in from recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange traded products in the United States, Germany and Hong Kong, as well as the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/london-stock-exchange-to-launch-bitcoin-etn-market-in-may">London Stock Exchange</a> that is getting ready to offer physical Bitcoin exchange traded notes.</p><h2>Bitcoin Magazine and Kraken Halving Livestream</h2><p>To <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoins-biggest-event-kraken-and-bitcoin-magazine-host-the-2024-bitcoin-halving-livestream-event">celebrate</a> this momentous occasion, Bitcoin Magazine is hosting a halving livestream event tonight, powered by Kraken.

You don’t have to be a Princeton economist to understand the impact this will have on the supply and demand dynamics for bitcoin. Beyond the obvious halving of the block reward, a new market has developed around Ordinals which could have a significant impact on what happens to the first block of the halving. Contained within the first block of the halving is an extremely rare “epic sat”. While Ordinals have divided some Bitcoiners on their merit, there is no arguing the impact they have had on Bitcoin.and it raises an important question, could Ordinals cause a blockchain reorg? Through this article we will dig into the basics of a reorg, Ordinals demand, how mining probabilities work, and finally who could pull off a successful reorg. </p><p>Before we dig into this “epic sat”, let’s build an understanding of what a reorg is. The Bitcoin blockchain is a slow and dumb database that creates blocks of data every 10 minutes or so. It continues working as intended, but occasionally, things get tense. When two miners find blocks nearly simultaneously, it creates a temporary fork in the blockchain. This moment of overlap leads to a brief period of uncertainty. These forks are resolved by the network through the longest chain rule, which is when the fork tip of the blockchain with more proof-of-work (the longest chain or aka more blocks) will be adopted as the valid chain. Orphaned blocks from the shorter chain are not included in the longer one, and the transactions they contain are returned to the mempool to be included in future blocks. This process of one chain becoming longer than the other and becoming the accepted version is known as a reorganization, or reorg.</p><figure>
                        
                        <a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/magazines/products/bitcoin-magazine-annual-subscription" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODM4MjE0MTY5NTM2MDk0/inscription.jpg" height="791" width="1200"></a>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Due to the incentive structures built into Bitcoin mining, reorgs are usually resolved as soon as the next block is found and added to the tip of one of the forked chains. This is because finding a block is extremely difficult, and miners are incentivized to work on the longest chain in order to build the next block, and get paid. If they are mining on the short fork, the rest of the network will leave them behind and they will have invalid blocks. The last thing you would want is to build a block that is rejected by the network because you’ve built a block on a chain and are rejected by the network due to the longest chain rule. During the reorg period of a fork, miners build on whichever chain fork hits their node first and try to build a block to get the longest chain.</p><p>Now don’t get worried about reorgs. They happen every couple of months (on average) and typically involve one or two blocks. These short reorgs are part of the network’s regular operation and quickly resolve without any significant impact on the network and its users. It’s worth noting that deep reorgs that consist of many blocks are rare and, correspondingly, more disruptive. They can be triggered by a network split such as what happened in the Blocksize wars, or a new large miner coming to the network, or an attempt to double-spend transactions (this is very rare).</p><h2>Most Recent Reorgs</h2><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The Bitcoin protocol and its incentives are designed so that there’s a low likelihood of deep reorgs occurring. Consensus rules and incentives are meant to keep the network stable and secure. For example, most exchanges and payment processors require that a transaction be confirmed by a set number of times—usually six or more—before a transaction can be considered final, thus greatly reducing the chances of it being unwound by a reorg. Small reorgs happen and are mundane and frequent operations within the Bitcoin blockchain, but large reorgs are notable and very irregular.</p><h2>About That Epic Sat</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the buzz about Ordinals, that is “a numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and transferring individual sats”. Some argue that Ordinals are a scam and they have no place in Bitcoin, but here’s the thing, an emerging market is rapidly growing around Ordinals. For now, they are here, and they are getting attention from miners, devs, VC, collectors, scammers, and haters alike.</p><p>When it comes to Ordinals, they are classified by their “rarity” and markets determine value. </p><p>Ordinals rarity levels:</p><p>+ common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block</p><p>+ uncommon: The first sat of each block</p><p>+ rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period</p><p>+ epic: The first sat of each halving epoch</p><p>+ legendary: The first sat of each cycle</p><p>+ mythic: The first sat of the genesis block</p><p>If we consider the scenario where all Bitcoin has been mined, which implies that all 21 million bitcoins (or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis) are in circulation, we can calculate the total quantity of each level of Ordinals:</p><ul><li>Uncommon: There would be a total of 6,929,999 uncommon satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each block.</li><li>Rare: There would be a total of approximately 3,437 rare satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each difficulty adjustment period.</li><li>Epic: There would be a total of 32 epic satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each halving epoch.</li><li>Legendary: There would be approximately 5 legendary satoshis, corresponding to the first satoshi of each cycle (noting a slight approximation due to division).</li><li>Mythic: There is 1 mythic satoshi, which is the first sat of the genesis block.</li></ul><p><br>These figures give an overview of how the rarity classifications would distribute across the total supply of satoshis once all Bitcoin is mined, showcasing the unique and scarce nature of certain satoshis within the Bitcoin network. </p><h2>The Ordinals Market and Beyond</h2><p>Over the past 12 months we’ve seen rapid development in Ordinals technology and markets. Ordinals markets first emerged in Discord back channels where OTC deals were being made, but as demand has grown, digital marketplaces have developed for buying and selling Ordinals. US Based Magisat.io lists various types of Ordinals and has Rare sats listed for a staggering 3.49 BTC. This valuation has led to the creation of additional inventory of Ordinals beyond the category that was first described in the Ordinals documentation.</p><h2>Current Market on Magisat.io for standard Ordinals</h2><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>This data shows that there is a small but growing demand for Ordinals. You can see the volume for Rare amd Uncommon Ordinals are greater than 26 BTC at the time of writing this. Keep in mind that this is only one marketplace and there are a growing number of OTC deals that are happening between buyers and sellers not to mention demand and business happening in other parts of the world.</p><p>Looking beyond Ordinals marketplaces we are now seeing Ordinals make their way to legendary auction house Sotheby’s further propelling the phenomenon towards the mainstream. If you look across the Pacific Ocean there is also significant demand for Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which would not be possible without Ordinals. So the demand for Ordinals is real and it is growing, not waning. </p><p>The last significant item of note that could impact demand for this first block of the halving is the activation of Runes. Runes is another protocol released by the same creator of Ordinals, but the aim of Runes is to make a more efficient token protocol. The kicker on this is that with it going live in the first block of the halving, this alone will cause a significant demand to issue these new tokens as quickly as possible, presumably the first Runes issued will be more valuable than later issued Runes. “Yes there will be reorg incentive for block 840,000, but it's not for epic sat -- it's for the 20btc in fees from Casey's Runes.” said Charlie Spears on X. This fee revenue call is speculation but it comes from observation from previous Ordinals and BRC20 activity. </p><h2>Sifting For Sats</h2><p>In Bitcoin, "dust" refers to an amount of bitcoin so small that it cannot be spent because the cost of a transaction fee would be higher than the amount itself. The concept of a "dust limit" therefore varies depending on the transaction fee and the type of transaction being made. However, there are general guidelines for what is considered dust, based on the type of Bitcoin script or address being used.</p><p>The dust limit is calculated based on the size of the inputs and outputs that make up a transaction. For a transaction to be relayed by most nodes and mined, its outputs must be above the dust limit. The dust limit for a standard P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) transaction output is commonly considered to be 546 satoshis when using the default minimum relay fee of 1 satoshi per byte, but this can vary depending on the network conditions and the policies of individual nodes.</p><p>For different script types, the dust limit calculation takes into account the size of the script and therefore can vary:</p><ul><li>P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key Hash): This is the most common type, and its dust limit is usually around 546 satoshis.</li></ul><ul><li>P2SH (Pay-to-Script Hash): Outputs for P2SH transactions can have a slightly higher dust limit because the script itself is more complex, requiring more data to be included in a transaction.</li></ul><ul><li>P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key Hash) and P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script Hash): These SegWit (Segregated Witness) transactions have different weight calculations, leading to lower fees for the same amount of data. Consequently, the dust limit for SegWit transactions can be lower than for traditional P2PKH transactions. For P2WPKH, the dust limit might be closer to 294 satoshis.</li></ul><ul><li>MultiSig: Transactions involving multiple signatures (MultiSig) have higher dust limits due to the increased data size required to accommodate multiple signatures.</li></ul><p>The exact dust limit can vary because it depends on the transaction's size and the current fee market. Additionally, changes in Bitcoin's protocol or node policies can affect these thresholds. It's also worth noting that some wallets and services might set their own dust limits based on their operational requirements.</p><h3>Pools Sifting</h3><p>Based on the information above we can examine blocks found by pools to see if pools are actively sifting blocks. What we see is 44% of the network is or has sifted for sats in the past year. We have reason to believe that additional pools are in discussions with sifting technology developers in deploying the tech on their pools, but nothing has been made public at this time. Our findings reveal that a very significant percentage of the mining network sees value in sifting for these sats, otherwise this would be a hobbyist endeavor. When this many big players are participating, you know there is some market dynamics happening.</p><figure>

                    <p>Beyond blockchain investigation outlined above, miners are developing new markets of their own in mining irregular transactions for various projects. Most notably is publicluy traded mining pool Marathon who launched a new service called Slipstream which will mine complex transactions such as 1 sat UTXO which is far below the SEGWIT dust threshold of 546 sats. I bring this up because as they are offering this service, you can’t help but assume that Marathon sees or will soon see value in Ordinals of they are willing to invest resources in serving Ordinal or Ordinal adjacent projects with this service. Afterall, the obligation of publicly traded companies is to maximize value for shareholders.</p><p>We know more than 40% of hashrate is sifting for sats, but what does that really mean in the grand scheme of things. Afterall, we are talking about one specific sat, the epic sat in block 840,000. We know that Ordinals have value according to the very small market, we also know that this sat will likely be sold for more than a single blocks reward, but the big question is who could forcibly win this block? Proof of Work is all about the longest chain and ethics don’t matter when it comes to Bitcoin and the blockchain. The chain is truth, even if you were to reorg. If you are hashing and following consensus and you build a longer chain then you are the victor. Based on the table from the previous section, we can see who the top pools are from the past six months. With that information we can model the probability of these pools forking and causing a reorg of the blockchain in order to win the epic sat but we need to run the numbers. For this we will explore the mining section of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. </p><h2>Mining Explained in the Whitepaper</h2><p>Bitcoin mining is a race to find a valid block by solving a cryptographic puzzle, known as proof of work. The difficulty of this puzzle is adjusted by the network so that, on average, a new block is found every 10 minutes, regardless of the total computing power of the network. Now the security of this is where things get interesting. Section 11 of the Bitcoin whitepaper discusses the mathematics behind the security of the blockchain against attackers who try to alter the transaction history. </p><p>The paper uses a comparison to a gambler's "ruin problem" to explain how difficult it is for an attacker to catch up with the rest of the network once they fall behind in the race to add new blocks to the chain. Essentially, if honest nodes control more computational power, the probability that an attacker can catch up decreases rapidly as they fall further behind in the blockchain. The probability that an attacker can catch up becomes almost zero if they do not have a majority of the computational power. </p><p>The section outlines the process where transactions become more secure as new blocks are added to the blockchain, using a Poisson distribution to model the likelihood of an attacker catching up from being behind the chain tip. This framework provides the basis for understanding how blockchain achieves security through probabilistic means not absolute guarantees.</p><p>In the Bitcoin whitepaper, the Poisson distribution is used to model the security of mining. It's used to quantify the probability that an attacker can catch up with the honest nodes after being z blocks behind, which is vital when considering the risk of a blockchain reorganization. It offers a statistical view of how likely it is for an attacker, with a certain percentage of the total network hash rate, to rewrite the blockchain history.</p><figure>

Before Ordinals, the threat of a reorg was focused around a double spend attack, but Ordinals introduced the demand for individual sats, in this case the demand to win a specific block. The question is this, does the value of a single Epic sat or block warrant abandoning the longest chain in hopes of finding a couple quick blocks and winning that epic sat? Pubco mining pools will have a hard time justifying such action to shareholders, it seems negligent. But for private mining pools, they have different incentives and have a bit more freedom in how they pursue revenue.</p><p>Looking at the top 10 mining pools by their percent of the network, we can model out who could pull off a reorg. One thing of note, the formulas described in the whitepaper only model catching up with the chain tip, however a reorg would require catching up to the tip +1 block, so our values below show that probability.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODI4OTYzMjY2NzMzMTI1/table5.png" height="800" width="1018">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The first thing I noticed was Foundry and Antpool have a higher % probability of pulling off a reorg from 1 block behind than their own % hashrate of the network. How could this be possible? This is because A miner with 30% of the hashrate being 1 block behind and attempting a reorg is at a disadvantage because the rest of the network (70% hashrate) collectively has a higher probability of extending the current longest chain before the miner can catch up and surpass it. However, due to the randomness captured by the Poisson distribution, there's always a non-zero probability that this miner could, through a streak of good luck, mine enough blocks in a row to take over the longest chain, even from one block behind. This is statistically unlikely but becomes possible with higher hashrate percentages and short reorg depths.</p><p>The next key takeaway is how successful reorgs become less likely for each block they are behind. It is remarkable how Foundry could still reorg from 5 blocks behind. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Bitcoin space is weird (always has been) and bitcoin miners are the longest of long when it comes to outlook on Bitcoin. Based on the reorg probability and the potential value from the additional value on the first block of the halving, the probability of a reorg feels likely. If you take the BTC mined from this block, the epic sat, plus the projected amount of fees that will be earned from the release of Runes, bigger pools would be foolish to not try and make a move to win this block. The only real downside of a reorg would be by working on the old chain and NOT winning the reorg, so you would miss out on possibly winning 1-2 blocks by mining on the original longest chain. I do hope for fireworks. It will be legendary to hear the talk tracks from the new Wall Street financial bros trying to explain this. At the end of the day, miners will have to make a decision, that is to simply build on the longest chain or to try and build the longest chain with heavy amounts of luck. They must consider the tradeoffs and pick their poisson.</p><p>CODE</p><p>===========REORG-SUCCESS.RB=========================================</p><p># ----</p><p># Data</p><p># ----</p><p>miners = {</p><p> '    foundryusa' => 30,</p><p>    'antpool' => 25.64,</p><p>    'f2pool' => 12.35,</p><p>    'viabtc' => 10.98,</p><p>    'binancepool' => 6.49,</p><p>    'marapool' => 3.78,</p><p>    'luxor' => 2.93,</p><p>    'sbicrypto' => 1.90,</p><p>    'btcdotcom' => 1.54,</p><p>    'braiinspool' => 1.29,</p><p>    'unknown' => 1.27,</p><p>}</p><p># --------</p><p># Equation</p><p># --------</p><p>def attacker_success_probability(q, z)</p><p>    # p = probability honest node finds the next block</p><p>    # q = probability attacker finds the next block</p><p>    # z = number of blocks to catch up</p><p>    p = 1 - q</p><p>    lambda = z * (q / p) # expected number of occurrences in the poisson distribution</p><p>    sum = 1.0</p><p>    for k in 0..z</p><p>    poisson = Math.exp(-lambda) # exp() raises e (natural logarithm) to a number</p><p>    for i in 1..k</p><p>        poisson *= lambda / i</p><p>    end</p><p>    sum -= poisson * (1 - (q/p)**(z-k) )</p><p>    end</p><p>    return sum</p><p>end</p><p># --------</p><p># Results</p><p># --------</p><p># Run through each of the miners in the list</p><p>miners.each do |miner, percentage|</p><p>    # Print miner name</p><p>    puts "#{miner}"</p><p>    # Convert percentage to probability</p><p>    probability = percentage / 100.0</p><p>    # Calculate their success of replacing a different number of blocks near the top of the chain</p><p>    1.upto(5) do |blocks|</p><p>    # NOTE!</p><p>    # Add 1 to the number of blocks.</p><p>    # This is because we don't want to calculate the probability of merely catching up to the tip of the chain (which is what the equation calculates).</p><p>    # To perform a successful attack, we want calculate the probability of building a chain that is ONE BLOCK LONGER than the current chain.

The amount of bitcoin, the frequency it needs to be accessed, and other factors can determine which approach makes the most sense. </p><p>The resources and security requirements of individual bitcoin holders will differ from those of institutions. In this article, we’ll take a look at how the custody strategies for these two groups compare, and then uncover an important truth about the application of multisig.</p><h2>Custody for individuals</h2><p>For typical individuals looking to hold bitcoin in self-custody, there are a number of tools to choose from. Depending on the situation, a simple singlesig wallet could be sufficient, with the option to add modifications such as seed phrase copying or BIP 39 passphrases. We created <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">an article going into detail on various configurations</a>, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>Individuals less concerned with making frequent withdrawals, and looking to secure larger amounts for long-term savings, should consider a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multisig wallet</a>. Multisig offers <em>threshold security</em>, which can protect users from single points of failure, ensuring that no funds are lost if any one component of the setup is destroyed, misplaced, or stolen. Achieving threshold security is crucial for anyone who wishes to protect a substantial amount of funds.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>There are a couple of other methods of threshold security besides multisig, but they are less appropriate for the average person. Shamir’s secret share (SSS) is one method that still leads to temporary single points of failure during the initial setup, and during a withdrawal procedure. Multiparty computation (MPC) is another method which is extremely complicated to safely use. You can learn more about these in <a href="https://unchained.com/features/mpc-vs-multisig-vs-sss/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our article about threshold security models</a>.</p><p>Multisig can be combined with SSS or MPC to create <em>multi-level thresholds</em>. Multi-level thresholds refers to a threshold on the blockchain level (multisig) as well as a threshold on the key level (SSS or MPC). By combining these concepts, a fundamental threshold of keys serves as the primary security for bitcoin holdings, and each key can have protection from becoming compromised by using a threshold of its own. Despite a more complicated structure, two levels of thresholds offers clear advantages for keeping bitcoin maximally secure.</p><p>For a sole individual trying to protect their bitcoin, this approach is widely considered unnecessarily complex. However, if the individual enters a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/diy-vs-collaborative-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">collaborative custody partnership</a> with one or more institutional <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a> capable of deploying SSS or MPC, this increased layer of security becomes more easily accessible.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>Custody for institutions</h2><p>For companies, governments and other institutions who want to secure a bitcoin treasury, it wouldn’t be appropriate to employ some of the custody strategies used by typical individuals. If multiple people are responsible for large sums of money, more rigorous controls are necessary. Institutional-grade bitcoin custody requires threshold security as a bare minimum.</p><p>Multisig, SSS, and MPC are the available choices to meet that requirement. While MPC is by far the most complicated to safely use, and wouldn’t be recommended for individuals, an institution with a team of experts might consider it. However, the extra effort to set up MPC doesn’t mean that it’s a superior option to basic multisig. All three models have trade offs, as discussed in <a href="https://unchained.com/features/mpc-vs-multisig-vs-sss/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our earlier article comparing them</a>.</p><p>If an institution wants the highest level of security possible, they should consider using multi-level thresholds. In this arrangement, the foundation is multisig, which allows for a threshold of multiple separate private keys in order to access funds. Several different <a href="https://unchained.com/private-wealth-and-enterprise">enterprise key agents</a> can be responsible for each key, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-multi-institution-custody/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">minimizing counterparty risk from any single custodian</a>. Additionally, each key agent <em>can apply their own threshold security</em> for the key they are responsible for, by using SSS or MPC. This protects the key from any single officer within the key agent firm.</p><figure>

                    <h2>Multisig has a higher security ceiling</h2><p>As you may have noticed from the charts above, there is a distinct difference between the upper security limits of singlesig and multisig. With singlesig, there is only a single key which can have a threshold applied to it, creating a single-level threshold. Multisig can act as a single-level threshold as well, but also travel a step further: it can be the foundation of multi-level thresholds.</p><p>Therefore, sizable bitcoin holdings that utilize a singlesig foundation rather than a multisig foundation—which can often <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/wealthiest-bitcoin-holders-security/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">be observed by examining the address type</a>—have an opportunity for a security upgrade. Multi-level thresholds can unlock a robust <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-multi-institution-custody/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multi-institution custody structure</a> that distributes risk across key agents.

But there are some statistical conveniences of starting at 50, such as that 50% of all bitcoin to ever be issued are during the first epoch.

Spending countless hours in solitude, meticulously writing the code that would bring the world its first-ever successful attempt at creating a truly decentralized monetary network, the first of which our species has ever had the privilege of experiencing. The pseudonymous creator’s thought process is one we can’t picture - laying out Bitcoin’s framework and ironing out the innovation that is the network’s distributed ledger, the complex mining process that secures it. And then, one of the most fundamental, yet underappreciated, pieces of Satoshi's design was the pre-coded, fixed supply schedule with a 50% reduction in new issuance that happens quadrennially - the Bitcoin halving.</p><p>Hard-coded into Bitcoin’s core, this deflationary event called “the halving”, which enforces the reduction in the supply of the bitcoins being introduced into circulation, is undoubtedly a crucial technical element of the protocol and was a foundational design choice. The creation of a digital currency that would maintain its scarcity and by extension its value, over the long term. A digital currency that would exist beyond the reach of central banking policies and the whims of the hands that control them. That was Satoshi’s idea. And to properly execute this, it had to have a pre-programmed finite supply of 21 million units, with an engineered supply compression mechanism that gradually slows down the rate of issuance of new coins in a four-year cycle. I’m not going to get into too much detail about the Bitcoin halving and its technical aspects, because a lot of brilliant minds have already talked extensively about it, so why reinvent the wheel? Rather, let’s take a few steps back in time.</p><h2>15 YEARS AGO</h2><p>Let's go back a decade and a half, back to those grueling hours Satoshi Nakamoto must have spent working on Bitcoin. Hunched over, working tirelessly on the code, integrating the halving and all it was meant to represent for the network as a mechanism that ensures the long-term scarcity of this new digital currency. Theoretically, he must have known the profound impact the halving would have on the fiat value of Bitcoin. I mean, considering basic economics and how scarcity inversely correlates with value, it couldn’t have been hard to derive that conclusion. However, is it possible that he could have anticipated the significant cultural influence this pre-programmed technical process would take on? </p><p>In those early days, the Bitcoin community was a tiny one, comprising merely thousands globally - a few cypherpunks here and there, coders, and a handful of libertarian idealists tinkering in home offices, basements, and dorm rooms, securing the network while earning those block rewards. Unaware, of course, of the frenzy and excitement that would one day surround each approaching halving. </p><p>And yet, that obscure, humble beginning, was about to birth a cultural phenomenon unlike anything those first few miners nor even Satoshi could have envisioned. With the gradual emergence of Bitcoin into mainstream consciousness over its 15 years of existence, the 4-year hard-coded algorithmic ritual morphed from mere technicalities of a program, into a global celebration - an event that unifies Bitcoiners worldwide, no matter their creed, race, and political ideology and all other superficial ethnocultural and socio-economic classifications we have created - eagerly anticipating, planning parties, that have now come to mark the progression of this monetary revolution. </p><h2>FROM MACRO EVENT TO QUASI-HOLIDAY</h2><p>The once arcane, behind-the-scenes process of miners receiving fewer freshly minted bitcoin, blossomed into a veritable quasi-holiday for Bitcoiners and Cryptography enthusiasts. With its gradual emergence from the fringes, from the darker corners of the internet back in the days when it used to be seen as a tool for hackers, unscrupulous individuals, and bad actors, Bitcoin gained mainstream awareness, enabling the halving to take up a seemingly mystical significance. It became not just a routine supply shock in BTC issuance, but a chance for Bitcoiners around the world to unite in their shared commitment to a monetary protocol that at its foundation, possesses the core principles of decentralization, limited supply, and independence from government manipulation.</p><p>As we approach the 2024 halving - depending on when you’ll be reading this - it has become curiously impossible to ignore the growing cultural significance of this event. Halving countdowns have now become a recurrent element on social media. Bitcoin and Crypto news platforms, as well as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/business/bitcoin-price-surge-halving/index.html">mainstream media outlets</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-04-09/all-eyes-on-bitcoin-s-halving-event-video">other financial news platforms</a>, have published reports about the halving over the past few months. And then there are <a href="https://stacker.news/items/359532">events and parties scheduled throughout April 2024</a>. At these events, Bitcoiners will gather for halving-themed parties and events across the globe - from a "Bit-Rave" festival in San Salvador to themed happy hours in the pubs of Bedford, UK, and even a lakeside gathering in the California desert. There’s even talks of a bitcoin halving festival being held in Calabar, Nigeria. It's a fair bet that there must be a bunch of other such events either already past, or scheduled to hold within the month somewhere in the world.</p><p>Though admittedly not all of them are exactly “halving parties”, but, the fact that they are all scheduled for April when we expect the confirmation of the 840,000th block, tells all. </p><h2>CEMENTING SATOSHI’S VISION FOR SCARCITY AND DECENTRALIZATION</h2><p>As we look ahead towards the 2024 halving considering what it has grown to be these past decade-plus, one question comes to mind; will this quadrennial event continue to hold such profound significance? Bitcoin’s identity seems to have formed its base around the halving. It seems to have been ingrained in such a way that Bitcoin, as we know it today, will not be what it is without the event. That much is clear. It creates a reliable, as well as a predictable cadence for Bitcoiners to gather in a shared celebration of the protocol's core ethos. Each iteration reinforces the network's commitment to true digital scarcity, decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance - the very principles that drew early adopters to this monetary revolution in the first place. The very same principles on which Satoshi’s vision - not the flawed BSV fork though - is based. </p><p>The halving can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy - each supply squeeze is expected to drive up bitcoin’s price, thereby further cementing its place as a store-of-value asset that transcends time. This “prophecy” has enabled analysts, traders, and institutions to develop entire frameworks around the halving’s anticipated impact. Which further emphasizes the point earlier alluded to; that it is ingrained in Bitcoin’s identity. This weaves it into the cultural fabric of the digital currency in a way that transcends its origins as merely a technicality. </p><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>As the 2024 Bitcoin halving approaches, its ever enduring significance may lie in its ability to consistently remind Bitcoiners of the network's unwavering principles. In an era marked by rapid technological shifts and widespread social upheaval, the halving's reliability and unchanging nature provides a sense of stability - a guidepost - so to speak - for this movement. </p><p>The halving serves as a totem, a rallying cry that unites Bitcoiners in their commitment to this monetary revolution, regardless of the fluctuations and disruptions that are unavoidable in the world we live in today. It will remain a quadrennial occurrence that will continue to hold an honored place in Bitcoin culture, reminding us of each passing cycle of the network's unshakable principles and the unstoppable force of Satoshi's infallible creation.</p><p>This event, this beacon of hope in unsettling times, represents an enduring constant, a touchstone that reinforces the immutable foundations upon which the Bitcoin network is built. As the celebrations surrounding the 2024 halving reach a fever pitch once more, we can be certain that this tradition will remain a vital part of the Bitcoin movement, serving as a guidepost for adherents weathering the storms of a rapidly changing technological, social landscape, geopolitical uncertainties, and global economic maelstrom.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Emeka Ugbah</em><em>.

As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same.</p><p>With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/when-is-the-next-bitcoin-halving">April 19</a>, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of <a href="https://www.mara.com/">Marathon Digital Holdings</a>, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn’t appear to be breaking a sweat.</p><p>Why’s that?</p><p>One of the reasons is that Marathon plans to generate alternative streams of revenue utilizing the heat emitted from its bitcoin mining rigs.</p><p>“Bitcoin mining in and of itself does something very efficiently, which is produce heat,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. “50% of industrial energy spend is spent to heat things, so imagine if you could capture the heat from Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin miners could get paid for that. That would subsidize their cost of electricity.”</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unNnCsQi8e8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>During a fireside chat with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) at the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/policymakers-industry-leaders-to-gather-in-washington-dc-for-annual-bitcoin-policy-summit">Bitcoin Policy Summit</a>, held on April 9, 2024 in Washington, DC, Thiel shared an example of how Marathon plans to utilize the heat its miners produce.</p><p>“One of the things we’re doing in Nebraska actually is we’re starting to heat greenhouses and do shrimp farming using the heat from Bitcoin mining as a byproduct,” Thiel explained to Senator Lummis.</p><p>“I think you’re going to start seeing this as a way for people to grow proteins in areas of the disadvantaged world,” he added.</p><p>Utilizing the heat Marathon’s miners produce is one of the ways in which Thiel is looking to change the perception of Bitcoin mining from something that’s parasitic to something that’s productive.</p><p>This dovetails well with the fact that Marathon continues to improve its ability to use waste gas as fuel for its miners.</p><p>Toward the end of 2023, Marathon launched a pilot project in which it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/marathon-digital-holdings-launches-pilot-landfill-methane-powered-bitcoin-mining-project">mined bitcoin with energy derived solely with landfill methane</a>, a gas that’s 80x more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2.</p><p>The project was a success, according to Thiel.</p><p>“It was a proof of concept that showed that you could successfully mine bitcoin using landfill methane gas,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “Mining on landfills is very hard, but we were able to prove that you could do it quite successfully.”</p><p>Thiel expanded on these efforts in his conversation with Senator Lummis, tying together the ideas that Marathon could produce this heat it plans to use while having a positive impact on the environment.</p><p>“You generate energy with that by turning it into methane and then converting that into electricity and you create heat with the electricity,” he told Senator Lummis. “If you can take a waste product, turn it into energy and feed heat back into an industrial process, you do more for the environment than a lot of environmentalists want. And at the same time, your cost to mine bitcoin becomes very small because your energy cost is low.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png"><media:title>bitcoin-mining-rig-fan</media:title><media:text>Serhiy Tron, a former boxer, a persistent entrepreneur and the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine Ukraine, fights for stability in an unstable world.</media:text></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BlackRock Releases Bitcoin Education Series]]></title><description><![CDATA[The worlds largest asset manager continues to market and educate new investors on its spot Bitcoin ETF.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-releases-bitcoin-education-series</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-releases-bitcoin-education-series</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blackrock]]></category><category><![CDATA[SEC]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Etf]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 16:02:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODA1MTUzNTc4NjU3NjYz/mjawotm3mdy0nzczmdaynji2.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a series of educational content aimed at explaining Bitcoin, the Bitcoin halving, and its implications, along with insights into its approved spot Bitcoin ETF.</p><p>"April is packed with rare events this year, with eyes set on the upcoming bitcoin halving - a unique process that only happens every 4 years," said U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, Jay Jacobs.

I will not refer to it as a whitepaper, those are real academic documents for adults. In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. </p><p>The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we’ll have to break down the two pieces involved. </p><h2>The Building Blocks</h2><p>Rijndael’s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate “staging” transaction to withdraw their funds from the vault. This kicks off a timelock, during which they can at any time send their funds back to the vault or a secure cold storage wallet, and after the timelock the user can freely withdraw the funds to the destination they chose when beginning the withdrawal process. These are the <em>only</em> two ways bitcoin sent to the vault script can be spent. </p><p>Explaining the full mechanics of how this is accomplished is essentially an article in itself, so I’m going to do something I usually don’t and hand waive this away as “magic.” (Explained <a href="https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/blog/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-i.html">here</a> by Andrew Poelstra) What this “magic” allows you to do, by creating non-standard Schnorr signatures and with the help of OP_CAT, is to build the transaction the signature check is against on the script stack. This lets you enforce that certain parts of the transaction are exactly as defined ahead of time. It also allows you to put the output from a previous transaction on the stack in the process of building the transaction spending it, meaning you can compare outputs from the spending transaction against outputs from the previous transaction. This allows you to guarantee by comparing them that certain parts of the previous transaction’s outputs match certain parts of the new outputs. I.e. the script, or an amount. So you can “carry forward” parts of the old outputs into the new ones, and enforce that. </p><p>Something else you can do with OP_CAT, which did not need Rijndael tinkering and experimenting with to prove, is verify merkle tree branches. Because you can CAT stack items together, and Bitcoin already supports hashing data on the stack, you can slowly build up a merkle tree root from a leaf node with the interior nodes. Hash two pieces together to get one hash, hash that with the pair hash, and so on. Eventually you get the root hash on the stack. You can then compare it with OP_EQUAL against a predefined root hash in the locking script. </p><h2>Unilateral Withdrawal</h2><p>These two building blocks are enough to facilitate a unilateral withdrawal mechanism from a group shared UTXO. A merkle root can be embedded in a transaction using OP_RETURN or another mechanism that commits to a leaf node for each user. The UTXO script can be structured so that any user with a balance can attempt to withdraw it. To do so they would provide the merkle branch committing to the amount they are entitled to, the authorization proof such as a public key to check a signature against, and construct the transaction on the stack to verify the appropriate conditions are met. </p><p>Similar to Rijndael’s OP_CAT vault, this withdrawal transaction would function as a staging point. User funds would be restricted by a timelock, and they would not be capable of completing the withdrawal until it expires. At any time before the timelock expires, any other user can create a fraud proof to stop the withdrawal and shove funds back into the group UTXO script. They can do this because of OP_CAT’s ability to verify merkle trees. If someone has used a specific merkle branch to withdraw funds from the UTXO before, then that was included in a block somewhere. By constructing a transaction containing the SPV proof of that transaction inside an actual block, which can use OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL to verify the blockheader meets some minimum difficulty, they can prove <em>on the stack</em> that the merkle branch was used before. This allows duplicate withdrawals to be prevented. </p><p>In addition to this, because you can use the “CAT on the stack” trick to ensure specific pieces of a previous transaction must be included in the next, you can guarantee that the current merkle root is carried forward into the next transaction after a successful withdrawal. You can also guarantee that change from the withdrawal goes back into the group sharing script. This guarantees that after one user withdraws their funds, the change UTXO is locked with a script that allows any remaining user to withdraw, and so on. Any user can unilaterally withdraw their funds at any time in any order, with the guarantee that the remainder of funds are still accessible to the rest of the users. </p><h2>The VM Part</h2><p>Readers should be familiar with the basic idea of BitVM. You can take an arbitrary computation and break it up into each of its constituent pieces and embed them in a large taproot tree, turning that computation into a back and forth challenge/response game. This allows you to lock bitcoin with more complicated conditions than is directly supported by bitcoin script itself. The only real shortcoming is the need to craft a massive amount of pre-signed transactions to facilitate this. </p><p>The requirement to use pre-signed transactions is so that in the challenge/response dynamic, you can guarantee that coins are spent back into the large taproot tree encoding it unless an exit condition one way or the other is reached. OP_CAT and the ability to “carry forward” data from previous transactions allows you to guarantee that without needing pre-signed transactions. </p><p>So not only does this scheme allow any user to unilaterally exit on their own, it also allows locking conditions supported by a second layer that are not supported by Bitcoin script to actually be enforced in the withdrawal process. I.e. if some coins were encumbered by a smart contract the base layer doesn’t understand, and then withdrawn from the second layer, those more complicated conditions could still be settled correctly on the base layer as the coins are withdrawn. </p><h2>The Missing Piece</h2><p>One thing that OP_CAT does not enable is updating a merkle tree root representing user balances off-chain verifiably. It can enable an already committed state to facilitate unilateral withdrawals, but that is because a whole section of the tree is actually put on-chain and verified. To update that root off-chain by definition means you are not putting the data on-chain. This represents a problem. There is no way with just CAT to efficiently verify that all changes to the merkle tree were authorized properly by the relevant users. </p><p>Someone(s) has to be trusted, and by the nature of things capable of spending the UTXO however and wherever they want, to efficiently replace an old state root with a new one to represent all off-chain balance changes. A new opcode in addition to OP_CAT, such as OP_ZKVERIFY, would be needed to do this in a trustless manner. </p><p>This wouldn’t be the end of the world without OP_ZKVERIFY though. The entity updating the merkle root for off-chain transfers could be an n-of-n multisig, with 100% of the participants required to sign off on any root changes. This boils down to the same trust model as BitVM based pegs, where as long as a single honest participant exists, no one's funds can be stolen. It is a stark improvement over existing BitVM designs however when it comes to the withdrawal process. </p><p>In BitVM pegs, users do not have a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. Peg operators must be trusted to fulfill user withdrawals, knowing that they can claim back funds they have spent doing so relatively trustlessly from the BitVM peg. While the incentives of this are very solid, it still does require users essentially getting permission from someone else to exit the system, they cannot do it on their own. With CatVM, users can claim back their funds unilaterally, and an operator is not required to front their own liquidity to process withdrawals. </p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Overall, the design is incomplete in terms of construction. This is not something I would call a Layer 2 in and of itself. It is the core of one, the mechanism and structure for how funds are locked into a Layer 2, and the process for how users can withdraw their funds. It definitely has a lot of flexibility and usefulness to it. </p><p>In the worst case scenario, users do not need anyone’s permission to safely claim their funds back on-chain. It also allows more flexible programmability of funds, while still carrying the enforcement of those conditions to the base layer in the event of worst case unilateral exits. If one day we do eventually get something like OP_ZKVERIFY, the off-chain state progression can become an actually trustless process. </p><p>I don’t expect any concrete demos in the near future, but it definitely is a sound idea in my opinion, and something worth considering. It also shows that the wizards are doing a little more than just pumping stupid jpegs. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMzg3MDA0OTIwOTQz/default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1.jpg"><media:title>default_a_glowing_blue_forest_of_digital_merkle_trees_with_a_r_1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breaking Down The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Implications and Predictions for Bitcoin Miners]]></title><description><![CDATA[What lies after Bitcoin’s 4th halving?

This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining.</p><h2>Economic Outlook and Market Predictions</h2><p>After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network. Luxor’s <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/">Hashrate Index</a> Research Team projects about 3-7% of <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-network-hashrate">Bitcoin’s hashrate</a> could go offline if Bitcoin’s price maintains its current level. However, if prices fall, up to 16% of the hashrate could become economically unviable, depending on the trajectory of Bitcoin prices and transaction fees post-halving.</p><p>The hashrate, a critical security measure for Bitcoin, might adjust along with difficulty levels to align with the new economic realities. Luxor’s analysis suggests different scenarios where the network's hashrate could end up ranging from 639 EH/s to 674 EH/s by year's end, reflecting adjustments to the new earning potential post-halving.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>ASIC Pricing and Breakeven Points</h2><p>Post-halving, the profitability of different ASIC models will become crucial as the mining reward drops. Lower rewards mean that only the most efficient machines will be able to operate profitably if the price of Bitcoin does not see a significant increase. For instance, according to Luxor’s projections, next-generation ASICs like the S19 XP and M30S++ might have breakeven power costs ranging from $0.07/kWh to $0.15/kWh, depending on post-Halving <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index">hashprice</a>.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMTUzNDY2MjA2MDc5/image4.png" height="301" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>This shift in profitability will likely lead to a repricing of ASIC machines. Historical data suggests that ASIC prices are highly correlated with hashprice; therefore, the anticipated reduction in hashprice will prompt a downward adjustment in ASIC values. This will particularly impact older and less efficient models, potentially accelerating their phase-out from the market.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>The Role of Custom ASIC Firmware Post-Halving</h2><p>To combat reduced profitability, miners are increasingly turning to custom ASIC firmware to improve the efficiency of their hardware. Firmware like <a href="https://luxor.tech/firmware">LuxOS</a> and BraiinsOS can enhance the performance of machines by optimizing their power usage and hashrate output, thus lowering the breakeven point for electricity costs. For example, underclocking an S19 with custom firmware could extend its operational viability by reducing its power draw, thereby maintaining profitability even at lower hashprices.</p><p>Public miners, in particular, are adopting custom firmware to boost the efficiency of their fleets. Companies like CleanSpark and Marathon have reported using custom solutions to enhance their operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to grow as more miners seek to maximize their output and minimize costs in the face of decreasing block rewards.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>2024 Bitcoin Halving and Beyond</h2><p>The 2024 Bitcoin Halving is set to reshape the mining landscape significantly, just as previous halvings have. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, the event will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities. Miners who plan strategically, taking into account both economic forecasts and operational efficiencies, will be better positioned to navigate the post-halving environment. For those in the Bitcoin mining industry, staying informed and adaptable will be key to leveraging the halving event as an opportunity rather than a setback. With the right preparations, particularly in ASIC management and firmware optimization, miners can continue to thrive even under tightened economic conditions.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by El Sultan Bitcoin.

<p>The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hong-kong-approves-the-first-batch-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-issuer-says">recently approved</a> several fund managers to offer spot bitcoin ETFs. Following this, OSL, a crypto infrastructure provider for some approved fund managers, stated that the bitcoin ETFs are aiming to go live as early as late April.</p><p>Markus Thielen, founder of research firm 10x, also stated that the Bitcoin ETFs could start trading by April 30th. The launch timeline will depend on finalizing details with regulators.</p><p>Once listed, analysts predict the accessible funds could attract significant capital inflows. Singapore-based Matrixport expects mainland Chinese investors to pour up to $25 billion into Hong Kong's <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">Bitcoin ETFs</a> via the Southbound Stock Connect program.</p><p>Thielen echoed this sentiment, stating the ETFs could yield $25 billion if fully accessible to Chinese investors.

Against the backdrop of global discussions on Bitcoin regulation—and coinciding with a solar eclipse—the summit aimed to be a beacon of reason and a catalyst for action in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets.<br><br></p><p>The Bitcoin Policy Summit boasted a remarkable turnout, with more than 45,000 individuals tuning into the livestream. Among the 500+ in-person attendees were representatives from 26 universities, 75 government officials, and 250 public policy professionals. The summit also garnered attention from over a dozen media outlets. Notably, elected leaders from both major political parties were present, alongside representatives from prominent organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Department, Department of Commerce, Treasury Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).<br><br></p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJeFYsk675k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The summit, with its diverse mix of voices and perspectives, shed light on the pressing need for smart and informed decision-making in the realm of digital asset policy. While Bitcoin symbolizes financial freedom and empowerment, it also brings its fair share of challenges, from concerns about money laundering to energy usage. The summit tackled these complex issues head-on, offering insights into the multifaceted world of Bitcoin as it relates to mining, geopolitics, the future of money, and human rights.<br><br></p><p>The Bitcoin Policy Summit witnessed a significant turnout of policymakers committed to safeguarding the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and addressing its associated challenges. Figures such as Senators Marsha Blackburn, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cynthia Lummis, alongside House members Wiley Nickel, Tom Emmer, and Patrick McHenry, lent their expertise and bipartisan support to the discussions. Their active involvement not only enriched the conversation but also signaled a united effort to ensure that digital asset policies foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold transparency and accountability.<br><br></p><p>One of the most striking features of the summit was its focus on the intersection of Bitcoin and human rights, with speakers like Felix Maradiaga, 2024 Nobel Prize Nominee and prominent human rights advocate from Nicaragua; Anna Chekhovich, financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) founded by Alexei Navalny; Roya Mahboob, Afghan entrepreneur and women's rights advocate; and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian human rights activist. Their combined emphasis on Bitcoin’s critical role in defending human rights and freedom of expression in the face of dictators and oppressive regimes shed light on broader roles for digital assets that many in the United States may not have previously considered.<br><br>Furthermore, the summit stressed the importance of taking a global perspective on digital asset regulation to protect human rights. In a world where digital assets know no borders, fragmented regulatory approaches risk creating loopholes and undermining financial integrity. Human rights activists stressed the need to protect privacy, free speech, and equal access to financial services for all, regardless of where they are.<br><br></p><p>The conference hall buzzed with anticipation as attendees dispersed into three specialized rooms for afternoon deep dive tracks: Mining & Energy, Geopolitics, and Future of Money. Concurrent programming featured keynotes such as “A Climate Scientist’s Perspective on Bitcoin” by Margot Paez, BPI fellow and PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. Fireside chats and panels included "Bitcoin & Financial Inclusion" with Chastity Murphy from the U.S. Treasury, and "Countering Digital Authoritarianism" featuring renowned writer Roger Huang, author of ‘Bitcoin and China’, and Jorge Jrsaissati, President of the Organization for Economic Inclusion.<br><br></p><p>One of my personal highlights from the Bitcoin Policy Summit was engaging in a fireside chat with Senator Marsha Blackburn from my home state of Tennessee. We explored the connection between Bitcoin and her advocacy for consumer rights and privacy. Additionally, we discussed Tennessee's growing prominence as a Bitcoin hub and her stance on CBDCs (spoiler: she’s not a fan). It's truly inspiring to witness elected leaders championing both monetary and digital freedoms, reinforcing their commitment to safeguarding these fundamental rights.<br><br></p><p>Another standout moment occurred during a post-summit dinner with Felix Maradiaga and his wife, Berta Valle. Felix, who endured four years of imprisonment under a Nicaraguan dictator, shared firsthand accounts of political dissent and activism. These experiences underscore the importance of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network, providing resilience against oppression.<br><br></p><p>The 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington D.C. served as a crucial platform for educating policymakers and advocating for Bitcoin's role in shaping a freer and more sustainable financial future. Through candid dialogue, diverse perspectives, and collaborative efforts across sectors, participants witnessed the transformative potential of Bitcoin to advance global human rights, bolster national security, and accelerate renewable energy adoption. As we reflect on the insights garnered from the summit, let's seize this pivotal moment to shape a regulatory landscape that not only fosters innovation and economic growth but also champions human dignity, justice, and liberty.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Stephen Pollock.

While skeptics were quick to mock bitcoin’s near instantaneous selloff in reaction to the news of conflict, ironically bitcoin was one of the only global asset open for trading on the weekend, with equities, commodities, and bond strategists alike turning their eyes to the bitcoin chart in an attempt to assess what the damage might be to global markets upon the Sunday night trading open. </p><p>Turning away from geopolitics, this brief article will take a look at the latest in on-chain spending behavior and Bitcoin derivative markets, to analyze whether the current dip from the highs of $73,000 is typical of a standard bull market correction or more so a cyclical peak.</p><p>Many preconceived notions of a typical Bitcoin cycle have already been shattered with new highs being broken before the upcoming halving taking place on block 840,000. So let's evaluate and take a look at where we are, and how these conditions and investor behavior also inform what might come next.</p><p>We’ll be looking at both on-chain data, to analyze the actions of incumbent Bitcoin hodlers and new market entrants alike, before taking a look at the derivatives market to gauge whether there is anything worrisome in regards to the leverage currently present in the market.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>First, we’ll take a look at a metric called the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, coined and created by <a href="https://twitter.com/TXMCtrades">TXMC</a>, which compares near-term spending behavior to the yearly average, as a means of detecting overheated and undervalued markets. A brief look at this signals that the bull market is well underway, and may have even peaked.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MTE0MTU5/image2.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        <figcaption><em>The exact calculation of the metric, for those curious, is the ratio of two daily moving averages (30, 365) of Value Days Destroyed (Coin Days Destroyed * Price), then adjusted for supply inflation to account for changes in spender behavior over time.</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>We can attribute approximately one third of the spending as a simple transfer of coins from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to new ETF participants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. However, the raw data is just that—the raw data, and we can see there has been a significant amount of spending that’s occurred with the push to new highs.</p><p>A closer look at the metric, however, shows that this spending activity is cooling off, and there is historical precedent for new highs in the market in both the 2017 and 2021 cycle - this is merely a data point to keep in mind.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MjQ1MjMx/image5.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Next, taking a look at the interplay between HODLers and new entrants, viewed through the lens of short-term and long-term holders, we can see that during a typical bull market, revisits to the cost basis of short-term holders are not only typical but also quite healthy. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MTE0OTQz/image6.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Additionally, the ability for this approximate price level to serve as support is a characteristic of bull markets, with the inverse being true in a bear market, where this psychological level of average short-term holder price (cost basis) often serves as ironclad psychological and technical resistance. As for where that level is today, approximately $58,500, which means that by no means is a visit to this level a guarantee or certainty, but rather it is something that is perfectly in the norm of expected activity in a bull market.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MDQ5NDA3/image3.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Turning our attention to the derivatives market, there has been a healthy flush of leverage and speculative froth across the market. Perpetual futures open in bitcoin terms are near the lowest levels seen since 2022, while futures have been trading at a slight discount to spot markets since the weekend flush lower. While there is no law or guarantee that this brings about higher prices immediately, similar positioning in the past has fostered the conditions for price appreciation, and when compared to the top-heavy speculative froth of a speculative premium in futures market pricing observed over the last month or so, it is a welcomed development. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MzEwNzY3/image7.png" height="800" width="1146">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>In terms of points of interest when eyeing the derivatives landscape, the buildup of liquidatable leverage above $70,000 continues to grow, with emboldened shorts looking to push price meaningfully below $60,000. While there is some leverage to be purged under the $60,000 level, the real prize for bears is under the $50,000 level. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyNjIzMzA2MTc5Njk1/image4.png" height="800" width="1017">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>While certainly crazier things have happened in Bitcoin than a -33% pullback from all-time highs, spot demand is likely to be strong from $50,000, and a wipe of open interest and the start of a negative futures premium relative to spot markets hint at most of the pullback having already taken place. It would likely take a significant risk-off moment across the macro landscape for this to unfold, and any dip is likely to be fleeting given the perpetuating reality of the pace of fiscal deficit spending.</p><p>Conclusion: This bull market has legs, and the current pullback from the highs, along with any future dips in the exchange rate, should be a welcomed development for investors with a sufficiently long time horizon who understand where this is all headed. Bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to improve, and pullbacks serve to purge leverage and weak handed speculators during secular bull markets. </p><figure>

He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute.</p><p>Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you don’t have to disclose your identity to do so, not to mention the process of buying a voucher is quick and easy. Azteco offers both on-chain and Lightning capabilities, giving users the choice to redeem their BTC on either the Bitcoin base chain or the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a>, a Layer 2 payments network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>According to an estimate from Fernandez, over one million people have already purchased Azteco vouchers. But his aspirations are far beyond the already-impressive number of vouchers thus sold: he has his sights set on Azteco servicing a customer base of over 30 times that, as Azteco does its part in “normalizing” Bitcoin.</p><p><em>A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below.</em></p><p><strong>Frank Corva:</strong> Where did the inspiration for Azteco come from?</p><p><strong>Akin Fernandez:</strong> It came from my own experience of finding out that getting bitcoin is very difficult. I realized it doesn't have to be like this. We could use a familiar system like a top-up voucher, which billions of people use to top up their mobile phones, and apply that process to getting bitcoin. All we have to do is build a software, put distribution in place, and then it should just work. And lo and behold, it does.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Did you have a particular customer base in mind when you designed Azteco?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Yes, I had myself in mind. I wanted to be able to get bitcoin without having to make any kind of fuss or effort to do it. I wanted to be able to go to the supermarket, buy $20 worth of bitcoin and put it straight onto my wallet. And I'm not unique. I could assume that there were other people who were like me who could understand the proposition and the ease of use and who would take to it like a duck to water.</p><p>You find that with inventions, many times they come about because people are solving problems for themselves, not as a means to get rich or for any reason other than to solve their own problems. And because people are similar, they solve other people's problems, too.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Speaking of your own experience. I’ve read that you were unbanked for a period of time. Is this true and could you expand on it, if so?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Well, I became unbanked for a reason that I, until this day, don't know. I went down to “my” bank to cash a check, and they couldn't find my account in the system. I had received no communication from them in writing or in any way. All of a sudden, I had no bank account. So, for many years after that I didn't have access to credit cards or anything that other people in the West take for granted.</p><p>This taught me a very, very big lesson about how difficult it is to do anything in the 21st century if you don't have access to banking facilities. You can forget shopping online. You can forget any kind of convenience of going into a store and paying with a card. All of that goes away. </p><p>So, when I was working on Azteco, it was made clear to me how powerful a tool it was going to be, because, with Bitcoin, you cannot be unbanked by any third party. You have control over your synthetic money.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I’ve heard you use this term “synthetic money” before, and you’ve discussed how we shouldn’t refer to bitcoin as actual money. Why is it important that we do this?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> It's important because it's true. Bitcoin is not money — it's a database. Can it be used as money? Of course. It can be used as very, very good money. It's a good simulation of money. But it doesn't have to be money for it to be useful.</p><p>Also, if you call bitcoin money, all the regulations that the state has imposed on actual money can be superimposed or brushed over Bitcoin inappropriately, making it hard to use and slower to spread. So, it's very important to tell the truth about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has taken so long to get into every nook and cranny because there's been this misconstruing of it as money.</p><p>WhatsApp reached a billion people in four and a half years. That's the kind of spread into people's phones that we'd expect if the rails to get onto Bitcoin were frictionless, just like they are with WhatsApp.</p><p>The fact that Bitcoin has not reached that number of people indicates that there's something wrong in the way people are thinking about it, and so it's important for us to think about it correctly.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> How many people is Azteco reaching? Put another way, how many vouchers did Azteco sell in Q3 or Q4 of 2023?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> The actual numbers I don't have at hand being the CEO and not the CFO. But we had our biggest ever month last month. I was told this yesterday. The number of vouchers we're selling is increasing, and this is a direct result of our increasing our distribution and also the sentiment towards Bitcoin changing on a global scale.</p><p>We're the easiest way to get bitcoin. When people discover us, they say two things: “First of all, why isn't everything as easy as this?” and “How come I haven't heard of this before?”</p><p>Things are synergizing and coming together to bring us to a point where we're a global force for good and for getting Bitcoin to the people who need it the most — the unbanked and the people who don't have access to financial rails or people who just don't want to be the victims of the financial rails. </p><p>The old school crop of Bitcoin businesses that have been serving people over the last 10 years all believe that Bitcoin is money and make it very difficult to get an account. Everybody's so inured to the idea of having a bank account or an account of any kind, whether it's through email or anything else. The assumption immediately is, “Well, of course, I have to have an account in order to use this service.”</p><p>With Bitcoin, that's not true, though. No accounts are necessary. [Some] wallet companies are doing this correctly. One of them is Samourai Wallet and another is Wallet of Satoshi where you don’t need to open an account to use your own money.</p><p>They’re saying you shouldn’t be able to use bitcoin without having an account. That’s what they’re trying to do in the EU.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> We’re doing it here in the US with the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Crypto%20AML%20One-Pager_7.26.23.pdf">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA)</a>, too, the bill that Elizabeth Warren drafted.</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> These people are oath breakers. They’ve sworn an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution, which guarantees the free speech of every single American. Bitcoin is speech. It's a database where speech is written down and stored and transmitted from one person to another.</p><p>And lest anyone think that I'm picking on the Democrats and not the Republicans, Cynthia Lummis has written an absolutely appalling <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2281/text">bill</a> that I took great pleasure in <a href="https://medium.com/@beautyon_/unpacking-the-lummis-gillibrand-responsible-financial-innovation-act-6128e6db6a68">tearing to pieces on my blog</a>.</p><p>They don’t understand what their role is as a public servant. A servant is not in control of its masters. A servant is obedient to the electorate. It’s not their business to tell people you have to KYC to use bitcoin.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> On the topic of America and KYC-free bitcoin, do you see people using Azteco because they want KYC-free bitcoin?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> In order for the American market to be cracked, the service has to be explained. People have to be deprogrammed. They don’t understand that bitcoin is not a vehicle to make you earn more fiat.</p><p>People need to be broken out of these bad habits to be shown that actually there are better ways to get things done. The perfect example of this is WhatsApp.</p><p>Before WhatsApp, people used to pay for SMS messages, while the idea of this is now unthinkable. A similar process has to happen with Bitcoin where you can send money to family members without having to go through a third party or pay exorbitant fees or identify yourself or anything like that.</p><p>With Bitcoin, you [also] get other subtle benefits. Hyperinflation is starting to kick in and people are starting to realize that there’s something wrong with the money.</p><p>People find it very difficult to go to the root cause of the prices going up at McDonalds. Let’s say they did find out the cause, what could they do about it? They could go and get bitcoin, but it’s several steps down before these people are going to see bitcoin as the answer.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> I agree.</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Also, the current crop of businesses — big businesses like Binance, Coinbase — are synonymous with bitcoin. Azteco needs to be synonymous with getting bitcoin. The vast majority of people on earth are not rich. They don't have $100,000 to spend on bitcoin. They live day to day.</p><p>Since these people are not investors and they don't have spare money to keep in bitcoin in the hopes that it's going to go up — which of course it will — they need to have bitcoin as daily money for everyday spending.</p><p>Once you start talking about these things, the business opportunities and models start to just fall out of the conversation. All of these Cynthia Lummises and Elizabeth Warrens prevent these business models from emerging because they're regulating something they have no business regulating.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Speaking of other businesses, I’ve heard you say good things about <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-machankura-spread-bitcoin-through-africa-feature-phones">Machankura</a>, a protocol that makes it easier for Africans to use bitcoin in a KYC manner, and that it serves as a compliment to Azteco. What other companies in the Bitcoin space are a compliment to Azteco?</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> Ethical Bitcoin wallets are a good compliment. By ethical, I mean Samourai Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi. I know that some people don’t like Wallet of Satoshi because the architecture on the backend is not to their liking, but these people don’t run businesses — they don’t know how difficult it is to do these things.</p><p>The newest entrant to this is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-releases-bitkey-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-for-pre-order">Bitkey wallet</a>. This Bitkey wallet is absolutely unbelievable. They've thought about this properly. The user interface and user experience — it's going to make everybody change their game.</p><p>I've been saying for a long time that somebody like Apple, Microsoft or some other company is going to get into Bitcoin and bring all of that user experience thinking to the process of using Bitcoin. The current crop of companies have not thought about user experience.</p><p>Jack Dorsey’s Bitkey has been a kick in the backside to a lot of people who realize that we can't just carry on doing what we want to do and expecting people to just accept it — the idea that you have to write down your mnemonic before you receive your first transaction. It’s completely crazy.</p><p>If Apple developed its own Bitcoin wallet or clones one of the Bitcoin wallets out there, Bitcoin is going to be exposed to people in a way that's very easy to understand, very easy to consume. There will be the new generation of Bitcoin users for whom Bitcoin is totally normal — not threatening, intimidating or frightening.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> The same way that using WhatsApp or Uber is normal now…</p><p><strong>Fernandez:</strong> That's exactly right. Bitcoin has to become boring.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg1NDIyNzY3MzM0NTEx/azteco_article_preview-v2.jpg"><media:title>azteco_article_preview-v2</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Weekly Reorg: Bitcoin Fashion Week]]></title><description><![CDATA[In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week</guid><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Layer 2]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Bergeron]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 19:13:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week. </p><p>Amongst other things, <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1777771133233742177">Mezo</a>, a “Bitcoin economic layer” came out of stealth with a $21 million fundraising round. <a href="https://twitter.com/AlpenLabs/status/1778080721128599949">Alpen Labs</a> announced a $10.6 million bankroll to bootstrap a Bitcoin-native zero-knowledge infrastructure. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTQ5Nzg0MDYxMDM5/screen-shot-2024-04-16-at-25053-pm.png" height="800" width="990">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Another posse of blockchain designers, including the folks at Starkware, got together and launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/L2Ordinals/status/1778453840775553485">L2O Consortium</a> “to set standards for trustless applications and Layer 2s.”<br><br>Of course, nobody knows what this all means, but it’s provocative. It gets the people going, the capital frothing, and the industry buzzing. Eight-figure seed rounds are getting thrown around and some pretty major venture players are making a comeback. Almost every day, a new layer is announced or some “Bitcoin-native” protocol you’ve never heard about announces that its users have locked a bazillion dollars worth of bitcoins into their “trustless” multi-sig protocol. </p><p>So it goes in a bull market, I guess. Curiously, some of the people involved will admit it feels more like performance art than legitimate engineering. Remember the <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1778823151629054147">Rick Owens</a> freak runway shows? It’s flashy alright but who’s going to wear this stuff? </p><p>Keep in mind most of the new gadgets being proposed have yet to take off their training wheels anywhere they’ve been implemented. Rollups on Ethereum, for example, are still just <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1772796987806450121">dressed-up multi-sig</a>. Similarly, this new crop of Bitcoin-adjacent protocol seems content launching with either no product or “decentralization on the roadmap.” Under the layers of vapid marketing and technical mumbo jumbo, it’s hard to find a trust model that is much better than the simple and often maligned Liquid federated sidechain. </p><p>Forget unilateral exit, most of the “Layer 2s” on offer today can hardly qualify for the term under our admittedly loose <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/press-releases/bitcoin-magazine-editorial-policy-on-bitcoin-layer-2s-l2s">policy</a> here at Bitcoin Magazine. </p><p>To make matters worse, variants of proof-of-stake have crept into the design space despite Ethereum’s abysmal performance since its transition. Not surprisingly, the conversation has already devolved into <a href="https://twitter.com/build_on_bob/status/1773010071917642182">ponzinomics</a> to bootstrap the speculative flywheel. Colloquially styled “points,” a new token contraption has burst onto the scene and is all the rage amongst the designer crowd. This new liquidity farming fad requires users to deposit their bitcoins (and those of <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1777876863832191404">friends and family</a>) somewhere in exchange for, you guessed it, yield. </p><p>They’re calling it gamification this time around. I think it’s peak crypto nihilism. Fast fashion has officially made it into Bitcoin!</p><h2>The Emperor Has No Clothes?</h2><p>Speaking of catwalks and clownishly dressed individuals, the crew at Taproot Wizards recently <a href="https://medium.com/@twhittle/bitvm-bridges-considered-unsafe-9e1ce75c8176#:~:text=The%20core%20issue%20with%20BitVM,the%20validators%20burn%20the%20bridge.">unleashed pandemonium</a> on the aspiring Layer 2 community by going at its most prized science project, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitvm-2-opening-up-the-playing-field">BitVM</a>. </p><p>My esteemed colleague Shinobi put together a decent <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitvm-liquidity-crunch-issue">recap</a> of the event. I wont bother you with the technical details but, of course, the claims remain hotly contested to this day. At least a dozen new companies’ fate hangs in the balance here so you can imagine the smell when they were publicly outed to the fashion police. </p><p>Although I’m partial to the wizards’ arguments, we should probably hold off on writing the obituary for BitVM. Jumping through liquidity hoops appears to be one of the pervasive tradeoffs one has to make when designing trust-minimized protocols on top of Bitcoin. Lightning has given us inbound liquidity headaches for years. Proposals like Ark have been dismissed because of the massive UTXOs operators have to fund. Maybe BitVM bridges can be designed to mitigate the upfront liquidity requirements of operators. At least, the issue is probably not enough for everyone to drop everything and go home.</p><p>The unfortunate takeaway from this saga is that everyone involved comes away looking a bit amateurish. Despite <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1776563645738000745">claims to the contrary</a>, some due diligence was clearly skipped. The issue could’ve been run through a bit more collective brain cells before publishing and you can tell the targets all felt pretty blindsided by the announcement.<br></p><p>To tie this all up, the wizards have just come out with their <a href="https://twitter.com/QuantumCatsXYZ/status/1779968142279573583">derivative</a> proposal. It’s hard not to get the impression that this was a bit of a setup motivated by marketing purposes. Then again, they’re grown men wearing wizard hats, what do you expect?<br><br>On the other hand, it is a valid issue and the response from “team” BitVM hasn’t been exactly gracious either. You’d expect thicker skin from researchers who have been around the block. Banning people from a Telegram working group and hand-waving away the entire premise does not serve the interest of the community they are building for. They can disagree with the conclusions but the obvious outcome is that the audience and interest in BitVM have now grown beyond the small engineering circles where it was fomenting. Many have suggested it was probably the first time the mechanism was communicated in an accessible way. It was a missed opportunity for its advocates to leverage this attention and steer it their way if they thought the project was misrepresented. </p><p>Hopefully, this is all just a failed dress rehearsal because I don’t see how this is very inspiring for anyone seriously interested in contributing to this space. <br></p><h2>A grand finale</h2><p>Of course, a circus show isn’t complete without the clown act.</p><p>The hottest protocol designer in town is preparing to showcase his latest line just in time for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-turning-point-counting-down-to-the-most-important-halving-in-history">halving</a> this Friday. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/runes-an-attempt-at-a-serious-protocol-or-another-childrens-toy">Runes</a>, a protocol for fungible tokens, is probably the most anticipated drop since the Jordan 1s. As we speak, <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1775483586885423423">hundreds of users</a> are syncing up Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives in preparation for the festivities. The blockchain is expecting a record crowd for this event so be advised that tickets could get expensive. </p><p>As for myself, I’ll probably just watch from my balcony in the comfort of my safe and ever-reliable Bitcoin jeans.

Its impact is most profound in developing countries, where access to banking still poses a challenge for many. </p><p>Here, Bitcoin serves as more than a currency or an investment; it's a means to engage in essential financial activities, such as sending and receiving money, that would otherwise be out of reach. </p><p>Forget, at least for a minute, the speculative potential in terms of financial gain—the true value of Bitcoin lies in its potential to level the financial playing field, offering access to financial tools that were previously exclusive to those with more established economic backgrounds. </p><p>Amid its fluctuating value, the enduring promise of Bitcoin is its contribution to financial inclusivity, making it a beacon of hope for more equitable access to financial services worldwide.</p><h2>Historical context of Bitcoin and financial inclusivity</h2><p>Bitcoin was born out of the financial turmoil of the late 2000s, with its creator(s) aiming to forge a decentralized currency that could bypass traditional banking systems and help society at large traverse a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. </p><p>This vision was not just technical but deeply ideological, seeking to empower individuals with financial autonomy. </p><p>At its core, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/financial-inclusion/2024/will-2024-see-crypto-make-good-on-its-financial-inclusion-promise/">Bitcoin promised to make financial services accessible</a> to anyone with internet access, regardless of their standing with conventional financial institutions.</p><p>This promise has seen tangible realization in countries like Nigeria, where traditional banking services are out of reach for many. In Nigeria, <a href="https://tokenist.com/nigeria-approves-policy-to-build-a-blockchain-powered-economy/">Bitcoin has become more than a speculative asset</a>—for instance, with the country's significant diaspora, Bitcoin facilitates remittances, enabling Nigerians living abroad to send money home more efficiently and at lower costs compared to traditional banking services. </p><p>In Argentina, Bitcoin has emerged as a crucial financial tool <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin">amidst the country's ongoing economic challenges</a>, including high inflation rates and currency devaluation. For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers a more stable store of value compared to the national currency, the Argentine peso, <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">which has suffered from significant depreciation</a> over the years. </p><p>A similar trend can be noticed in Ghana, where the annual inflation rate is <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghana-s-inflation-slows-but-central-bank-to-remain-cautious-1.2046167">predicted to land in the 13% to 17% range</a> in 2024.</p><p>In Venezuela, a country <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/despite-utility-bitcoin-cannot-fix-venezuela">grappling with political instability and economic crises</a>, Bitcoin has found a unique role beyond just a means of preserving wealth against hyperinflation. Here, Bitcoin is being utilized to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/10/a-rare-glimpse-into-how-crypto-is-really-used-in-venezuela/">support microfinance initiatives and charitable donations</a>, directly impacting the lives of those in need. Organizations and platforms leveraging cryptocurrency can bypass traditional financial systems, which are often inaccessible or unreliable for the country's impoverished populations, to provide direct financial assistance.</p><p>Moreover, for entrepreneurs and small business owners the world over, it offers a means to engage in international transactions without the need for bank accounts or the risk of currency devaluation. It’s both a hedge against crisis and a vessel of freedom against authoritarian regimes, but the decentralization schtick isn’t </p><h2>The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest</h2><p>By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing the digital currency, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-etf-a-decade-of-struggle-for-legitimacy">BTC ETFs offer a familiar, regulated avenue</a> for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin space.</p><p>Previously, the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin deterred many institutional investors. However, with the advent of ETFs and other regulated investment products, these entities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/institutional-investors-may-help-bitcoin-sustain-new-heights-2024-03-05/">can now participate in the cryptocurrency market</a>, bringing with them substantial capital inflows and increased legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, which will only increase with further adoption.</p><p>This institutional foray into Bitcoin has a dual impact. </p><p>On one hand, it introduces a level of stability and liquidity previously unseen, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. </p><p>On the other, it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/will-bitcoin-transform-into-just-another-stock-amidst-institutional-surge-and-etf-integration-">represents a shift from Bitcoin's original ethos</a> of decentralization and democratization of finance. </p><p>Another point to consider is that institutional interest isn’t limited to private, for-profit enterprises—with countries like El Salvador, which recently <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-moves-bitcoin-reserves-to-cold-storage-vault">took custody of its national Bitcoin treasury</a> showcasing that, slowly but surely, the general attitude of governments towards cryptocurrencies is also changing with the times.</p><h2>Potential impacts of institutionalization on accessibility</h2><p>On the one hand, these developments can enhance Bitcoin's appeal by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/stabilizing-forces-how-bitcoin-etf-inflows-counter-price-volatility">contributing to market stability and reducing volatility</a>—a key concern that has deterred a broader demographic from embracing cryptocurrencies. </p><p>The entry of institutional investors can also increase liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially making it a more reliable asset for individuals and businesses worldwide.</p><p>However, the flip side of institutionalization is the potential increase in barriers to entry for marginalized groups. </p><p>The very essence of Bitcoin's appeal to these groups <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-bitcoin-improves-financial-access-and-inclusion-2021-06-21">is its accessibility</a>: the ability to participate in the financial system with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection. As regulatory frameworks become more stringent and the market more institutionalized, the processes for acquiring and using Bitcoin could become more complex. </p><p>Requirements such as rigorous identity verification and compliance with financial regulations, while necessary for fraud prevention and financial security, could inadvertently sideline those without formal identification or those living in regions with less regulatory clarity.</p><p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2023e3.htm">the shift towards institutionalization </a>might lead to a concentration of wealth and power within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reminiscent of traditional financial systems. </p><p>This concentration could undermine the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, making it less about empowering the individual and more about serving institutional interests. </p><p>The challenge lies in finding a balance: leveraging institutional interest to bring stability and legitimacy to Bitcoin while ensuring that its revolutionary promise of financial inclusivity remains intact.</p><h2>Financial inclusion and cryptocurrency adoption</h2><p>Sub-Saharan Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167624523000495">with its blend of limited banking infrastructure and high mobile penetration</a>, has emerged as a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. The region, marked by its smaller overall market size in terms of traditional financial metrics, shows a significantly high level of grassroots cryptocurrency usage. </p><p>Nigeria, for example, not only ranks second on the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Global Crypto Adoption Index</a> but also leads Sub-Saharan Africa in raw transaction volume, as well as the world in P2P exchange trade volume ranking. Other countries like Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa also feature prominently on the index, underlining the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial instruments​</p><p>The adoption is driven largely by practical necessities rather than speculative interests, with cryptocurrencies serving as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. </p><p>In Ghana, where <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/ghana-inflation-hits-record-54-1-as-food-costs-surge">inflation surged to its highest level in two decades</a> at the tail end of 2022, and in other nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa facing similar economic challenges, cryptocurrencies have become an attractive means of preserving wealth. The shift towards digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, and more recently, stablecoins, reflects a broader search for financial stability and freedom​</p><p>Peer-to-peer transactions, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/sub-saharan-africa-a-major-potential-revenue-opportunity-for-digital-payments">especially prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, account for a significant portion of crypto transactions, underscoring the region's unique position in the global crypto landscape. This high rate of P2P transactions is attributed to the everyday use of crypto for retail payments, remittances, and commercial transactions. </p><p>The preference for crypto over traditional banking and financial services is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity in regions where local currencies are losing value, as seen in countries like Nigeria and Kenya​</p><p>Through bypassing traditional financial barriers, cryptocurrencies offer expanded finance options to underserved markets, exemplified by initiatives like <a href="https://empowa.io/">Empowa</a> and <a href="https://pezesha.com/">Pezesha</a> in Mozambique and Kenya that utilize blockchain to facilitate real estate development and connect MSMEs with global lenders.</p><h2>Balancing institutional interest and financial inclusivity</h2><p>As Bitcoin continues to navigate the waters between grassroots empowerment and institutional adoption, its future landscape presents a dichotomy. </p><p>On one side, increased institutional interest brings stability and credibility, potentially making Bitcoin a more viable and trusted financial asset globally. </p><p>On the other, this shift could challenge the very inclusivity that has been a cornerstone of Bitcoin's appeal, particularly among minority groups and in regions with limited access to traditional banking services.</p><p>To ensure that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-advocate-najah-roberts-explains-why-btc-is-a-tool-for-empowerment">Bitcoin remains a tool for empowerment</a>, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential pathway is the development of regulatory frameworks that encourage inclusivity. </p><p>Regulations could be designed to protect consumers <a href="https://fintech.global/globalregtechsummit/crypto-regulation-shouldnt-kill-innovation-but-it-is-needed/">without stifling innovation</a> or access to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the continued support and promotion of peer-to-peer platforms can empower individuals by facilitating direct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As Bitcoin evolves amidst rising institutional interest, its foundational role as an agent of financial inclusivity faces both challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that Bitcoin continues to serve marginalized communities requires a delicate balance, blending the stability brought by institutional involvement with its potential as a democratizing force. </p><p>One thing is certain—the future of Bitcoin hinges in large part on maintaining its essence as a lifeline for financial empowerment across the globe.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

For as long as humans have been organizing into social groups, we’ve been hating on the group in the next valley. Even though we have much more in common with them than we would care to admit.</p><p>It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>These differences aren’t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can’t even recall why they disliked one another in the first place.</p><p>But it wasn’t always that way: and it doesn’t have to stay this way. There are signs that the rivalry that has polarized bitcoiners and ethereans is starting to thaw. If these frenemies can bury the hatchet and work together, it will make web3 a better place for everyone.</p><h3>From Divergence to Convergence</h3><p>It’s easy to forget that Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin cut his teeth at Bitcoin Magazine and was a regular poster on the Bitcointalk forum. When the Ethereum ICO was <a href="https://coincodex.com/ico/ethereum/">held</a> in 2014, funds were raised at a ratio of 2,000 ETH per BTC. It’s also easy to forget that many of the use cases now synonymous with Ethereum have Bitcoin ancestors, such as NFT precursor Colored Coins. Even the concept of a Layer 2 has Bitcoin beginnings. But all that’s ancient history now.</p><p>BTC has assumed the mantle of store of value and global reserve currency, while ETH has become the fuel that launched 100 EVM chains and 10,000 tokens. Along the way, the continental drift pushing the two ecosystems apart has been expedited by Ethereum’s move to Proof of Stake, leaving Bitcoin as the only top 20 coin aside from DOGE still wedded to Proof of Work.</p><p>While the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are stark, they are not irreconcilable. One of the most fascinating aspects of the chains’ evolving use cases is the way in which each has emulated the other. Ethereum is well on its way to becoming a somewhat stable store of value of its own, and looks poised to follow Bitcoin in receiving an ETF.</p><p>Bitcoin, meanwhile, has belatedly spawned its own multi-chain and multi-token ecosystem thanks to Ordinals, BRC20, Runes, Stacks, and similar protocols. Bitcoin-native DeFi and NFTs are now a thing – even if most maximalists aren’t on board. While it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin DeFi takes off, it’s clear that there’s now more that unites the two chains than divides them. Bitcoin and Ethereum have moved in opposing directions over the years but their paths are finally starting to converge.</p><h3>Choose Tech, Not Tribalism</h3><p>Rather than arguing over whose tech trumps whose, or who implemented it first, there are clear benefits to the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities setting aside their differences. Just as globalism diminished petty tribalism (even if we simply swapped hating the guy in the next valley for hating internet strangers), the multi-chain era has rendered blockchain wars pointless.</p><p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer isolated islands but interconnected hubs that routinely exchange value through bridges, portals, and wrappers. Isn’t it time they started swapping developer talent too? The onus is on builders to find ways that both technology stacks can enhance one another. This is the key to scaling web3 and growing adoption.</p><p>The rise of Ordinals has shown there is strong interest in utilizing the Bitcoin network as more than simply a means to store value. But building out further utility natively is complex since the network is not Turing complete by nature and its simplistic UTXO model and limited block space cannot handle complex data and calculations.</p><p>While there have been many avenues explored for scaling Bitcoin, they all relied on a level of centralization until the Taproot upgrade which brought Schnorr Signature and MAST contracts. These upgrades have made it possible to design fully trustless bridges between the Bitcoin ecosystem and other networks, allowing for truly decentralized scaling solutions to be realized.</p><p>The Ethereum ecosystem is already home to a robust suite of tools, smart contracts and applications that can be utilized to bring further compatibility and functionality to Bitcoin. It makes far more sense for Bitcoin to inherit the technology that already exists for certain functions rather than rebuild them from the ground up.</p><h3>Scale Bitcoin, Enhance Ethereum</h3><p>An obvious solution to scaling Bitcoin at the consumer level and building out new use cases is to utilize the functionality enabled by Taproot to create trustless bridges between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks. This can create a wave of new opportunities for both ecosystems by unlocking new ways for Bitcoin holders to engage while increasing the liquidity within Ethereum-based chains.</p><p>While the possibility of utilizing EVM-compatible technology to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem is promising, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome will not be technological but cultural. While human ingenuity is boundless, our tendency to drag one another down like a bucket of crabs remains deeply ingrained.</p><p>All crypto communities should strive to shun the cutthroat behaviors web2 was built on and find ways to collaborate. Only once this is done can web3 realize its full potential. As Biggie put it, “Can’t we just all get along?”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Yves La Rose.

It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology.</p><p>Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T’s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks.</p><p>The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity.</p><p>But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation— it’s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph.</p><p>This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed—and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future.</p><h3>Outline</h3><p><strong>I. </strong>Decentralized systems are markets<br><strong>II. </strong>Decentralized markets require decentralized goods<br><strong>III. </strong>How can decentralized systems price computations?<br><strong>IV.</strong> Satoshi’s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin<br><strong>V. </strong>Conclusion</p><p>A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai’s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts “from exactly that point.” In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin. </p><figure>

                    <h3>How did Satoshi think of bitcoin?</h3><p>Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn’t come out of nowhere.<br></p><p>Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented:</p><ul><li>Digital currencies should be P2P networks</li><li>Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation</li><li>Money is created through an auction</li><li>Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins</li><li>Transactions are batched into blocks</li><li>Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work</li><li>All blocks are stored by all participants<br></li></ul><p>Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn’t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi’s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list.</p><p>Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place?<br></p><p>This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi’s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money.</p><h3>I. Decentralized systems are markets </h3><p>Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words “decentralized” and “distributed” are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces.<br></p><figure>

                    <p>For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">topology of their network diagrams,</a> but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets.</p><h3>Distributed systems rely upon central authorities</h3><p>In this work, we take “distributed” to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as “nodes”) which must communicate, typically over a network.</p><p>Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems.</p><p>But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system.</p><p>Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes.</p><p>The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system.</p><p>Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required.</p><p>In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system.</p><h3>Decentralized systems have no central authorities </h3><p>We take “decentralized” to have a stronger meaning than “distributed”: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for “decentralized” is “peer-to-peer” (P2P). </p><p>Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems:</p><ul><li>Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry—anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority.</li><li>Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage.</li><li>Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert.</li></ul><p>These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of… centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Nakamoto, 2008</em></p></blockquote><p>But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority.</p><p>Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi’s nod to Gnutella, anyone who’s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online.</p><p>Satoshi didn’t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam.</p><h3>Decentralized systems are governed through incentives</h3><p>The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating.</p><p>Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they’re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly.</p><p>The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market’s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system.</p><h3>II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods </h3><p>But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility.</p><p>Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc2ODgxNjk2MDA3NjIx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-80107pm.png" height="763" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true—traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems.</p><p>Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems.</p><h3>Computation is the first decentralized good</h3><p>The first example of a “decentralized good” is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3]</p><p>Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources—they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce.</p><p>The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital “proof” that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given “difficulty” which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority.</p><p>The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called “proof-of-work”.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo’s phrase, “unforgeable costliness”. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource." - Dwoak & Naor, 1993</em></p></blockquote><p>In Dwork & Naor’s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email.</p><p>Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a “pricing function” because, by adjusting the difficulty, a “pricing authority” could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a “price” for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam.</p><p>Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature “pricing function” and “pricing authority” supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource’s controller.</p><p>In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations.</p><h3>Currency is the second decentralized good </h3><p><br>But computations aren’t a good currency.</p><p>The proofs used to “trade” computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can’t be reused for a different input.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc2OTQ1ODUyMDgxNjA1/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-80516pm.png" height="708" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This constraint is useful – it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender’s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can’t be respent for sending a different email.</p><p>But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren’t fungible, they can’t be re-spent,[5] and they don’t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash.</p><p>Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems:</p><p>"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use." - Adam Back, 1997</p><p>We don’t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market.</p><p>Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere “access control mechanism”.</p><p>Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers…in the units of the currency that’s being created!</p><p>Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc2OTk2MzE3OTQ3MzMz/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-80825pm.png" height="652" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency</h3><p>Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints.</p><p>Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it:</p><ol><li>Computations through proof-of-work</li><li>Units of the currency we’re trying to build</li></ol><p>The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy—the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself!</p><p>The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi’s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo’s bit gold and Wei Dai’s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3MDM5MjY3NjIwMzgx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-81100pm.png" height="668" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h3>III. How can decentralized systems price computations?</h3><p>A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency.</p><p>We don’t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called “progress”.</p><p>Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn’t be progress—it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value.</p><p>When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable “prices” and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function.</p><p>But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty— as measured by the number of corresponding computations—may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price?</p><p>Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold:</p><blockquote><p><em>"The main problem…is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract "compute cycle." …Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3MDc1NTA2NDA2OTQx/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-81324pm.png" height="767" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the “cost of computing”. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money:</p><blockquote><p><em>'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units." - Dai, 1998<br></em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a “standard basket”, which computer solves a given problem “most economically”, or the cost of computation on the “open market”. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems!</p><p>To be fair to Dai, he realized this:</p><blockquote><p><em>"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol." - Dai, 1998</em></p></blockquote><p>Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let’s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo’s insights into the problem.</p><h3>Use external markets</h3><p>Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be “securely timestamped”:</p><blockquote><p><em>"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases “securely” and “distributed fashion” are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) “outside the system” services for timestamping.[6]</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3MTI5OTk4ODA0NTA5/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-81642pm.png" height="624" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>The time a unit of digital currency was created is important because it links the computations performed to real-world production cost.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right—the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was…" - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>"Inferring” the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold…" - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>To paraphrase Szabo, “to assay the value of… bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp”. The dealers defining “larger units of approximately equal value” are providing a similar pricing function as Dai’s “standard basket of commodities”. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger “units of approximately equal value” by dealers in markets outside the network.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3MTg1MDI4MDcyOTg5/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-82011pm.png" height="743" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw:</p><blockquote><p><em>"…The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address." - Szabo, 2005</em></p></blockquote><p>Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money.</p><h3>Use internal markets</h3><p>Szabo’s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it?</p><p>Let’s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi’s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney’s auction model[7]:</p><blockquote><p><em>"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]… instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: </em></p><p>Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures.</p><p>Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on.</p><p>Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation.</p><p>Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly." Dai, 1998</p></blockquote><p>B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo’s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other.</p><p>But implementing Dai’s proposal as written would be challenging:</p><ul><li>In the “Planning” phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the “optimal increase in the money supply for the next period”. How “optimal” should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described.</li><li>Regardless of what was planned, the “Bidding” phase allows anyone to submit a “bid” to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money.</li><li>Once bids are submitted, the “computation” phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it’s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted – when does the “Bidding” phase end and the “computation” phase begin?</li><li>These problems recur in the “Money ]reation” phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of “highest bids”? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency?</li></ul><p>Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented.</p><p>The root of this complexity is Dai’s belief that the “optimal” rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the “macroeconomic calculations” of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money.

                    <h3>IV. Satoshi’s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin</h3><p>In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi’s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust." - Satoshi, 2009</em></p></blockquote><p>Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks—with a concern about monetary policy. </p><p>Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The “optimal” rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. </p><p>This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi “discovered” bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. —and not someone else. It’s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply.</p><p>A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It’s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai’s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. </p><p>Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let’s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint.</p><h3>All 21M bitcoin already exist</h3><p>In b-money, each “money creation period” included a “Planning” phase, in which users were expected to share their “macroeconomic calculations” justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi’s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project.</p><p>Satoshi was able to replace the recurring “Planning” phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi’s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. </p><p>This changes the semantics of bitcoin’s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it’s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. </p><p>This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that “bitcoin miners create bitcoin”. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they’re buying it. Bitcoin isn’t valuable because “bitcoin are made from energy”—bitcoin’s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. </p><p>Let’s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn’t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus.</p><figure>

                        <figcaption>Satoshi’s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing “Planning” phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Bitcoin is priced through consensus</h3><p>This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the “Bidding” phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation “bids” from many different users. </p><p>Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn’t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi’s predetermined schedule. </p><p>The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8]</p><p>The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi’s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3NjE3NDc3NTkyNTE3/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-84705pm.png" height="453" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section):</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3NjMxNDM2MjM2MjI5/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-84748pm.png" height="448" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price.</p><p>Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus “blockchain” containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain.</p><p>Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy – just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented.</p><p>This added complexity was removed by Satoshi’s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy.</p><h3>Time closes all spreads</h3><p>In the “Computation” phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they’d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller – but who is the buyer?</p><p>In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. </p><p>In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. </p><p>The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner’s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. </p><p>Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to “execute a trade” but to pay the current asking price in computations. </p><p>The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid—the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network’s current asking price.</p><blockquote><p><em>To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008</em></p></blockquote><p>Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin’s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let’s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. </p><p>Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn’t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn’t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. </p><p>But Satoshi’s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. </p><p>Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo’s “secure timestamping protocol.” Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a “distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,” and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world “timechain” rather than “blockchain” to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin’s proof-of-work market.[10]</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3Njg4MDc2MTE3NDQ1/screenshot-2024-04-11-at-85128pm.png" height="728" width="1200">
                        <figcaption>Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Bitcoin’s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time.</p><h3>A standing order creates consensus </h3><p>The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the “Money creation” phase of b-money. </p><p>User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from “nothing at stake” problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the “highest bids…in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created” in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. </p><p>This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the “Byzantine generals” or sometimes the “double-spend” problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem – socalled “Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms”—require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially.</p><p>Bitcoin doesn’t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network’s current asking price— nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner’s resources. </p><p>Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin’s market has no phases—it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network.</p><p>This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] </p><p>We established in previous sections that bitcoin’s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! </p><p>Moreover, this new “Nakamoto consensus” only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing.</p><h3>IV. Conclusion</h3><p>B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi’s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin’s implementation.</p><p>There is a lot more to bitcoin’s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the “primary” market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. </p><p>The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.</p><figure>

Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/bitstein">Michael Goldstein</a> may be better known for his writing & memes, but I’d like to thank him for the archival work he does at the <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/">Nakamoto Institute</a> to keep safe the history of digital currencies.</p><h3>Footnotes</h3><p>[1] The title of this series is taken from the first telegraph message in history, sent by Samuel Morse in 1844: “What hath God wrought?”. </p><p>[2] Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, available: <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf </a></p><p>[3] Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail by Dwork and Naor available: <a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/%7enaor/PAPERS/pvp.pdf">https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/pvp.pdf</a> </p><p>[4] Despite originating the idea, Dwork & Naor did not invent “proof-of-work”—that moniker was provided later in 1999 by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. </p><p>[5] Hal Finney’s RPOW project was an attempt at creating transferable proofs-of-work but bitcoin doesn’t use this concept because it doesn't treat computations as currency. As we’ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. </p><p>[6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. </p><p>[7] Dai’s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi’s white paper, available: <a href="http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt">http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt </a></p><p>[8]There are two simplifications being made here: <br>a. The number of bitcoin being sold in each block is also affected by the transaction fee market, which is out of scope for this article, though lookout for subsequent work.<br>b. The difficulty as reported by bitcoin is not exactly the number of expected computations; one must multiply by a proportionality factor. </p><p>[9] At least not since the bad old days when Satoshi was the only miner on the network.

How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny.</p><blockquote><p>“Thiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.” – <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank#:~:text=Using%20stock%20deals%20unavailable%20to,the%20end%20of%202018%3A%20%2439%2C108.">ProPublica</a> (2021)</p></blockquote><p>Let’s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures.</p><h2>The different IRA structures</h2><p>The different IRA structures can behave in an “every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares” kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njg5OTQwMDA3MjAwMjg1/group-2085664027.png" height="630" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Brokerage and Bank IRAs</h3><p>Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained IRA</a> is closest to this structure in this hierarchy.</p><h3>Self-directed IRA (SDIRA)</h3><p>A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn’t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-investments-faqs">are not allowed</a> (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.).</p><h4>Checkbook IRA</h4><p>Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term “checkbook IRA” is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (“checkbook control”). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA.</p><h4>Non-checkbook self-directed IRA</h4><p>A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).</p><figure>

                    <h2>Risks to watch for when using a self-directed or checkbook IRA</h2><h4>1. Liquidity</h4><p>Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy.</p><h4>2. Formation and legal structure</h4><p>When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account.</p><p>With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA.</p><h4>3. Misreporting transactions</h4><p>Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions.</p><p>At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit <a href="https://www.iraresources.com/blog/how-to-report-the-fmv-of-your-self-directed-ira#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20self,total%20value%20of%20your%20IRA.">fair market valuation (FMV)</a> information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law.</p><h4>4. “Deemed distribution” treatment</h4><p>Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of “deemed distributions” treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA</a>. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC’s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her “unfettered control” over the LLC’s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA.</p><p>It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying “deemed distribution” treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/">IRS Publication 590</a>, it’s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/">Read more about the McNulty case and its implications</a>.</p><h4>5. Prohibited transactions</h4><p>All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. “Self-dealing” is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself—not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide “sweat equity.”</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njg5OTQ4MzI4Njk5NDIx/jessy_webinar_image-prev3-1.png" height="668" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>It’s not only the IRA owner that can’t participate in any “self-dealing,” but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-prohibited-transactions">penalties are stiff.</a> These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don’t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/mcnulty-v-commr-bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">IRS list of prohibited transactions here</a>.</p><p>Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors:</p><ul><li>Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets</li><li>Leverage without a non-recourse loan</li><li>Investing in certain collectible NFTs1</li></ul><h4>6. Financing</h4><p>Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases.</li><li>Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits.</li><li>IRA-owned active businesses could run into the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax">issue of UBIT</a> (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-iras-tax-implications/">mining within an IRA</a>.</li><li>Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA’s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs.</li></ul><h2>What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs?</h2><p>The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls.</p><h2>Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA</h2><p>If you’re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It’s not a “checkbook IRA” where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations.</p><p>There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.</p><p><em>This article is provided for educational purposes only, and cannot be relied upon as tax advice.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. </p><p>Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it’ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time – adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. </p><p>The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope – ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it’s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the <em>experience</em> of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). </p><p>Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal’s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. </p><p>When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription <em>4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0</em> is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction <em>4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079</em>. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions – but don’t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network – we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we <em>do </em>broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork – presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we’ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. </p><p>Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can’t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) “Layer Connector” that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs!</p><p>With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: </p><ul><li>Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes)</li><li>A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per “layer” (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.)</li><li>The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the “Dispatcher”. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. </li><li>The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code</li></ul><p>In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. </p><p>Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn’t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. </p><p>Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can’t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the “parent”. In order for miners to capture the fees from this “child” transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. </p><p>One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10’s or 100’s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we’d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would:</p><ul><li>look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate</li></ul><ul><li>Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel</li><li>Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address</li><li>Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped</li><li>It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions</li></ul><p>We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the “split” transaction here:<a href="https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f"> https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f</a> Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb.</p><p>The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn’t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas.</p><p>Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. </p><p>There are other aspects of the project that we haven’t covered here – how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one’s easy: it’s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rijndael.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event.</p><h3>What is Bitcoin halving?</h3><p>The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors.</p><h3>Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem</h3><p>The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin.</p><h2>Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients</h2><h3>Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC</h3><p><strong>1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving?</strong></p><p><em>As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving.</em></p><p><strong>2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p><em>The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving.</em></p><p><strong>3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards?</strong></p><p><em>I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I’ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future.</em></p><p><strong>4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</strong></p><p><em>Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren.</em></p><p><strong>5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price</strong></p><p><em>When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that’s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry.</em></p><p><strong>6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</strong></p><p><em>I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs.</em></p><h3>Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO</h3><p><strong>1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a "hodling" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs</p><p><strong>2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p>After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo</p><p>fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate.</p><p><strong>3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives.</p><p><strong>4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</strong></p><p>Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment.</p><p><strong>5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving</strong></p><p>In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success.</p><p><strong>6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</strong></p><p>Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively.</p><h2>Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell</h2><h3>Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving</h3><p><strong>Efficiency is Key:</strong> Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem.<br></p><p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances.</p><p><strong>Diversifying Revenue Streams:</strong> Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols.</p><p><strong>Adapt and Evaluate: </strong>Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards.</p><p><strong>Collaborative Mining: </strong>Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards.</p><p><strong>Leverage Mining Solutions:</strong> Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the difficulty of mining after halving?</strong></p><p>The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network.</p><p><br></p><p> After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards?<br></strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include:</p><ol><li><strong>Mining Altcoins: </strong>While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue.</li><li><strong>Mining Pools and Services:</strong> Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects.</li><li><strong>Hardware Sales and Leasing: </strong>Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations.</li><li><strong>Staking and Masternodes:</strong> Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees.</li><li><strong>Blockchain Development and Consulting:</strong> Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting.</li><li><strong>Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments:</strong> Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies.</li><li><strong>Energy Trading and Grid Services:</strong> Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs.</li></ol><p>Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential.</p><ol><li>Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point)</li><li>Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price</li><li>Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings</li><li>Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving</li><li>Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving</li></ol><p>Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions:</p><ol><li><strong>Price Volatility: </strong>Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics.</li><li><strong>Speculative Activity:</strong> Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions.</li><li><strong>Market Sentiment: </strong>Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines.</li><li><strong>Miner Behavior:</strong> The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics.</li><li><strong>Macro-Economic Factors: </strong>External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Outlook:</strong> Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest.</li></ol><p>While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved.</p><p><strong>Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition?</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Efficiency Improvements: </strong>One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs.</li><li><strong>Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing:</strong> Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability.</li><li><strong>Vertical Integration: </strong>Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams.</li><li><strong>Diversification of Revenue Streams:</strong> As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments.</li><li><strong>Hedging Strategies: </strong>Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement and Governance:</strong> Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability.</li></ol><p>Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Keaton Reckard.

<h2>Gold Throughout the Ages</h2><p>One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a “fine man’s suit” over time. This principle, known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga.<br><br>While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man’s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges.<br><br>For example, the cost of verification – or assaying – gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value.<br><br>Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/examining-decisions-that-lead-to-bitcoin">”Nixon Shock”</a> in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good.<br><br>This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-">Executive Order 6102</a> comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited “the hoarding of gold coin”, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven?</h2><p>Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals.</p><p>As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years – reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-store-of-value">store of value</a> better than gold, it is certainly promising. This “magic internet money” continues to rapidly gain on gold’s estimated <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">$15.9 trillion market capitalization.</a></p><h2>Gold’s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally</h2><p>Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals.<br></p><p>Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-work">proof of work</a> and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/the-infosec-basics-how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-seed-phrase-secure">informational nature</a>, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute.<br></p><p>Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/fully-noded-the-basics-and-benefits-of-running-a-bitcoin-node">Bitcoin’s network of nodes</a> and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified.

                    <p>As Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China.</p><p>Hong Kong’s new <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/as-hong-kong-approaches-in-kind-bitcoin">ETF</a> has been in the making for several months now, and it’s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it’s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF’s total assets under management (AUM) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hong-kongs-largest-bitcoin-etf-assets-up-five-fold-since-october-2024-02-29/">already</a> passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it’s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market.</p><p>Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chinas-largest-funds-spot-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong">big players</a> from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media <a href="https://www.stcn.com/article/detail/1167888.html">reported</a> that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Considering that there are already signs of <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-177-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b1855bff6f4e">diminishing</a> ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn’t Bitcoin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/">banned</a> in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/">report</a> $90 billion worth of transactions in one year?</p><figure>

                    <p>Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/02/05/china-never-completely-banned-crypto/">many</a> windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: “If you get scammed, don’t expect our help or sympathy." Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions.</p><p>It’s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it’s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they’ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/chinese-partnership-to-bring-large">invested</a> heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that’s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. </p><figure>

                    <p>Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong’s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin’s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? </p><p>As far as Hong Kong’s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kongs-za-bank-to-offer-custody-accounts-for-stablecoin-issuers/">banks</a> shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. <em>The South China Morning Post</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3258196/hong-kongs-hashkey-crypto-exchange-launches-global-platform-aim-overtaking-coinbase-5-years">reported</a> on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new “Global” initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to “overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years." A very tall order. </p><p>And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the <em>Post</em> that “We have seen their data and we don’t think that’ll be difficult”. He added that most global competitors are either “easy to use but not compliant”, or “compliant but hard to use”, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It’s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/08/hashkeys-crypto-exchange-goes-live-after-winning-license-in-bermuda/">offer</a> nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. </p><p>This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business’ reigning champs won’t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/web3-festival-attracts-smaller-crowd-093000150.html">reportedly</a> mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city’s own existing firms are confident that they’ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? </p><p><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=author-post-insert&utm_source=bmpro"></a></p><p>It’s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It’s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzODAxNjQxNTQzMTA5/default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1.jpg"><media:title>default_the_hong_kong_skyline_during_sunset_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjYzOTc0NTEzOTc2Nzcz/553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833.jpg"><media:title>553d4b4e-ceb2-4dbc-b3bd-a35d31deec64_1500x833</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/eastern-asia-cryptocurrency-adoption/?ref=blockhead.co">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png"><media:title>bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em>Click the image to learn more.</em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin startups raised $301 million through all of last year alone.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report</guid><category><![CDATA[Report]]></category><category><![CDATA[Start Up]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a> (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. </p><p>Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxODM3NDQ3MjI2OTA5/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am.png" height="669" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxOTQwNzk0ODc3Mzgx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am.png" height="671" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>“The early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for ‘crypto’ venture’s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,” said Calicott. “With a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.”</p><p>In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyMTI0NjczMTY0NzQx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am.png" height="674" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>“Due to cyclicality and bitcoin’s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,” Calicott continued. “Despite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.”</p><p>TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector.</p><p>The full TVP Bitcoin startup ecosystem research brief is available for <a href="https://tvp.fund/whitepapers/bitcoin-venture-capital-research/">download</a>, offering a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape and investment opportunities in Bitcoin-native technologies.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg"><media:title>default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxODM3NDQ3MjI2OTA5/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-94537am</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQxOTQwNzk0ODc3Mzgx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-95140am</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyMTI0NjczMTY0NzQx/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am.png"><media:title>screenshot-2024-04-10-at-100327am</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wall Street Is Buying US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: 13F SEC Fillings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Major Wall Street institutions like Park Avenue Securities and Inscription Capital bought into spot bitcoin ETFs in Q1 according to just-released SEC 13F filings.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wall-street-is-buying-us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-13f-sec-fillings</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wall-street-is-buying-us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-13f-sec-fillings</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 11:50:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3Nzg2NjEyNzU0MTE1/bitcoin-etf-delayed-but-wall-street-has-on-ramps.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest 13F filings with the SEC reveal that major institutional investors have been acquiring shares in the new spot <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">bitcoin ETFs</a> that launched this quarter.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: Wall Street firms with a combined $15 BILLION in AUM bought exposure to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETFs in Q1<br><br>This is just the beginning 💥 <a href="https://t.co/MQ1TZp8tQp">pic.twitter.com/MQ1TZp8tQp</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1778373845243625633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
