<p>The price structure of ICON shows a fierce battle, with bulls initially dominating the price and holding the upper hand as the price jumped from $0.1500 to $0.4000. Nevertheless, bears disrupted the market on March 14th, 2024, leading to a loss of momentum for the bulls. Therefore, bears dominated and set new lower lows and highs on the daily chart, leading to the formation of support at $0.2000. After that, the price consolidated at this critical level for a couple of daily sessions.</p>



<p>The latest price indicates a spike from the support base at $0.2000 by April 20th and illustrates a minor pushback from bears, possibly signaling a return of bullish momentum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the ICON crypto price approaches the primary resistance levels from the 20-day and 50-day EMAs on the daily asset chart. Meanwhile, RSI is at 45.96 and has taken support on 14-SMA, and MACD is at -0.184 with a bullish cross.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the ICON price has increased by +4.37% since yesterday and was $0.2606 at press time. If demand for ICX increases, it may rebound remarkably from its present price level. The next target for the price may be to hit $0.3000; beyond this price level, it could stretch up to $0.3400.</p>



<p>Conversely, if the ICX crypto price asset drops below the $0.2000 threshold support, it may continue to fall and reach lower points in the coming sessions.</p>

<p><strong><em>SEC Philippines ordered the removal of the Binance app from Google and Apple app stores due to security threats to investors and the local economy.</em></strong></p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is collaborating with Google and Apple to eliminate applications managed by Binance, a cryptocurrency giant, from app marketplaces in the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Letter To Binance</strong></h2>



<p>On April 19, the SEC sent separate letters to both Google and Apple requesting the removal of the Binance-controlled applications from the Google Play and Apple App Store. The SEC has identified Binance and concluded that continued public access to these websites/apps threatens the security of the funds of investing Filipinos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter, the Chairperson of the Securities and<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/03/23/heres-why-thailand-securities-and-exchange-commission-banned-crypto-transactions/"> Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), Emilio B. Aquino, indicated that the act of selling or offering unregistered securities to Filipinos, as well as operating as an unregistered broker, violates Republic Act no. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code.</p>



<p>Mr. Aquino emphasized that removing and blocking Binance&#8217;s applications would help prevent the further spread of its illegal activities in the country, which could negatively impact the economy. This action aims to safeguard the investing public from any potential harm.</p>



<p>The request from the SEC and the National Telecommunications Commission to block access to websites used by Binance in the country followed this.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Warning</strong></h3>



<p>The SEC warned the public against investing in and using Binance. It began studying the possible blocking of Binance&#8217;s website and other online presence in the Philippines as early as November 2023.</p>



<p>Binance is a large crypto trading platform with over 183 million members, trading more than 402 cryptocurrencies daily.</p>



<p>However, it needs the necessary license to operate an exchange for buying and selling securities, as the law requires. The SEC advises Filipino investors to close their positions or transfer their crypto holdings to duly registered providers. However, the SEC has yet to secure a license for Binance to solicit investments from the public or operate an exchange to buy and sell securities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Problem With Binance According To SEC</strong></h3>



<p>Binance has been involved in various regulatory-related issues worldwide. In Canada, it is facing a new class-action lawsuit alleging that it violates local securities laws. At the same time, it has agreed to pay a $2 Million fine for previous non-compliance with local regulations in India.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the cryptocurrency exchange has received its crypto license in Dubai, known as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), after Binance&#8217;s co-founder gave up his voting power in the exchange&#8217;s local entity.</p>



<p>On April 8, an SEC official reiterated that they had already given users three months and an extension. It was done to facilitate the withdrawal of their funds from the exchange. After this period, the SEC said they could not endorse any methods for retrieving funds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Google and Apple are removing Binance&#8217;s cryptocurrency apps in the Philippines due to unregistered security sales violating local regulations. Binance has faced other regulatory issues globally. However, the cryptocurrency exchange received its crypto license in Dubai after Binance&#8217;s co-founder forfeited his voting power in the exchange&#8217;s local entity.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="817" src="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-221.png" alt="" class="wp-image-202917" srcset="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-221.png 1000w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-221-300x245.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-221-768x627.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-221-750x613.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Source: </strong>Qubic </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Independent operating system: </strong>The infrastructure of the blockchain allows individuals to operate directly on metal without requiring an operating system. Speedy execution of tasks, top-notch security, and effective use of hardware are some advantages.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Fastest smart contracts: </strong>The smart contract of Qubic is written using C++ and ensures faster execution of transactions. Faster execution thus mitigates issues related to huge transaction times and improves the reliability of smart contract execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Speed and security: </strong>Speed and security are other key features of the Qubic network. Direct interaction and operations on bare metal leverage the full capabilities of the hardware, offering high-level performance. It also bypasses any of the bottlenecks or issues effortlessly for rapid execution of tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Complete Working</strong></h3>



<p>The working of the Qubic network depends on three main factors that are consensus mechanism, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The network is developed on distributed ledger technology that uses the UPoW consensus mechanism to maintain protected and synchronized records of all dealings. In the Qubic network, nodes play a crucial role in confirming transactions, which firms the ledger&#8217;s reliability and Integrity.</p>



<p>Qubic smart contracts are automated contracts with their conditions embedded within the code itself. These contracts permit the independent execution of various operations, like asset transfers or contract fulfillment, without relying on a central entity. This automation not only cuts down on expenses but also supports the system&#8217;s security and openness.</p>



<p>Developers can craft cutting-edge, purpose-specific DApps on the Qubic platform. These applications utilize the platform&#8217;s abilities for smart contracts and tokens, enabling them to engage with the blockchain and smart contracts. Hence, users enjoy a seamless experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where To Use The Token?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>QUBIC is the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/01/30/horizen-crypto-working-features-and-its-native-token-zen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">native token</a> of the network with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000 and a total supply of 89,403,076,230,161. The token has a self-circulating supply of 88,512,924,942,517.         </p>



<p>The tokens are used for micropayments and offer feeless transfers, revolutionizing the industries with small transactions. The tokens can also be used for powering AI training and validation processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also considered a game-changer in the field of supply chain and logistics and offers secure, fast, and real-time tracking of supply chains. In short, the network unlocks a wide range of possibilities across different domains with its fast, reliable, and secure ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How To Invest In QUBIC?</strong></h3>



<p>Investing in QUBIC requires several steps which are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Creating a seed or password is the initial step and requires a string consisting of 55 lowercase characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, the user is provided with the Qubic ID which is a 60-character long string generated from the seed and operates similarly to a public key. Adding a seed to the wallet will help in getting the ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Finding a seller for encountering a deal and sharing the Qubic ID with the seller is the next step. Currently&nbsp; Over The Counter (OTC) deals are organized which permits the seller and the buyer to sign a deal directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>To finalize the deal and make the transaction, the user needs the wallet along with creating a vault to interact with Qubic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>The next step is to log in to the account and confirm transactions by entering the amount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The QUBIC token is currently available on a few of the cryptocurrency exchanges like SafeTrade, TradeOgre, SevenSeas, and Bitkonan.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Investment banking company Benchmark has issued a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating for Bitcoin miner Hut 8, setting a $12 share price target.</em></strong></p>



<p>Hut 8, is looking to expand its self-mining operations and diversify its revenue streams to remain competitive in the post-halving market. Despite having a lower self-mining hash rate than its competitors, Benchmark expects Hut 8 to close the gap over time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Report By Benchmark’s Analyst</strong></h2>



<p>Palmer cited Hut 8&#8217;s multiple revenue streams, including self-mining, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence services, as justification for his price target.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also said that Hut 8&#8217;s enterprise value-to-revenue multiple of 2.6 is slightly below the 3.1 average of its publicly traded Bitcoin mining peers, such as Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and others.</p>



<p>Although Hut 8 still needs to upgrade its hash rate, Palmer said its 9,102 Bitcoin held on reserve provides it with a &#8220;sizable liquidity cushion&#8221; and an ability to capture upside moves if the price of BTC were to rally significantly in the coming months.</p>



<p>On February 7, Hut 8 announced a leadership shakeup, with Asher Genoot replacing former CEO Jamie Leverton. Hut 8 refuted the report, claiming it was filled with inaccurate information and misrepresented data.</p>



<p>Hut 8 aims to increase its cash flow, reduce <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/11/worlds-fastest-bitcoin-mining-firm-has-raised-another-80-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mining</a> costs, and boost Bitcoin production by approximately 11% per EH by relocating efficient miners to its Medicine Hat site while retiring old and inefficient ones.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hut 8&#8217;s diverse business operations may provide an advantage following the halving.</strong></h3>



<p>Investors are currently showing interest in self-mining as they expect the price of bitcoin to increase significantly after the latest halving, according to a statement. Hut 8, which has a self-mining deployed hash rate of 5.4 exahash per second (EH/s), is lagging behind some of the largest players in the same category, including Marathon Digital, which had 27.8 EH/s of installed hash rate at the same time, the statement added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement also stated that Hut 8&#8217;s diversified platform is likely to provide long-term benefits, as its revenue streams outside of self-mining put it in a better position to withstand severe downturns in bitcoin&#8217;s price compared to most of its listed peers.</p>



<p>Hut 8&#8217;s merger with US Bitcoin Corp. in November, which created a combined company with 25.5 EH/s of hash rate and 884 MW of energy capacity under management, also has business lines focused on managed services, hosting, high-performance computing and AI, the statement added.</p>



<p>Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has been working on reducing costs and eliminating inefficiencies in all business lines. In a recent statement, the company announced it had energized a third of its 63 MW Salt Creek site in Culberson County, TX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It relocated miners from its Kearney, NE and Granbury, TX sites to that location. According to the statement, the company&#8217;s holdings of 9,102 BTC &#8211; second in the mining segment to Marathon Digital &#8211; give it a solid liquidity cushion and the ability to capture upside during bitcoin price rallies.</p>



<p>The statement also pointed out that Hut 8&#8217;s mining fleet needs more efficiency upgrades. However, its diversified model and relative strength in bitcoin&#8217;s price should support its operating performance until new equipment is purchased and deployed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Hut 8 has received a buy rating from one of the investment banks. The company announced a leadership change after a report from JCapital claimed it was in legal trouble. Hut 8 denied the report. Investors are interested in self-mining as they expect the price of bitcoin to rise after the latest halving. Hut 8 lags behind Marathon Digital in installed hash rate.</p>

<p><em><strong>Amidst ongoing debate among gamers regarding the incorporation of &#8220;tokenomics&#8221; into gaming experiences, industry executives predict that gaming studios will persist in utilizing airdrops and other incentives to attract players.</strong></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Founders Share Their Views About Gaming Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>Kieran Warwick, founder of gaming studio Illuvium, emphasized the effectiveness of such tactics in capturing market share. He stated in an interview with Cointelegraph, &#8220;It’s a very easy way to get market share.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Warwick also underscored the importance of prioritizing fun and gameplay quality in gaming experiences, asserting that games lacking in these aspects are destined to fail.</p>



<p>Warwick said, <em>&#8220;The problem with that is if you’re using it as a marketing tool and you don’t have a good product to back it up, then your retention is abysmal.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Shi Khai Wei, founder of venture capital firm LongHash Ventures, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the critical role of enjoyment in gaming experiences. Despite the ability advantages of token incentives, Wei emphasized that sustainable economics and attractive gameplay are crucial for a recreation&#8217;s fulfillment.</p>



<p>Shi Khai Wei, <em>“Crypto is very good at acquiring users because of incentives — we have airdrops, play-to-earn mechanics and speculative elements, but to keep the players there, you need to have fun gameplay.”</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Axie Infinity Shared Success Stories of Blockchain Games</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/10/axie-infinity-in-bullish-momentum-can-axs-reach-15-in-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axie Infinity</a> stands as one of the most outstanding achievement memories inside the realm of blockchain video games. However, challenges such as a $650 Million bridge hack have posed hurdles for its creator firm, Sky Mavis, in retaining users&#8217; post-bear market.<br><br>Wei said, <em>“Games that figure out sustainable economics, the right emission schedules, attracting the right kind of players and incentivizing the right kind of gameplay, those are the games that will survive.”</em></p>



<p>Wei emphasized the importance of implementing sustainable economics, attracting the right player demographic, and incentivizing enjoyable gameplay as key factors for a game&#8217;s survival in the competitive gaming landscape.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Idea To Make Money</strong></h3>



<p>While Warwick acknowledged that token incentives may attract airdrop farmers rather than genuine gamers, he views them as a necessary tool for expanding the player base. He highlighted the attention garnered from individuals active in the gaming space as a positive outcome of token incentives.</p>



<p>Warwick&#8217;s perspective aligns with Illuvium&#8217;s recent initiative, releasing 200,000 ILV tokens valued at approximately $25 Million for its Play-to-Airdrop program.</p>



<p>Gabby Dizon, CEO of Yield Guild Games, emphasized the potential of airdrops to accelerate the adoption of GameFi (gaming decentralized finance). However, Dizon noted that financial returns may not be the primary motivation for all gamers. Despite being several years behind traditional gaming, Dizon and Warwick anticipate rapid progress in the GameFi sector, driven by blockchain&#8217;s faster innovation rate compared to traditional gaming.</p>



<p>Warwick highlighted the time-consuming process of building intellectual property (IP) in the gaming industry, noting that leading gaming studios are only halfway through this process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He emphasized the desire for persistence and highlighted the anticipation for a dominant GameFi assignment that would propel the sector ahead, corresponding to Clash of Clans and Candy Crush in the early 2010s.</p>



<p>Yield Guild Games envisions a destiny in which blockchain games reach the same quality as traditional gaming giants, aiming to facilitate this progress through its decentralized network of gaming guilds. Despite uncertainties, Wei expressed confidence in the GameFi industry&#8217;s potential, predicting the release of an AAA-standard game in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the integration of token incentives into gaming experiences may face skepticism from some gamers, industry executives believe that such strategies will persist as gaming studios strive to attract and retain players in the evolving landscape of GameFi.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Canadian province of Manitoba has opted to extend a moratorium on new requests for electric providers from the authorities-owned Manitoba Hydro company meant for cryptocurrency operations.</strong></em></p>



<p>This decision mirrors a similar suspension of carriers carried out in British Columbia (BC), even though the processes taken by each province vary in their specifics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Extension of Manitoba</strong></h2>



<p>Manitoba&#8217;s extension of the pause relates to new requests from crypto miners and requests for electric-powered service, which have yet to result in the execution of agreements to assemble essential infrastructure. This pass reflects Manitoba&#8217;s cautious stance on handling the burgeoning call for strength from cryptocurrency mining sports.</p>



<p>The preliminary pause on electric connections to<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/05/07/kazakhstanian-tenge-pulled-for-crypto-mining-tax-7-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> crypto-mining</a> operations was instituted with the aid of the provincial government in November 2022, spanning 18 months. With the recent extension, the pause is slated to persist until April 30, 2026. </p>



<p>During this time, the province intends to formulate a complete, long-term technique to address the demanding situations related to the growing call for electricity from cryptocurrency mining operations.</p>



<p>It said in an announcement, <em>&#8220;Manitoba Hydro continues to expect unprecedented demand for electricity from new or expanding cryptocurrency operations. That demand has the potential to drastically increase our total electrical load.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reason For Extension</strong></h2>



<p>The choice to increase the moratorium became underpinned by issues over the pressure on Manitoba&#8217;s electric infrastructure. Former CEO of Manitoba Hydro, Jay Grewal, highlighted the magnitude of the assignment in 2022, noting that connecting every cryptocurrency operator expressing hobby would bring about an astonishing growth of 4,600 megawatts in total electrical load. It posed a considerable venture considering Manitoba Hydro&#8217;s overall ability stood at 6,100 megawatts.</p>



<p>In contrast, British Columbia initiated a comparable suspension of carriers for brand-spanking new crypto miners in December 2022, affecting 21 tasks. However, BC has taken a divergent approach by introducing amendments to its Utilities Commission Act to regulate electricity service to cryptocurrency miners.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Provincial government directs Manitoba Hydro to continue pause on cryptocurrency connections <a href="https://t.co/nzIp06D1nK">https://t.co/nzIp06D1nK</a> <a href="https://t.co/QgvIFxWPr9">pic.twitter.com/QgvIFxWPr9</a></p>&mdash; HYDROVISION International (@HYDROVISIONIntl) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYDROVISIONIntl/status/1782506692053258392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Provincial Energy Minister Josie Osborne outlined the amendments, which would empower the BC government to prohibit, restrict, or regulate service to crypto miners.</p>



<p><em>“We’re working with BC Hydro to ensure we have the electricity we need […] and that includes regulating electricity service for energy-intensive cryptocurrency miners that create very few local jobs.”</em></p>



<p>BC&#8217;s pass to introduce regulatory measures displays a choice to address the challenges posed by cryptocurrency mining sports, even while ensuring the sustainability and reliability of the province&#8217;s electrical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, BC boasts some of North America&#8217;s lowest industrial and industrial electricity charges, making it an attractive vacation spot for cryptocurrency miners seeking cost-effective energy answers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Manitoba and British Columbia have both grappled with the impact of cryptocurrency mining on their respective electric infrastructures, prompting them to implement measures to control the demand for electricity from this area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manitoba&#8217;s choice to increase the moratorium on new electric provider requests for cryptocurrency operations underscores the province&#8217;s commitment to addressing these challenges proactively and sustainably. Similarly, BC&#8217;s circular to introduce regulatory amendments reflects a concerted effort to strive for stability by facilitating financial development and safeguarding the stability of its electrical grid.</p>
