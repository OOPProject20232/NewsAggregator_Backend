<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MINU Crypto Statistics Overview</strong></h2>



<p>The price of MINU (MINU/WBNB) on Pancakeswap V2 (BSC) currently stands at $0.0000002898. The price has seen a decrease of -19.83% in the last 24 hours. It has been reported that the 24-hour trading volume of MINU/WBNB is $49,260.60 with a total of 329 transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contract address for MINU/WBNB is 0x91d8d7dfcadc8e04195e75069e1316e01ba7f01c. The Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of MINU/WBNB is $28.98 Million, and the liquidity pool is $237.04K.</p>



<p>The 24-hour high for MINU/WBNB stands at $0.0000003661 while the 24-hour low currently is at $0.0000002553. The current liquidity of the MINU/WBNB pool with contract address 0x91d8d7dfcadc8e04195e75069e1316e01ba7f01c is $237,043.72. The pool was created a year ago, and its last transaction was recorded recently.</p>



<p>The exchange rate of 1 MINU to WBNB is $0.0000000005326. Based on this exchange rate, 1 USD would be able to acquire 3,450,334.16 MINU. The amount of pooled MINU is 407,922,667,320.32 ($118,521.86), and the amount of pooled WBNB is 217.81 ($118,521.86).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MINU Crypto Price Forecast</strong></h2>

<p>MINU crypto has seen a fall of 1.95% in the past 24 hours and is being traded at $0.0000002726 at this moment of writing.</p>



<p>Therefore, if the demand for the MINU price (MINU) increases from the current support, it could bounce back remarkably. The next target for the price could be to reach $0.0000006000 and $0.0000008500. Another possibility would be if the price value of MINU crypto fails to stay above $0.0000002475, it could also see a further decrease.</p>

<p>The Ethereum Ecosystem shows signs of strain as investors begin to gather, raising questions about its future resilience. Concurrently, Injective&#8217;s INJ faces a slump despite the launch of its 3.0 upgrade, hinting at a potential end to its long bullish streak.</p>



<p>Amidst these uncertainties, <a href="https://blockdag.network/">BlockDAG</a> emerges as a beacon of promise. With its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph technology, the recent Shibuya keynote and release of its moon-based keynote teaser have positioned BlockDAG not just as a competitor but as a potential leader in blockchain technology, suggesting crypto with 30,000x Potential, ready to redefine industry standards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Evaluating the Ethereum Ecosystem Amidst Declining Gas Usage</strong></h2>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/16/crypto-trader-who-made-millions-from-pepe-invests-300000-in-new-ethereum-token/">Ethereum</a> has seen a decline in gas usage and overall activity, signaling a potential slowdown in its ecosystem. As reported by Dune Analytics, Ethereum&#8217;s gas dropped to a year-low of 12.5 gwei, reflecting decreased transaction demand. Despite this, Ethereum&#8217;s price saw a modest uptick of 5.61%, with trading figures reaching $3,242.75, possibly driven by increased interest from large-scale investors.</p>

<p>While this surge in price might seem positive, it could lead to market manipulation and volatility. Additionally, the total number of addresses holding Ethereum has grown, indicating both large investors and retail investors are getting involved. However, Ethereum&#8217;s velocity has decreased, suggesting fewer transactions, which could impact prices in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>INJ Price Prediction Following INJ 3.0 News</strong></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/16/injective-kelexo-presale-takes-off-with-20x-rumors/">Injective (INJ)</a> Protocol has been undergoing significant price corrections despite the recent announcement of INJ 3.0, which aims to enhance its tokenomics. From a high in March, INJ&#8217;s value has dropped by over 50%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new governance proposal might stabilize the token&#8217;s inflation, but predictions remain cautious given the historical performance and ongoing market correction. INJ might continue to see a volatile market position in the near term, complicating forecasts for its recovery and growth.</p>

<p>The Quant token price has been experiencing significant selling pressure over the past few weeks, resulting in a loss of approximately 30%. It has fallen below the 200-day exponential moving average and is now defending the $100 mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysis of the technical chart reveals that the Quant crypto price has been facing resistance at the $150 hurdle for a year. Although the price attempted to surpass this mark last month, sellers proved strong enough to bring the price back down. Over the past four months, the price has faced rejection three times at the $150 mark, indicating the prevalence of sellers at this level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on technical indicators, the RSI has been declining for a month and is heading towards the oversold zone. This suggests that sellers have been dominating the market and that the price may continue to be bearish for the next few days. The Quant crypto price is currently trading below the exponential moving averages, indicating negative sentiment.</p>

<p>According to the chart, there has been a consistent level of social interaction regarding CAKE cryptocurrency on social media in recent months. It is possible that changes in the social dominance and social volume graphs could impact the fluctuations in the CAKE crypto chart.</p>

<!-- TradingView Chart END -->



<p>The QNT token price has found support at $100 over a longer period of time. At present, the price has dropped and fallen below the exponential moving averages, settling at the support level of $100.</p>



<p>If the QNT crypto price continues to trade below the $100 support level, this may cause sellers to feel more confident, while buyers may choose to exit their positions. If this happens, panic selling might occur, leading to a continuous decline in the price over the coming weeks.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if the QNT price manages to defend the $100 support level and increase, it may gain short-term bullish momentum. If the Quant token price exceeds the 200-day EMA, it may extend to $150.</p>



<p>The current trading price for Quant is $100.38, which has fallen by 1.38% over the last 24 hours. The market capitalization is $1.21 Billion, and the fully diluted market cap is $1.50 Billion. The total circulating supply is 12,072,738 QNT, while the total supply is 14,881,364 QNT.</p>



<p>Over a 4-hour time frame, the QNT price has been experiencing resistance from a trendline, causing a decline. If the Quant token price can surpass this trendline and maintain its position, it may result in buying pressure for the short term.</p>



<p>Conversely, if the Quant crypto price fails to surpass the trendline and sellers remain dominant, the price may continue to decline for the next few days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Quant Crypto Volume vs Price Are Decreasing</strong></h2>

<p>The trading volume has been decreasing by forming lower lows, as can be observed from the volume and price graph. In a span of one month, the trading volume fell drastically from $120 Million to $18 Million, and this has had a corresponding effect on the QNT price. It is possible that if the trading volume increases, then the price may experience bullish momentum.</p>

<p>The dominance of the bears in the KIN price analysis is evident as they have managed to pull down the price more aggressively than the bulls. The sellers have been making short positions persistently, which has resulted in a downward trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The price has been halted near the value of $0.00002840 before resuming its bearish momentum. On the daily technical chart, the KIN price analysis reveals the bear&#8217;s control. Consistent short positions by sellers have caused a continuous decline in the price. The price has halted at higher levels and resumed its downward trend on a daily basis.</p>

Although there have been recent attempts to recover and exceed the key EMA level, the price was pulled down by sellers.

<p>The technical summary of the KIN cryptocurrency suggests that a sell signal is evident. This is because out of 26 analysts, 15 have recommended selling, 10 have remained neutral, while only 1 has recommended buying. Furthermore, the maximum weightage is given to the sell side. As a result, the technical summary indicates that the trend is being dominated by bears, and most analysts are supporting the bearishness by recommending selling.</p>

<p>American investors are eagerly lining up to secure their share of BITBOT tokens. They are anticipating possible 100x returns once the token lists on exchanges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitbot’s ICO unlocks the future of trading</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://bitbot.tg/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_id=BBOT126&amp;utm_content=price_prediction&amp;utm_campaign=thecoinrepublic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bitbot</a> is a unique Telegram trading bot that equips everyday investors to compete with the titans of institutional investment. It is firmly placing the reins of asset management in the hands of its users. </p>



<p>Distinctive features, such as complete sovereignty over user assets—upholding the mantra &#8220;your keys, your wallet, your assets&#8221;—establish Bitbot as the<strong> first-ever non-custodial telegram trading bot.</strong></p>



<p>The promise of Bitbot lies in its core offering, thoroughly presented in its <a href="https://bitbot.tg/Bitbot_Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">whitepaper</a>. The full custody of assets combined with a powerhouse of resources is designed to elevate the trading game for every user. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitbot transforms the market one trade at a time</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/02/bitbot-presale-soars-in-the-united-states-with-btc-prediction-to-reach-150k-in-2024/">Bitbot</a> is the world’s first non-custodial trading bot. It is also the first to set new standards in an erupting market worth over $1.3 billion. Research indicates that it will grow at a rate of 37% in the forecast period 2023-2029. </p>



<p>At the heart of Bitbot is its integrated market intelligence. That resulted from strategic partnerships with leading data platforms like Birdeye, Dex Screener, and DexView.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an ecosystem where community and shared knowledge are pivotal, Bitbot sets a new standard with its streamlined token-sharing feature. This revolutionary functionality allows users to effortlessly share insights on promising tokens with their Telegram groups. Thus, it amplifies the potential for collective success and mitigating the all-too-common FOMO.</p>



<p>There are also plans to integrate cross-chain functionality across some of the most dynamic ecosystems in the crypto world. Those ecosystems are Solana, Base, BSC, and Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Bitbot is on the cusp of expanding its domain, directly capitalizing on the increasing activity on Solana.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solana price prediction: A golden opportunity for Bitbot ICO investors</strong></h3>



<p>The Solana ecosystem is currently experiencing an electrifying surge in activity. Solana&#8217;s decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem has grown and thrived in recent months. This uptick in dApp activity signals a robust and engaged community, laying a fertile ground for Bitbot&#8217;s integration and success.</p>



<p>The meme coin phenomenon further bolstered Solana&#8217;s appeal, drawing volumes that underscore the network&#8217;s utility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana&#8217;s market position has strengthened. It became the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and achieved an 800% increase over the past year. So, the stage is set for transformative growth. Next, experts state that the Solana price prediction hints at a potential climb to $300 post-Bitcoin halving.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitbot price prediction: From undervalued gem to dominating a multibillion-dollar market</strong></h3>



<p>In a market affected by initial teething problems, <a href="https://bitbot.tg/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_id=BBOT126&amp;utm_content=price_prediction&amp;utm_campaign=thecoinrepublic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitbot</a> is poised to shatter expectations and redefine success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the confluence of heightened activity on <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/15/grab-this-crypto-opportunity-if-you-didnt-cash-in-on-the-solana-meme-coin-craze/">Solana</a> and the burgeoning realm of AI-driven trading bots positions Bitbot at the vanguard of a market revolution. </p>



<p>Created by ex-Wall Street traders injecting unparalleled expertise and insight into its development, ‘alpha’ is shared with the community via <a href="https://medium.com/@OfficialBitbot" rel="nofollow">Medium blogs</a>. For example, Bitbot&#8217;s utilization of AI is a game-changer, propelling it beyond the limitations of traditional trading bots.</p>



<p>The unequaled access Bitbot provides via its gem scanner and exclusive alpha list to snipe low-cap gems. That reinforces its position as an indispensable tool for traders. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned trader or newbie, Bitbot&#8217;s suite of features promises an unmatched level of flexibility and insight. Those features range from copying top performers’ trades to its planned expansion across blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and BSC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the crypto trading bot market still delivering impressive returns despite some challenges, Bitbot&#8217;s entry could not be more timely. Capturing even a modest share of this burgeoning multibillion-dollar market could see Bitbot&#8217;s value skyrocket. Analysts project impressive 10X growth in the short term and an ambitious 50X to 100X trajectory on the longer horizon.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

With its intuitive interface, Bitbot dismantles the barriers traditionally associated with crypto trading for American investors.</p>

<p><em>It is important to understand the dynamics of the total loan balance, which is responsible for financial management. Whether a user has a mortgage, student loans, auto loans, personal loans, or credit card debt,. The factors that can increase the total loan balance are varied and significant.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Total Loan Balance</strong></h2>



<p>The calculation of the total loan balance involves considering multiple factors and the exact method can differ depending on the type of loan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A general overview of the calculation of the loan balance is as follows:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Principal Amount</strong></h3>



<p>It is the initial amount that a user has borrowed. The loan balance starts with the principal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interest</strong></h3>



<p>Interest is the cost of borrowing money and is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). The lender applies this interest rate to the outstanding principal balance to calculate the amount of interest. The amount of interest decreases with the decrease in principal.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accrued Interest</strong></h3>



<p>If a creditor has a loan with compound interest, interest is charged on both the principal and the unpaid interest. For example, if interest is charged on daily compounding, the lender is required to calculate a daily interest amount.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Additional fees</strong></h3>



<p>Some loans come with fees, such as organization fees or late payment fees. These fees can increase total balances.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Payments made</strong></h3>



<p>As the payment is made on the loan, the amount of principal gets reduced, and the remaining payments cover the interest and fees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Missed Payments</strong></h3>



<p>The failure in payments can lead to an increase in additional fees and interest that increases the total loan balances.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Loan term</strong></h3>



<p>It is the length of a time over which a lender is repaying the loan affects total balance. The longer term increases the total interest payments.</p>



<p>Factors to leading in Total Loan Balances</p>



<p>Interest rates</p>



<p>The type of interest rate that is, fixed or variable and the rate directly affects the amount of interest and loan balance.</p>



<p>The higher interest rates can substantially increase the cost of loan over time.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Loans with higher interest rates</strong></h3>



<p>The monthly payments on a higher interest rate loan include a higher interest component and leads to lower reduction in principal. It results in the higher loan balance over the life of the loan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Loans with lower interest rates</strong></h3>



<p>Lower interest rates results in the higher reduction of principal after the monthly payments and it goes towards the reduction of the principal balance. It can result in a lower total loan balance over time.</p>



<p>In October 2023, Bankrate study published a report where it stated that the average personal interest in the United States is 11.43%. It is important to note that there are multiple factors that can impact the credit score, including income, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, loan term and others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td>Credit Score</td><td>Average Interest Rates</td></tr><tr><td>720-850</td><td>10.73% &#8211; 12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>690-719</td><td>13.5% &#8211; 15.5%</td></tr><tr><td>630-689</td><td>17.80%- 19.90%</td></tr><tr><td>300-629</td><td>28.50%-32.00%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Source: Bankrate</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Term of the Loan</strong></h3>



<p>The duration of the loan can significantly affect the total balance. Short term loans generally come with lower interest costs and higher monthly payments. Long term loans can offer lower monthly payments but can lead to higher high overall interest expenses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Delayed or Missed Payments</strong></h3>



<p>The failure to make timely payment can result in late fees and penalties. Furthermore, it can increase interest costs, as interest is calculated on the outstanding balance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Loan Refinancing</strong></h3>



<p>Loan refinancing can reduce the monthly payments as it may increase the total loan balance over the life of the loan. It is important to understand when and how the refinance is beneficial and essential. If a user does not have a strong understanding of <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/15/tradi-finance-firms-favor-public-blockchains-ex-grayscale-exec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finance</a> and the working of a loan, they should consult a financial advisor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Additional Financing</strong></h3>



<p>It takes out more loans while they still manage their existing debt, which can lead to a snowball effect, increasing their overall financial burden. It is a risky idea to take out a new loan to pay off the existing one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inflation And Other Economic Factors</strong></h3>



<p>External economic factors, such as inflation, can affect the real value of a loan. It is important to consider these factors while managing the total loan balance over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact on loans at fixed interest </strong></h4>



<p>If a borrower has a loan at a fixed interest rate, their monthly payment remains constant throughout the loan tenure. It provides stability – as inflation increases, it decreases the real cost of the loan. Stated differently, the fixed payments that a user makes have decrease future purchasing power.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact on variable interest loans</strong></h4>



<p>In contrast, variable interest rate loans can also get impacted by inflation. These loans have an interest rate that is tied to a benchmark rate, such as the prime rate. With the increase in inflation, the central bank may increase the benchmark rates to cover it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When there is an increase in benchmark rates, the interest amount on variable rate loan increases, making the loan more expensive.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: Steps To Manage &amp; Reduce Total Loan Balances</strong></h4>



<p>There are multiple strategies which can help keep total loan balances under control and prevent any unplanned increases. The strategies include early repayment, debt consolidation, financial planning and budgeting, seeking professional financial advice, and loan forgiveness programs.</p>



<p>It is important for a borrower to understand the factors that increase total loan balances for successful financial management. It is important to take a balanced approach and make informed decisions about the rate of interest, loan tenure and repayment strategies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the disadvantages of paying loans early?</strong></h4>



<p>There can be prepayment penalties in some of the countries and it can also reduce tax benefits. These funds can also be used for other purposes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the advantages of making early loan payments?</strong></h4>



<p>The interest payments can be reduced, which can help in managing debt.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What can lead to an increase in total loan balances?</strong></h4>



<p>It has factors such as interest rates, small payments and delayed payments.</p>

<p>In an unexpected turn of events, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler misled more than a few X (formerly Twitter) users into believing he was leaving on Wednesday. But, as &#8220;And we&#8217;re not done&#8221; indicated in his last joke, Gensler only made fun of the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s initial X post, viewed over 1.1 million times, read: &#8220;It&#8217;s been an honor to serve as [SEC] Chair. Over the past 3 years, I&#8217;ve seen firsthand how the incredible staff at the SEC serve investors and issuers alike.&#8221; This led many to believe that the SEC chief was announcing his resignation.</p>



<p>Crypto traders and analysts quickly reacted to Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;legendary and respectable troll thread,&#8221; as described by crypto trader Jordan Fish, who goes by the name Cobie. Bloomberg Litigation Analyst Elliott Stein noted that &#8220;this really does feel like a resignation tweet at first, but then it&#8217;s not,&#8221; suggesting that Gensler&#8217;s actions were intentional.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Community Responds With Ratios</strong></h2>



<p>The crypto side of X got back at Gensler for his post in their way. Unofficial <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/18/pulsechain-crypto-can-plsx-token-advance-reach-bigger-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto X</a> archivist &#8220;inversebrah&#8221; noted that the platform&#8217;s crypto community &#8220;managed to score a couple of helthy [sic] ratios already,&#8221; referring to the phenomenon where a reply post garners more engagement, such as likes or shares, than the original post it replied to.</p>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s post received around 1,700 likes, but some responses have racked up more than three times that, showcasing the crypto community&#8217;s displeasure with the SEC chair&#8217;s &#8220;troll&#8221; post.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="https://w3wc.io/?no"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/freecompress-1440x90-gif-1-1.gif" alt="" style="width:1450px;height:auto"/></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Industry Concerns With Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;Regulation by Enforcement&#8221; Approach</strong></h3>



<p>The perception of Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; strategy has long been a source of concern for the cryptocurrency business. Under his direction, the number of SEC enforcement proceedings about cryptocurrency increased to 46 in 2023, double that of 2021, and hit a 10-year high.</p>



<p>Executives in the US cryptocurrency sector and a few legislators have charged that Gensler is adopting an oppressive stance. They cite the SEC&#8217;s contention that hundreds of cryptocurrencies are securities in cases brought against cryptocurrency companies.</p>



<p>However, Gensler has defended his actions, saying there is a lot of fraud and manipulation in the cryptocurrency field and that businesses should &#8220;come into compliance.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uncertain Future For Gensler&#8217;s Tenure</strong></h3>



<p>The SEC and the cryptocurrency community are at odds over Gensler&#8217;s latest post, which may have been intended as a joke. Led by Gensler, the SEC has long been concerned about investor compliance and safety with cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency society monitors Gensler closely to see if his views on the industry shift during his remaining days as SEC chair. Many people wonder whether Gensler will adhere to stringent rules or cooperate with the cryptocurrency sector to find a middle ground.</p>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s handling of the situation may significantly impact blockchain technology and cryptocurrency futures. All parties involved, including lawmakers and investors, will closely watch how Gensler strikes a balance between innovation and investor protection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Price Overview and Cautiously Optimistic Predictions</strong></h2>



<p>The price of <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/16/crypto-trader-who-made-millions-from-pepe-invests-300000-in-new-ethereum-token/">Ethereum</a> has seen a diverse set of changes recently. Within the last week, the price fell by 12.37%, and the past month saw a decrease of 15.70%. However, looking back six months, the coin has actually increased in value by 95.97%. Currently, Ethereum trades between $2771.40 and $3637.80. Its price movement appears to show a mix of both impulsive and corrective patterns, responding to various market influences.</p>



<p>Considering the current trends, Ethereum could go either way. It&#8217;s handling a level between major support at $2383.95 and resistance at $4116.75. The long-term perspective is bright, supported by a 95.97% increase in the past six months. However, the short-term outlook is more uncertain, given the recent declines. Market indicators like the RSI and MACD suggest neither strong bullish nor bearish momentum, leaving room for shifts in either direction. Investors should eye the $4116.75 and $4983.15 resistance levels for positive breaks or the $2383.95 and $1517.55 support levels for potential downturns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solana Current Price Movement Demands Cautious Approach Ahead</strong></h3>



<p>Solana&#8217;s price has seen significant changes. In the past week, Solana&#8217;s price dropped by nearly 20%. Over the past month, the decline is sharper at over 31%. However, when looking at the past six months, SOL&#8217;s value soared by roughly 453%. It&#8217;s now trading between $118.70 and $184.63. Price movements seem more corrective lately, as current trends show a pullback from earlier gains.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/28/solanas-rising-fees-drive-bonk-investors-to-mollars-presale/">Solana&#8217;s </a>current market position offers mixed signals. The nearest resistance level is at $217.68, suggesting room for growth if momentum increases. However, support at $85.82 must hold to prevent larger drops. Some analysts expect potential upsides, eyeing the second resistance at $283.61. Yet, investors must stay cautious. A fall below the second support level of $19.89 could indicate a deeper trend reversal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pyth Network (PYTH) Price Snapshot and Future Moves</strong></h3>



<p>In the past week, PYTH&#8217;s value dropped by 24.23%, indicating a downtrend. Over the past month, PYTH decreased by 46.13%, continuing the negative momentum. However, looking back six months, the coin shows a 55.10% increase. PYTH currently fluctuates between $0.44 and $0.82, hinting at uncertainty. The price action lately seems corrective with attempts to stabilize around this range.</p>



<p>PYTH&#8217;s price could head for the $1.03 resistance if it gains more support. The second resistance at $1.41 might be a target if the momentum continues. However, if the price falls, the $0.27 support level might be tested. With the RSI at 56.06 and Stochastic at 74.50, PYTH appears relatively stable. However, the lack of a strong MACD signal suggests investors might await clearer trends before taking action.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent pattern suggests that now might be a good time to look at altcoins for investment opportunities. Among them, ETH, SOL, and PYTH might not offer significant returns in the short term. However, BlastUP stands out with its solid concept and its integration with the Blast ecosystem. That indicates it could have the highest potential moving forward. As the bull run for 2024 gains momentum, BlastUP proves to be an attractive option for those looking to invest in the crypto market.</p>

<p>In a significant development, the Pi Network app has surpassed 10 million users who have verified their identities by completing the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This achievement, announced on April 16, brings the project one step closer to its goal of 15 million KYC&#8217;d users, a requirement for the launch of the project&#8217;s mainnet and the traceability of its tokens.</p>



<p>Despite this milestone, concerns remain about the value Pi Network can bring its users, as the Pi tokens cannot currently be exchanged for fiat currency on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Unique KYC Approach But An Unclear Path To Utility</strong></h2>



<p>The Pi team has touted its proprietary<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/12/24/significance-of-no-kyc-exchanges-and-existing-options-for-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> KYC</a> solution as a &#8220;unique and proprietary approach that combines machine automation and crowdsourced, hyperlocal human verification to accomplish secure, accurate, and efficient KYC.&#8221; The team claims that other Web3 services could leverage this approach for identity verification.</p>



<p>However, the need for token tradability remains a significant obstacle. According to the business analytics platform AIMultiple, Pi Network &#8220;can not yet exchange their Pi coins with fiat currency on exchanges,&#8221; suggesting that the project may not bring &#8220;any value to users&#8221; at this stage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="https://w3wc.io/?no"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/freecompress-1440x90-gif-1-1.gif" alt="" style="width:1450px;height:auto"/></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conditions For Mainnet Launch &amp; The Concerns Raised</strong></h3>



<p>The Pi Network team has announced plans to launch an &#8220;Open Network&#8221; or mainnet in 2024, provided certain conditions are met. These include developing 100 Pi apps, completing 15 million KYC verifications, and fulfilling various technological, product, business, and legal requirements.</p>



<p>AIMultiple analyst Cem Dilmegani expressed skepticism about the project&#8217;s potential benefits, stating that Pi Network &#8220;works like a direct selling or affiliate marketing system, promising future rewards to users for bringing in new users.&#8221; Dilmegani suggested that the app&#8217;s primary purpose is to drive traffic and sell advertising, with the founders being the primary beneficiaries.</p>



<p>The analyst also raised concerns about the potential for the token&#8217;s value to plummet if a mainnet is launched, as users may rapidly sell their holdings, reducing the token&#8217;s value and eliminating the incentive for users to continue logging in and clicking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pi Network&#8217;s Response &amp; Unconventional Approach</strong></h3>



<p>In response to Cointelegraph&#8217;s inquiries, a Pi Network representative acknowledged the project&#8217;s &#8220;unconventional and novel&#8221; approach to blockchain development. The representative argued that the &#8220;Enclosed Network period of mainnet&#8221; was intentionally chosen to enable utility building and KYC processing before launching the open network.</p>



<p>The representative claimed that Pi had accomplished several goals, including creating a mining app, browser, node application, testnet, mainnet, wallet, and developer platform. The representative stated that the delay in launching the open network was to ensure a &#8220;healthy launch of the Open Network&#8221; and that &#8220;anything worthwhile takes time and patience”.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Future Remains Uncertain</strong></h3>



<p>While Pi Network has achieved the significant milestone of 10 million KYC&#8217;d users, the project&#8217;s lack of token tradability and analysts&#8217; concerns about its potential value proposition raise questions about its long-term viability and adoption. As the team works towards the mainnet launch, the cryptocurrency community will closely watch to see if Pi Network can deliver on its promises and provide tangible benefits to its users.</p>
