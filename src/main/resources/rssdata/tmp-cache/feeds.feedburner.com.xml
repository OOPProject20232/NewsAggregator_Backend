										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/12-solana-meme-coin-projects-abandoned/">12 Solana Presale Meme Coin Projects &#8216;Completely Abandoned&#8217; Less than Month Later</a></p>
<p>The last 30 days saw no less than 12 Solana presale meme coin projects being “completely abandoned”. That is, according to a recent X <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1782130097895477469?s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> by popular independent blockchain detective ZachXBT.</p>
<p>Per the post, the projects had raised a combined $26.7 million, albeit through the controversial presale method. However, investigations have revealed that nearly all the tokens have plummeted since launch, with a particular one not even taking off with any token launch at all.</p>
<p>ZachXBT detailed a meme coin dubbed ‘I like this coin’ as probably the most expensive one in the Solana presale meme coin projects pack that has been abandoned. The meme coin, which sported the ticker LIKE, raised a staggering 52,220 Solana (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/solana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOL</a>) ($7.7 million at current prices) and launched with a market capitalization of $577 million on March 17. However, the meme coin shed over 90% of its value within the first eight hours of launch. As of press time, LIKE is down 83.08% from its launch price, per CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>.</p>
<p>Other than its price movement, the official X account of the LIKE coin has not posted anything since March 31. Additionally, the supposed founder pokeee.eth has not mentioned the coin in a long while as well.</p>
<p>Another notable token in the list of abandoned presale meme coin projects is MOONKE. The token launched on March 20 to a rather outsized valuation of about  $500 million. However, just as was the case with LIKE, MOONKE soon began its own downward spiral that saw it plunge over 99% from its launch price in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Notably, a project reportedly raised 4,567 SOL (over $810,000 at current prices) but never even launched a token.</p>
<h2>Meme Coin Frenzy Dying Down?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there might be a larger thing at play considering that the market’s appeal for memecoins has somewhat dwindled in recent weeks. For a better perspective, even bigger Solana-based meme coins are somehow losing their steam. For instance, Dogwifhat (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/dogwifhat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIF</a>) has lost over 45% since April 1.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, meme coins are currently a shadow of themselves. Just last month, they were doing impressive numbers to the point that market analysts started drawing comparisons to the 2017 boom era of the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO). However, one might also recall that, although hundreds of crypto projects raised millions of dollars during that period, most of them eventually failed to live up to expectations.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/60m-tether-usdt-ton-three-days/">$60 Million Tether (USDT) Already Issued on TON within Three Days after Launch</a></p>
<p>Soon after Tether announced bringing its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a> stablecoin to the TON blockchain network last week on April 19, there&#8217;s been a massive issuance happening so far. As per reports, over $60 million in USDT is already issued on TON, thus making it the 11th largest blockchain for Tether.</p>
<p>During the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai last week, Tether announced its collaboration with the TON Foundation. This allows Tether to freely mint its USDT stablecoin on the TON blockchain. Apart from USDT, Tether also launched its gold-pegged Tether Gold (XAUT) stablecoin on TON.</p>
<p>The Open Network team announced on X that cross-border payments were effortless, free, and instantaneous, likening the process to sending a text message to Telegram&#8217;s extensive user base of 900 million individuals.</p>
<p>Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, remarked in an April 21 post on X that the endeavor had seen a promising beginning, with $35 million USDT issued on TON. Nevertheless, as per the Tether Transparency <a href="https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=usdt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the authorized supply issued on TON has expanded to $60 million by 11:30 pm UTC on April 21.</p>
<h2>The Tether and TON Collaboration</h2>
<p>This collaboration between Tether and the TON blockchain will allow Telegram users to freely transfer their USDT across all platforms and almost instantly. “All you need to do is send a DM, no need for a blockchain address, and no need to download a new app,” said Telegram.</p>
<p>USDT on the TON Network comes with fully integrated on-ramps from most of the global fiat currencies. Additionally, very soon, global off-ramps will allow users to withdraw the supported fiat currencies directly to their cards or banks.</p>
<p>However, more than 50% of Tether&#8217;s circulating supply is currently on the Tron blockchain. The circulation of USDT on Ethereum has decreased to $51 billion, as more Tether is being utilized on alternative blockchains to mitigate the high network fees experienced on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>Solana stands as the third-largest network accommodating Tether, with a total issuance of $1.9 billion. Additionally, the stablecoin has been deployed on various other blockchains such as Avalanche, Omni, Cosmos, Tezos, Near, EOS, and Celo.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s share in the entire stablecoin market is currently at 69%. On the other hand, Circle, its closest rival has a market share of 21%. Tether&#8217;s expansion into the TON blockchain shows its efforts to reduce its concentration from two major players.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin race to $100K and beyond was triggered by the BTC halving event 2024 over the weekend amid heightened demand from institutional investors.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-price-66k-btc-halving-2024/">Bitcoin Price Rallies Above $66K Following BTC Halving 2024</a></p>
<p>Following Saturday’s fourth <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-halving-2024-market-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin (BTC) halving</a>, daily emissions have dropped to 450 coins, worth around $29.7 million. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has helped increase the overall demand. Combined with the recent approval of spot BTC ETFs in Hong Kong, it is safe to assume the Bitcoin bulls are in control.</p>
<p>Furthermore, almost all indicators are pointing to an inevitable new all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Network Reorganization</h2>
<p>Bitcoin miners have been preparing for the halving event in the past week, whereby the overall hash rate dropped from 700Ehash/s on April 14 to around 595Ehash/s on Monday. The continued increment in the overall mining difficulty has compelled miners from all over the world to upgrade their rigs to the latest versions.</p>
<p>Following the notable changes in Bitcoin miners, the cost of sending BTC has experienced significant volatility in the past few days. Over the weekend, overall fees paid to Bitcoin miners surged despite a decline in non-zero addresses. According to hash price data provided by mempool.space, the cost of sending <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> via a high-priority option is around $10.18, while that of a low-priority priority is about $8.7.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fees paid to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> miners have surged to 1,258 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a>, yet the creation of new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a> addresses has declined, reaching just 260,838. <a href="https://t.co/7PXARJxURw">pic.twitter.com/7PXARJxURw</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1782167174897127692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Remarkably, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have continued to hoard more coins, despite the reorganization of the mining rigs. Perhaps, Bitcoin miners are upgrading their rigs to renewable energy sources through tax cuts and credits. Moreover, the escalating Middle East crisis is set to increase the general cost of crude oil amid rising fiat inflation.</p>
<h2>What Next for BTC Price after Bitcoin Halving 2024</h2>
<p>For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, the flagship coin closed around 2021’s bull cycle top during the fourth halving event. As a result, most crypto analysts are extremely bullish on Bitcoin price and the rest of the cryptocurrency market. According to a popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin price is on the cusp of a nearly 70 percent uproar based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.</p>
<p>Notably, the crypto analyst noted that the MVRV ratio dipped below the 90-day average, which has historically been a popular buying opportunity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every time the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> MVRV Ratio falls below its 90-day average since November 2022, it signals a prime <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a> buying opportunity with an average gain of 67%! </p>
<p>This opportunity is upon us again, indicating it might be the perfect time to buy <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/nPMjF2GTpr">pic.twitter.com/nPMjF2GTpr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1782052167177654702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A similar bullish outlook was issued by a popular analyst alias MikyBull Crypto, who added that Bitcoin price must consistently close above the daily 50 Moving Average (MA). The crypto analyst further pointed out that Bitcoin price has been trading inside a horizontal consolidation, but the bulls are in control.</p>
<p>Moreover, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already broken out of a bullish flag, thus indicating more gains ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-halving-2024-market-dynamics/">Bitcoin Halving 2024: Implications for Miners and Market Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency’s Olympic-like event, the Bitcoin halving 2024 was completed at 12 a.m. GMT Saturday with immediate implications for mining companies in the ecosystem of digital assets. The halving, which is the completion of a pre-coded Bitcoin software update, occurs every four years as that is the time it takes to mine 210,000 blocks in the network.</p>
<h2>Mechanics of Bitcoin Halving</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/289921/bitcoins-fourth-halving-block-sees-additional-2-4-million-reward-paid-as-fee" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, this year’s halving, the fourth in the series appears to be from the crypto mining pool ViaBTC with an additional 37.6256 BTC ($2,401,399) &#8220;reward paid as fees of the 3,050 transactions which were included in the block&#8221;.  The previous three halving events occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>With the halving completed, the first major implication is the reduction in the mining reward by 50%. This adjustment, preordained by the code governing Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, aims to maintain a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin units and prevent inflation in the digital currency.</p>
<p>The first Bitcoin halving in 2012 rewarded miners with 50 BTC for mining a block and that constant reduction means miners will now earn 3.125 BTC per each mined block. This reduction mechanism is a constant programmed by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s anonymous founder.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin advocates view the halving as a positive catalyst for the market as it will reduce the supply of new tokens amid rising demand, analysts have suggested that the event was largely priced into the market. Despite the potential bullish impact on the market, macroeconomic factors such as signals from the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions may temper short-term bullishness toward Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Impact of Bitcoin Halving Event 2024</h2>
<p>The halving event is set to have a significant financial impact on Bitcoin mining companies, potentially wiping out billions of dollars in annual revenue. Ahead of this year’s halving, analysts at American investment banking giant<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM), highlighted challenges for miners to include production cost, decline in income, and electricity concerns.</p>
<p>Before the halving, several mining companies scouted for sustainable mining options with a Texas-based Bitcoin mining firm Giga Energy partnering with<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-miners-argentinian-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Argentinian Firms</a>. As the sector braces for consolidation, publicly-listed Bitcoin miners are expected to gain market share, leveraging greater access to funding and equity financing.</p>
<p>Past halving events have been completed without disrupting the functioning of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners will now rely increasingly on transaction fees as a source of revenue amidst dwindling rewards. There are 64 expected halving events before reaching the 21 million cap around 2140 when all Bitcoin blocks would be mined.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the price trajectory of Bitcoin has remained little unchained despite speculations and projections by different analysts before the halving. For instance, Bitwise CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitwise-ceo-bitcoin-price-halving-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunter Horsley</a> predicted the digital asset’s surge to $100,000 after the halving event. However, market watchers say it is still too early but a bullish run is anticipated in the coming days.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is pegged at $63,665.87, down by 1.61% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Tether, the prominent stablecoin issuer behind <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a>, has made an announcement regarding the integration of its stablecoins on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. At the Token2049 crypto event in Dubai, Tether&#8217;s CEO Paolo Ardoino unveiled plans to launch both the US dollar-pegged USDT and the gold-backed Tether Gold (XAUT) stablecoins on the TON network.</p>
<p>Ardonio emphasized the impact of the expansion to the blockchain network; he revealed that the launch of USDT and XAUT on TON is expected to facilitate seamless value transfers and enhance liquidity within the ecosystem. By leveraging the blockchain, users can anticipate an experience comparable to traditional financial systems, while benefiting from the advantages of decentralized cryptocurrency infrastructure.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s CEO further explained that expanding USDT and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XAUT</a> on The Open Network will help in the improvement of decentralized applications across different sectors, ultimately enhancing the functionality and utility of the TON ecosystem. It will also boost usage and seamless transaction between its telegram users.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the USDT stablecoin will go live on the blockchain on April 20th, marking a milestone in Tether&#8217;s expansion strategy. The XAUT stablecoin will follow suit, although a specific launch date was not provided. This development represents growth for XAUT, as it will now be available on a second blockchain network, extending its reach beyond <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>The decision to integrate USDT and XAUT on the TON blockchain not only signifies an important step for Tether but also bolsters TON&#8217;s standing within the cryptocurrency market. Recently, its native cryptocurrency, Toncoin, surpassed the popular meme-coin Dogecoin in market capitalization, solidifying its position as a significant player in the crypto space.</p>
<h2>Toncoin Trading Volumes and Price Surge after Announcement</h2>
<p>The integration of Tether&#8217;s stablecoins on TON promises to deliver a more streamlined financial experience for traders and investors within its ecosystem. This development has already had an impact on the market performance of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/the-open-network/">Toncoin</a>, with the announcement triggering a surge in trading volume and price appreciation.</p>
<p>In the hours following the news, Toncoin&#8217;s trading volume skyrocketed by 125%, while its price experienced a 30% increase. This uptick in trading activity and price appreciation reflects the confidence and optimism of traders and investors in the potential of the TON ecosystem, buoyed by the integration of Tether&#8217;s stablecoins. Moreover, Toncoin has risen to rank 8th in market capitalization, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The growth of the coin’s popularity and market performance has been further reinforced by a recent announcement from Telegram. The messaging app declared recently that it will officially accept Toncoin as a payment method for advertisements on its platform. This development has also been part of the driving force behind the adoption and increase of onboarding within the TON ecosystem.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hashkey-deposits-withdrawals-binance-wallets/">HashKey to Suspend Deposits and Withdrawals from Binance Wallets in May</a></p>
<p>On Friday, April 19, crypto exchange HashKey said it would stop allowing deposits and withdrawal requests from wallets hosted by rival company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>. According to a notice to investors, starting from May 10, the exchange will discontinue accepting deposits from crypto wallets belonging to Binance or whitelisted on the platform, while withdrawals will be suspended on May 17.</p>
<h2>A Change in Policy</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong-based company <a href="https://support.hashkey.com/hc/en-gb/articles/31422460616473-Notify-users-Cessation-of-VA-transfers-with-Binance-hosted-wallet-address-es" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cited</a> a &#8220;policy change&#8221; for suspending deposits and withdrawals from all Binance&#8217;s known wallet addresses.  The company did not provide details of the policy change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to a change in our policy, from May 10, 2024, 00:00 UTC+8, HashKey Exchange will cease to allow any VA deposits from Binance-hosted wallet address(es), and from May 17, 2024, 00:00 UTC+8, HashKey Exchange will cease to allow any VA withdrawals to Binance hosted wallet address(es,&#8221; wrote the company.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of specific details surrounding the policy change, HashKey assures users that the change only affects transactions involving Binance wallets. Users with other types of addresses can still deposit and withdraw funds from the exchange without restrictions.</p>
<h2>Expansion and Strategic Alliances</h2>
<p>Beyond these operational adjustments, HashKey has been making notable strides within the industry after <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hashkey-crypto-exchange-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtaining</a> regulatory approval from the Hong Kong financial regulator to offer services to retail investors in the country.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hashkey-global-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of a global digital assets trading platform for users outside Hong Kong. The newly launched exchange, HashKey Global, debuted in Bermuda after securing an operational license in the country.</p>
<p>For now, the company will only support spot trading of 21 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>), Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ether</a>), and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.</p>
<p>In the future, HashKey plans to add support for future contracts and other types of trading to the platform. Additionally, the crypto exchange will integrate staking features.</p>
<p>Sharing the news on Tuesday, the company&#8217;s COO, Livio Weng, said it intends to roll out &#8221; the world&#8217;s largest clusters of licensed exchanges within the next five years, surpassing all current regulated exchanges.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Educational Initiative for Asian Crypto Users</h2>
<p>In January 2024, HashKey <a href="https://group.hashkey.com/en/newsroom/hashkey-exchange-animoca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">partnered</a> with Animoca Brands to expand the Web3 ecosystem in Asia. The companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a strategic collaboration to introduce cooperative opportunities on digital assets for people in the region.</p>
<p>These opportunities include an educational initiative to equip crypto enthusiasts in Asia with the proper knowledge of the industry. Both companies will provide learning materials and other resources needed to achieve their goal of educating the public about crypto.</p>
<p>Additionally, HashKey and Animoca Brands will collaborate to establish strategic developments to empower the Asian crypto scene. The partnership will allow Animoca Brands to list certain types of digital asset products for trading on HashKey&#8217;s platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-ceo-richard-teng-bitcoin-halving/">Richard Teng Considers His First Bitcoin Halving as Binance CEO &#8216;Unique&#8217; Event</a></p>
<p>With the much anticipated Bitcoin halving 2024 just hours away, Binance CEO<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/richard-teng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Richard Teng</a> says the event is unique given the several positive occurrences within the cryptocurrency space. In an <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/289833/binance-ceo-richard-teng-says-this-bitcoin-halving-is-unique-due-to-recent-significant-events" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>, Teng noted that “this year’s halving is unique in that it comes amid a series of other significant events in the Bitcoin and wider crypto ecosystem.”</p>
<h2>ETF Breakthroughs Fuel Institutional Interest</h2>
<p>Some of the significant events referenced by Teng include the fact that this year&#8217;s halving is taking place after the recorded breakthrough in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has catalyzed institutional interest and participation in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Binance CEO referenced the growing activity in Layer 2 solutions and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications on the Bitcoin network. These are fueled by innovations like the Ordinals protocol and Bitcoin inscriptions.</p>
<p>Commenting on the expected price trajectory, Teng said historically, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has tended to increase in the six months following each halving event. He attributes this trend to the reduction in the supply of new coins resulting from the halving, which creates upward pressure on prices. To solidify this position, a recent Bybit report predicts Bitcoin supply scarcity after halving which may affect the price.</p>
<p>The Binance boss, however, cautioned that the extent of future growth will depend on various factors, including overall market sentiment and rates of adoption. This implies that investors must exercise caution given the volatility of the market.</p>
<p>The recent approvals of Bitcoin ETFs have already stimulated demand for BTC to expand its reach among investors. Teng believes that although these developments paint an optimistic picture for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, it&#8217;s crucial for investors, especially newcomers, to manage their expectations.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Halving 2024: Teng Urges Managed Expectations</h2>
<p>He advises against expecting immediate price shifts in response to the halving, emphasizing that its true impact will be reflected in longer-term trends relative to value, liquidity, adoption, and the acceptance of crypto as an asset class.</p>
<p>Teng’s advice is consistent with the position of analysts on the Bitcoin price which had a massive run-up ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving some hours away. After a massive 50% and more rally so far in 2024, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-halving-2024-april-17-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts</a> have advised caution to investors building fresh positions.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin halving 2024 inches closer, the rewards per block will decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for the next four years.</p>
<p>This decrease will impact the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-mining-hits-ath-btc-halving-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining difficulty</a>, which is a measure of how hard it is for miners to solve complex puzzles and find a hash lower than the target set by the system in the Proof of Work (PoW) system. Some analysts see the halving event as Bitcoin’s protocol deflationary monetary policy, contributing to its labeling as digital gold and a hedge against inflation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/merlin-chain-brc-20-merl/">Merlin Chain Launches Its Native BRC-20-based Token MERL</a></p>
<p>After months of meticulous planning and development, Merlin Chain, the largest Bitcoin-focused layer two (L2) network, has launched its native token dubbed MERL. The launch of the MERL tokens is crucial to the future growth prospects of the Merlin Chain. As the Bitcoin network prepares to undertake its fourth halving over the weekend, the Merlin Chain indicated that $MERL tokens are now available for trading on several cryptocurrency exchanges including OKX and Bitget.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MERL token will be available for trading from Friday on Hashkey Global, Gate.io, KuCoin, and ByBit among others. As a BRC-20 token, the MERL token will significantly help in unlocking the full potential of Bitcoin through revolutionary Layer-Two solutions.</p>
<p>The MERL token holders will have the ability to shape the future of the Merlin project through governance. The MERL token holders can also stake their bag to earn more rewards simultaneously ensuring the network performs well through enhanced security. The MERL token can also facilitate the payment of transaction fees within the layer three enhancements.</p>
<p>“Community members may support network operations through collator delegation or operate their collators by utilizing MERL tokens. Furthermore, MERL serves as native liquidity and collateral, enabling seamless transactions and robust lending mechanisms within the ecosystem,” the Merlin Chain team <a href="https://chainwire.org/2024/04/19/merlin-chain-launches-merl-a-major-leap-forward-in-bitcoin-layer-2-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Closer Look at Merlin Market Outlook and $MERL’s Tokenomics</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin network previously faced existential threats from the fast-growing layer one (L1) chains such as Ethereum (ETH). According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin network now has more than $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL) from crucial Web3 projects including DEXes, farming protocols, lending, and cross-chain infrastructure, among others.</p>
<p>The Merlin chain plays a crucial role in ensuring the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> network remains at the helm of the digital assets industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Merlin Chain has more than $904 million in TVL from its web3 projects led by MerlinSwap, Mage Finance, and Surg Protocol, among others. According to the Merlin chain team, the introduction of the MERL token is a pivotal milestone in enabling ecosystem development.</p>
<p>Notably, the MERL tokens have a total supply of 2.1 billion and are meticulously crafted to empower the community. The MERL private sales A and B were allocated 1.33 percent and 13.9 percent respectively. As for Private Sale A, holders will have a 6-month cliff followed by 18 months of vesting. On the other hand, MERL holders from Private Sale B will have a 12-month cliff and 36 months of vesting.</p>
<p>The participants of the Merlin’s Seal, the event that showcased the launch of Merlin Chain earlier this year, were allocated 20 percent of the total supply of MERL tokens. The Merlin chain community and ecosystem received the lion’s share of 16.57 percent and 40 percent of the total supply respectively.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/80m-crypto-fund-nickel-performance/">$80 Million Crypto Fund Nickel Tapers Investors&#8217; Expectations after Record Performance</a></p>
<p>The first quarter of 2024 has turned out to be very eventful for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and the broader crypto market, as well as for several crypto funds operating in the market. Nickel Digital Asset Management registered its best-ever quarterly performance for its $80 million Diversified Alpha fund.</p>
<p>This fund from Nickel aims to exploit market pricing inefficiencies. As per Nickel, this fund typically provides returns in the range of 15-20% annually, said Chief Executive Officer Anatoly Crachilov. However, amid strong market undercurrent in the first quarter, the Diversified Alpha fund provided a staggering 11% return.</p>
<p>Amid a strong mix of trading volumes, market volatility, and “high dispersion”, Nickel&#8217;s Diversified Alpha fund returned 5% during the month of March, explained the crypto fund in a recent presentation. However, Nickel in its presentation stated that these are one-of-its-kind returns and investors shouldn&#8217;t expect these conditions to last forever. It also noted that the high risk in the fund could lead to greater-than-expected drawdowns.</p>
<p>During the presentation, David Fauchier, Diversified Alpha’s manager, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-19/crypto-fund-nickel-digital-says-record-quarter-not-a-new-normal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Unfortunately, this is not a new normal, we won’t make 5% every month going forwards. Everything you could want in a quarter pretty much happened at some point during that quarter.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Funds Outperformed During Q1</h2>
<p>Nickel isn&#8217;t the sole crypto manager enjoying a prosperous quarter; funds managed by Brevan Howard and Pantera Capital have also capitalized on the bullish market to achieve substantial gains. During the period, Bitcoin surged by 67%, surpassing the performance of most traditional asset classes, while the broader Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index recorded a notable 57% increase.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread success seen across many crypto hedge funds, Diversified Alpha&#8217;s exceptional performance has raised some concerns, as noted by Nickel. In an interview, Michael Hall, Nickel Digital’s chief investment officer, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We don’t want to overstep expectations. We want to let them know that they can have negative months as well. That’s just being honest and straightforward.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, crypto investment products have continued to see strong inflows amid the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. This new Bitcoin investment product has registered more than $12.26 billion in net inflows so far.</p>
<p>The upcoming Bitcoin halving event will lead to a major supply squeeze. If the Bitcoin ETF demand continues to remain high, it can push the BTC price even higher.</p>

<p>Singapore's first licensed crypto payment firm, Triple-A, will soon allow merchants to be paid using PayPal's new stablecoin PYUSD.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/triple-a-integrate-paypals-pyusd/">Triple-A to Integrate PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD to Expand Crypto Payment Options</a></p>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s first licensed crypto payments company, Triple-A, aims to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-19/singapore-licensed-triple-a-to-offer-paypal-stablecoin-pyusd-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">integrate</a>­ PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin, PYUSD, within its platform. This integration, expected by June­&#8217;s conclusion in 2024, could potentially strengthen PayPal&#8217;s fledgling cryptocurre­ncy endeavor, marking a pivotal move amidst the ongoing battle for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/stablecoins-how-manage-operate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stable­coin</a> supremacy.</p>



<p>Backed by Pe­ak XV Partners, Triple-A witnesse­d remarkable growth after se­curing its license from Singapore&#8217;s Mone­tary Authority (MAS) in 2021. The company successfully tripled its payme­nt volumes betwee­n 2022 and 2023. Now, Triple-A aims to double those impre­ssive figures again by the e­nd of this year,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-triple-a-embraces-pyusd-for-broader-appeal">Triple-A Embraces PYUSD for Broader Appeal</h2>



<p>Triple-A’s decision to include PYUSD reflects a strategic shift towards a more diverse crypto ecosystem. Currently, the company mainly deals with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethe­reum</a>, and established stablecoins like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-tether-usdt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT</a> accounting for 60% of their volume. By adding PYUSD, Triple-A intends to access a pote­ntially huge user base.</p>



<p>Eric Barbier, Triple-A&#8217;s founder and CEO, highlights PayPal&#8217;s vast user network. Integrating PYUSD could significantly boost its circulation, which currently sits at a modest $200 million, compared to USDT&#8217;s stagge­ring $110 billion market capitalization.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PayPal has the firepower to make it available to a lot consumers at one go. Nobody has this power today,” said Barbier.</p>

<p>PayPal&#8217;s launch of its stablecoin, PYUSD, marke­d a significant step for major financial institutions. However, PYUSD face­s stiff competition from well-establishe­d players. Tether&#8217;s USDT holds a dominant marke­t share, and its proven track record inspires gre­ater trust among users. </p>



<p>Making things complicating for PYUSD is the ongoing re­gulatory scrutiny by the US Securities and Exchange­ Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>). In November 2023, PayPal <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-02/paypal-fields-sec-subpoena-seeking-documents-for-stablecoin-work#:~:text=PayPal%20Holdings%20Inc.,a%20regulatory%20filing%20on%20Thursday." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">received</a> a subpoena re­questing documents linked to the­ PYUSD project, creating uncertainty among PayPal’s potential users to adopt its new stablecoin.</p>

<p>Triple-A&#8217;s collaboration with a stablecoin brings an important mile­stone for digital currencies. Despite the challenges, this integration could provide authenticity and promote wider acceptance­ for the PYUSD stablecoin. This partnership shows a pivotal step in the­ global stablecoin landscape through enhance­d credibility.</p>



<p>However, Triple-A&#8217;s integration of the stable­coin signifies a pivotal advancement for PayPal&#8217;s aspirations within the­ crypto domain. As regulatory frameworks gain clarity and user adoption shifts, the upcoming months will prove pivotal in ascertaining whe­ther PYUSD can secure a niche­ within the dynamic landscape of stablecoins.</p>
