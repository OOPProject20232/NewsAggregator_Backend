<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-lawmakers-stablecoin-reform/">US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform</a></p>
<p>Efforts by the US Congress to establish a robust regulatory framework for stablecoins may have picked up new momentum. This follows after two high-ranking lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday to discuss the way forward.</p>
<p>According to the initial <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/mchenry-waters-stablecoin-reform-faa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by Punchbowl News, the meeting was held in Schumer&#8217;s office, shortly after the Japanese prime minister jointly addressed Congress the same day.</p>
<h2>Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters Keen on Stablecoin Reform</h2>
<p>Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have, so far, been very consistent in their bid to see the committee&#8217;s stablecoin bill passed into law. So much so that their efforts played a huge part in the bill&#8217;s passing at the House committee, albeit with a bipartisan vote. However, not much progress has been made since that passing, therefore blurring any hopes that the bill may be passed into law this year.</p>
<p>First off, getting a floor vote in a House where there is ongoing infighting, especially among top Republicans, would be a difficult task. Also, the Senate Banking Committee hasn&#8217;t lent any support or has shown any interest in the idea up until now.</p>
<p>Despite these potential setbacks, however, McHenry and Waters are not willing to give up just yet. According to sources familiar with what was discussed on Thursday, the duo is looking to tie the stablecoin bill to a must-move item, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending bill.</p>
<p>For McHenry, getting his panel&#8217;s stablecoin bill passed for President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> to sign into law is one of his priorities before retiring from Congress later this year. With Schumer now in the picture, there is a glimmer of hope that legislation that will guide issuers of stablecoins may just see the light of day.</p>
<p>As of publication, efforts to reach out to McHenry and Waters for commentary have not yet yielded any results.</p>
<h2>Call for Cooperation</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a wake-up call for lawmakers around the world. It is an encouragement for them to double their efforts in advancing the stablecoin reform agenda.</p>
<p>However, as the debate surrounding stablecoin regulation continues to gain traction, it will all boil down to the collective resolve of lawmakers to address regulatory uncertainties for this fast-evolving digital economy to attain success in the future.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/21000-bitcoin-options-btc-price-70000/">21,000 Bitcoin Options Set to Expire Today, Can BTC Price Hold $70,000?</a></p>
<p>Throughout this week, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) has shown strong volatility as we stare at Friday&#8217;s Bitcoin options expiry. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6% up on the weekly chart at $70,922 with a market cap of $1.4 trillion.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://twitter.com/GreeksLive/status/1778600935947911453" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> from Greeks.live, a staggering 21,000 Bitcoin options are set to expire having a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put call ratio of 0.62. The max pain point for the expiry currently stands at $69,000.</p>
<p>With the US CPI data and inflation coming higher than expected, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced stronger volatility. On the other hand, the implied volatility has declined which means that in the case of volatile price movements, the BTC price can tank further under $70,000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Greeks.live data shows that the sell calls have dominated the Bitcoin trade over the past month and the optimism around Bitcoin halving seems to be waning. Also, with the slowdown in the Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC lacks enough impetus to continue with its rally ahead.</p>
<p>As of now, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been largely consolidating in a tight range between $69,000-$71,000. Analysts believe that it could continue to consolidate up to halving without showing any major price movements.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $71,000</h2>
<p>Over the last fortnight, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has faced a significant struggle moving past $71,000, clearly hinting at a strong bearish grip in the market. Critics speculate that the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s recent decline from its peak of 5265 on March 28 could foreshadow an economic downturn. Given Bitcoin&#8217;s strong correlation with stocks, which surpassed 80% last month, its price might initially decline if market troubles persist.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the BTC futures market continues to show signs of neutrality highlighting a healthy demand for leverage calls in comparison to the situation in March-end. However, any kind of excessive leverage remains a valid concern with the Bitcoin futures open interest currently standing at $34.3 billion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On-chain data provider Santiment reports that if the Bitcoin price moves towards its all-time high levels soon, a surge in the Bitcoin halving mentions will serve as a FOMO indicator, hinting at a temporary peak. On the other hand, if the BTC price starts to retrace toward $67,000 amid the surge in halving discussions, it could be a sign of FUD presenting strong buying opportunities.</p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitgets-q1-2024-report-surge-bgb/">Bitget&#8217;s Q1 2024 Report Reveals 100% Surge in Transactions Volume, While BGB Soars 80%</a></p>

<p>Bitget, a major crypto e­xchange and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a> firm, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/bitget-q1-2024-report-volume-surges-over-100-and-bgb-token-breaks-all-time-high-302114250.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> its Q1 2024 Transparency Report, showing incredible growth and de­dication to a thriving crypto community. Trading volumes for spot and futures surged 100% compare­d to the prior quarter, while Bitge­t&#8217;s native BGB token value soare­d 80% during Q1 2024, solidifying Bitget&#8217;s position as a major player in the crypto.</p>



<p>The futures trading volume­ reached US$1.4 trillion, signifying a substantial 146% surge compared to Q4 2023. Moreover, the spot trading witnessed an equally re­markable performance, surpassing US$160 billion, re­presenting a 113% increase­. Consequently, Bitget&#8217;s marke­t share in the derivative­s market experie­nced a notable 2.4% growth in March 2024.</p>



<p>The success wasn&#8217;t limited to trading activity. Bitge­t witnessed a remarkable­ surge in its user base, soaring to e­ncompass over 25 million individuals worldwide. This growth unde­rscores the platform&#8217;s growing appeal­ and widespread adoption within the crypto community.</p>



<h2 id="h-bitget-s-bgb-token-grows-434-since-2023" class="wp-block-heading">Bitget&#8217;s BGB Token Grows 434% Since 2023</h2>



<p>Bitget’s native token BGB dramatically soared reaching $1 in February, and had a huge increase in market cap to reach $ 1.5 billion. The superlative performance of BGB has yielded an increase of 434% since the year started, thus outperforming Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a>) and emerging as one of the top performers on the CEX token market.</p>



<p>Bitget’s growth is not limited to trading volumes, and its proactive listing approach that has led to the introduction of 186 additional tokens expanded its portfolio to over 750 tokens and 820 spot trading pairs. Some tokens, such as XAI, GPT, and PIXEL, experienced an appreciable increase in price, surpassing an astonishing high of 3000%.</p>



<p>Apart from its core products, Bitget places emphasis on its role in society and the need to have a vibrant community. Among these are publishing a gender imbalance <a href="https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitget-report-the-gender-gap-in-blockchain-startup-funding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, unveiling Blockchain4Her project worth $10 million as well as electing three experts from the industry as brand representatives. </p>



<p>Furthermore, Bitget also embraces various charitable activities such as providing assistance to Club Caacupé, a youth development organization by organizing fundraising activities together with giving away all SLERF trading fees towards its rebuilding plan.</p>



<h2 id="h-bitget-eyes-global-expansion" class="wp-block-heading">Bitget Eyes Global Expansion</h2>



<p>Bitget appointed Vugar Usi Zade and Alvin Kan to further prope­l its global expansion and innovation. The­y will serve as Chief Ope­rations Officers, leading Bitget and Bitge­t Wallet, respective­ly. With their extensive­ expertise and strate­gic insights, these new le­aders will fortify Bitget&#8217;s trajectory towards continue­d success and growth in the future.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Gracy Chen, the Managing Director of Bitge­t, highlights the organization&#8217;s de­dication to enhancing its spot market offerings and making substantial contributions to the broader cryptocurrency market. </p>



<p>“We aim not only to bolster our market position but also to contribute tremendously to the broader crypto ecosystem, supporting startups with high potential to grow,” said Chen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kucoin-research-1-6b-crypto-projects-march/">KuCoin Research: Institutional Investors Poured $1.6B on 180 Crypto Projects in March </a></p>
<p>KuCoin research, the analytics arm of the crypto exchange, has released its monthly <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsWMWFs5xHRFRGHTI8v6rDujmDrKs8Kv/view" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> on market trends, sharing insights into the industry&#8217;s behavior in the past month. According to the report, the number of financing in the digital asset space increased by 50% in March to reach $1.6 million compared to February.</p>
<p>The month witnessed a resurgence in institutional investments, coinciding with Bitcoin&#8217;s climb to a new all-time high above $73,000 after a two-year downturn. Pushed by positive market sentiments, investors directed funds into 180 crypto projects across various sectors.</p>
<h2>Market Dynamics and Investment Trends</h2>
<p>The KuCoin research found a continuous growth trend in both the number and scale of investment and financing projects compared to the previous year. The company said the growth signals a robust revival in the primary investment market within the current crypto economy.</p>
<p>While the financing scale between $10 and $100 million notably increased from 16.6% in February to 28.81% in March, seed-stage financing projects saw a slight decline from 40.86% to 37.8%.</p>
<p>Despite this increase, strategic stage financing projects surged to 22.83% from 16.13%.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Performance and Investor Focus</h2>
<p>In terms of blockchain performance, Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" rel="">ETH</a>), Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>), and Polygon (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MATIC</a>) projects attracted substantial investor attention, especially following Ethereum&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solutions after the Dencun upgrade.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin and Polygon remained strong, Ethereum, through its layer-2 scaling solutions, topped the chart after the Dencun upgrade. For active venture capital companies participating in the crypto industry, OKX Ventures leads the way, emerging as the leader among other investors. The company participated in a total of 20 projects in March, followed by MH and Waterdrip.</p>
<p>When it comes to the top ten sectors that received significant attention from venture capital, key sectors such as Infrastructure (Infra), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Games dominated venture capital investments. In March, investment institutions favored themes revolving around AI, DEX, and Lending projects.</p>
<h2>Market Momentum and Future Outlook</h2>
<p>March showcased a bullish trend for the entire crypto market, particularly propelled by Bitcoin&#8217;s surge to new heights.</p>
<p>On March 12, Bitcoin&#8217;s spot ETF <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-418m-inflows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded</a> a new historical high for single-day net inflows, reaching $1.05 billion. With the Bitcoin ETF&#8217;s historical inflow, the options and futures market saw significant Open Interest (OI) growth, reflecting an increased capital influx.</p>
<p>However, a significant delivery in the options market on March 29 caused the OI to slide. KuCoin research anticipates continued capital inflow, barring negative market developments and sustaining the current positive momentum.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/trust-wallet-mev-protection/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/trust-wallet-mev-protection/">Trust Wallet Introduces MEV Protection for Secure and Fair Crypto Transactions</a></p>
<p>Trust Wallet, a leading crypto wallet and Web3 gateway with over 80 million users, has made an advancement by <a href="https://trustwallet.com/blog/introducing-mev-protection-secure-your-swaps-with-trust-wallet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">introducing</a> Miner Extractable Value (MEV) Protection. This new feature ensures the security and fairness of crypto transactions. The implementation of this solution is a direct response to user complaints about technical issues and hacking incidents, showing the wallet’s commitment to improving the overall crypto experience for its large user base.</p>
<p>MEV Protection coincides with an upgrade to Trust Wallet&#8217;s Swaps feature, which now allows seamless exchanges with over 1 million token pairs across multiple networks and providers. This dual advancement showcases its dedication to facilitating secure swaps in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Understanding MEV and Its Impact</h2>
<p>Miner Extractable Value is a concept in the blockchain industry that refers to the potential profit miners, validators, and other participants can gain by manipulating the order, censorship, or insertion of transactions within a block. These attacks exploit this vulnerability, enabling malicious actors to manipulate transaction orders for personal gain. They result in increased slippage, less favorable execution prices, and an unfair trading experience for regular users.</p>
<h2>MEV Protection: A Comprehensive Solution</h2>
<p>The introduction of MEV Protection is aimed at countering this attack. The security measure safeguards users&#8217; swaps from front-running and sandwich attacks, which are common tactics used by bad actors in the crypto space. Front-running involves exploiting knowledge of a pending transaction to execute a similar transaction before it, thereby manipulating the market price. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, require trapping a legitimate transaction between two malicious ones to profit from price slippage.</p>
<p>The MEV protocol ensures that users receive fair market prices for their swaps, protecting them from the risk of paying more or receiving less than the prevailing market rate. This feature benefits both experienced traders and those new to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/category/crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto</a>, creating a safer and more secure environment for all swap participants.</p>
<h2>Easy Access to MEV Protection</h2>
<p>Accessing this new feature is a simple process. Users can select the swap option from the bottom menu, click on the settings button in the top right corner, and enable the MEV protection features. This will also make it available on all devices connected to the account, ensuring a seamless and secure trading experience and automatically opting users in for an additional layer of security from the beginning. This approach further showcases its commitment to transparency and providing a user-focused Web3 experience.</p>
<p>In addition, the crypto wallet further places a strong emphasis on user education and empowerment, ensuring that its community is well-informed about the security measures that it has put in place. The introduction of this new development has received praise from the Trust Wallet community.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s awesome! Congratulations on adding MEV Protection. Now we can swap with peace of mind. Great move, Trust Wallet!&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/RichQuack/status/1778344768004866214" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> X user RichQuack with over 340,000 followers.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitrace-hong-kong-police-crypto-funds/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitrace-hong-kong-police-crypto-funds/">Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training</a></p>
<p>Bitrace, a blockchain data analysis company, has provided on-chain fund tracking training to officers of the Hong Kong Police Force. The training, done as part of the firm’s Corporate Social Responsibility is to help bolster law enforcement’s understanding of blockchain technology, particularly as Hong Kong continues its push as the new darling of the crypto economy.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://mirror.xyz/media.bitrace.eth/Bfk3_ylRgC4qpFZs4lWaTvbft7Q28jPJkfrViBA2-FA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">local media source</a>, the training sessions were conducted for the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) and Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB).</p>
<h2>Web3 Companies and Authorities Jointly Fight Crypto Crimes</h2>
<p>With the increasing prominence of Hong Kong in the cryptocurrency space, Bitrace CEO Isabel says it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between Web3 companies and the authorities. She maintains that the training is targeted at equipping law enforcement officers with the necessary skills and knowledge to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes effectively.</p>
<p>Isabel, while delivering a comprehensive overview of crypto-assets application in cybercrime, highlighted some challenges including the fact that regulatory agencies lag behind in understanding crypto-criminal methods. Many crypto crime fighters do not also know that encrypted crime investigation is usually multi-layered, and the low efficiency of collaboration among stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Bitrace CEO insisted that it is necessary to protect the security of users&#8217; funds and foster a healthier and safer Web3 environment by strengthening partnerships with regulatory agencies. The capacity-building sessions delved into various aspects of crypto-related crimes such as online gambling, illicit asset trading, money laundering, and fraud. Last year, Anatoly Legkodymov, the former CEO of Bitzlato, pleaded guilty to facilitating the laundering of illicit funds totaling $700 million.</p>
<p>Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace&#8217;s technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities. Real-life case studies were analyzed to provide insights into encryption crime methods and the flow of criminal funds on the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Bitrace Capabilities Beyond Hong Kong Police Training</h2>
<p>Besides the training, Bitrace also engaged in discussions with the Commercial Crimes Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau. The aim is to foster collaboration between regulatory agencies and Web3 companies.</p>
<p>Prior to the training, the regulatory authorities have tried to keep the space sane. For instance, last month, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong had flagged suspected <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-sfc-hkcexp-crypto-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto fraud</a> with HKCEXP to prevent users from falling victim to scams.</p>
<p>Analysts say Bitrace is well suited to provide capacity building for Hong Kong police as it has advanced analytics capabilities, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms and has enabled the accumulation of a vast address tag library. This library includes entity tags such as DeFi platforms, mining pools, and digital asset exchanges, as well as risk behavior tags like fraud, money laundering, and illegal online gambling.</p>
<p>Thus, by utilizing this technology, regulatory authorities can swiftly identify suspicious addresses and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto transactions. Industry watchers hope that the collaboration addresses the challenges posed by crypto-related crimes. This is paramount as the Hong Kong <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-sfc-spot-bitcoin-etf-april-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFC is set to green light spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the region anything from now.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korea-bitcoin-crypto-markets/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korea-bitcoin-crypto-markets/">South Korea’s Opposition Party Wins Parliamentary Vote, What It Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Markets</a></p>
<p>South Korea’s liberal opposition party, Democratic Party (DPK), has won a landslide majority in the parliamentary. While the outcome did not guarantee an outright ouster of the current sitting president, Yoon Suk Yeol, all indicators point to a one-term tenure ending in three years. Furthermore, the opposition’s landslide victory has led to the resignation of Han Dong-hoon and Han Duck-soo as the party leader of the People Power Party (PPP) and Prime Minister respectively.</p>
<p>Notably, South Korea’s opposition parties jointly won 192 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. If the opposition parties managed to reach 200 seats, the current president would be impeached. Nonetheless, the remaining three years for the current president will be extremely difficult with the opposition controlling the National Assembly.</p>
<h2>What South Korea’s Opposition Win Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>South Korea is one of the leading developed countries that have significantly adopted the web3 industry and digital assets. The high adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets in South Korea, amounting to over 6 million people, had a significant influence in the just concluded parliamentary election.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both sides of the political aisle had promised reward packages for the cryptocurrency industry if elected in the country’s National Assembly.</p>
<p>On one side, the PPP had vowed to delay a digital asset tax and allow investors to thrive in the nascent sector. On the other hand, the Democratic Party pledged to allow South Korean investors to tap into spot Bitcoin ETFs both locally and overseas.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea&#39;s pro-<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> Democratic Party has won the national election to form government.</p>
<p>DP: &quot;We&#39;re going to allow the ETFs, domestic or overseas.&quot;  </p>
<p>More than 6 million South Koreans — over 10% of the population own Bitcoin or crypto.</p>
<p>&mdash; Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1778345512283824418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notably, the DP party will need to overhaul the country’s securities regulator that previously indicated that brokering spot BTC ETFs violates the law. The arguments follow data that shows that South Korean investors purchased more than $200 million of MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR). Additionally, more investors from South Korea have been trading crypto futures ETFs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it will remain a game of waiting to see if the president will bend to the National Assembly’s rules and vice versa.</p>
<h2>Market Picture</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market remains in a macro bullish outlook with the Bitcoin halving 2024 about 9 days from happening. The fact that the United States has struggled to tame the dollar inflation is a direct reflection of the global economic situation. Furthermore, some countries led by El Salvador have been purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and global geopolitical instability.</p>
<p>As Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/biden-rate-cuts-bitcoin-btc-70000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously noted</a>, the United States Federal Reserve only remains optimistic that interest rate cuts will take place later this year amid the upcoming general elections. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price is attempting to rally beyond the resistance range between $71k and $72k.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cheqd-andromeda-devolved-ai/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cheqd-andromeda-devolved-ai/">cheqd Partners with Andromeda and Devolved AI to Enhance Trusted Data Markets</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cheqd.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cheqd</a>, a privacy-preserving payment and credential network, announced a strategic partnership with Andromeda Protocol and <a href="https://devolvedai.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Devolved AI</a> to increase the growth of Trusted Data Markets.</p>
<h2>cheqd Building a Foundation for Trusted Data Economies</h2>
<p>With the partnership, cheqd is creating the groundwork for a Trusted Data ecosystem that will enable users to manage their data while protecting their privacy in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a>. In Trusted Data Markets, organizations issue verifiable data to holders, who actively exchange it with interested parties known as “Verifiers” who desire to validate the data.</p>
<p>The cheqd platform through its public permissionless network is developing the first payment rails, Decentralized Identities (DIDs), governance frameworks to support Trusted Data, and flexible commercial models. At the heart of the cheqd platform is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Blockchain technology, expected to offer the framework and trust layer required to support Trusted Data marketplaces.</p>
<p>According to the details of the partnership, <a href="https://www.andromedaprotocol.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Andromeda</a>, which acts as an application&#8217;s platform layer, will help build cheqd’s Web3 developer community by providing access to secure, user-controlled data solutions.</p>
<p>Notably, Andromeda will help provide the tools aOS developers require to create high-level Decentralized Applications (dApps) with improved data management and trust, resulting in more satisfying, user-centric experiences. The partnership will also be beneficial to Andromeda as it is expected to spur growth and innovation in the ecosystem, allowing for the rapid proliferation of decentralized networks.</p>
<h2>cheqd to Enhance AI Trust</h2>
<p>cheqd will be equally crucial in driving Devolved AI&#8217;s objective to democratize the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem. Devolved AI is a  Layer-1 blockchain committed to encouraging global participation in the creation of Athena LLM, an advanced Large Language Model.</p>
<p>The platform has a central goal of redefining the relationship between AI and humanity, thus equipping individuals with the ability to vote, earn rewards and play a role in the future of AI technology.</p>
<p>Through the partnership with cheqd, Devolved AI will leverage cheqd’s innovations in DIDs and Trusted Data Markets to develop a unique decentralized reputation system that rewards contributors. Accordingly, Devolved AI can ensure that its users have complete control over their digital personalities, allowing them to engage in a trusted manner without disclosing their identities.</p>
<p>It is important to note that cheqd’s Trusted Data Markets will be critical in ensuring the quality and reliability of the data used to train its AI. This will make certain it meets the demand for intelligent models that are completely ethical and transparent. Last year, cheqd <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cheqd-creds-security-solution-web3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> an unique innovation called Creds, which serves as a private and secure platform that transforms how trust is built and maintained in the realm of AI.</p>
<p>Crucially, Devolved AI’s decentralized reputation system will be developed on top of cheqd’s architecture to review how credibility in Web3 is established and maintained. Overall, Devolved AI is establishing an ecosystem for artificial intelligence development in which trust will be one of the most valuable credentials in a community that values honesty.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/thailand-crypto-p2p-trading-regulations/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/thailand-crypto-p2p-trading-regulations/">Thailand Authorities Target Crypto Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading Regulations to Combat Online Fraud</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/thailand-crypto-p2p-trading-regulations/">Thailand Authorities Target Crypto Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading Regulations to Combat Online Fraud</a></p>
<p>Authorities in Thailand are targeting peer-to-peer (P2P) trading as part of broader efforts to tackle online fraud in the country. In a meeting, several state agencies called for regulating P2P crypto trading and digital asset purchases to protect people from financial loss.</p>
<h2>Thailand to Prevent Scammers from Cleaning Money via P2P Trades</h2>
<p>In attendance were representatives from several agencies, including the Defense Ministry, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, the Royal Thai Police, and the Bank of Thailand. Others were the Department of Special Investigation, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Thai Bankers’ Association, the Interior Ministry, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, and the Department of Special Investigation.</p>
<p>The meeting was led by the Thai Minister for Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Jantararuangthong. The participants met following a recent order from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. The Prime Minister gave agencies 30 days to disclose plans to crack down on growing online fraud.</p>
<p>According to a Bangkok Post <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2774524/online-scam-crackdown-focuses-on-p2p-crypto-channel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">publication</a>, online scammers take the proceeds from their illicit activities and pass them through crypto exchanges and trading platforms via P2P trading. This helps to minimize the risk of being traced, making it difficult for authorities to find and prosecute scammers.</p>
<p>According to Prasert’s ministry, 80% of the 100 million baht ($2.7 million) worth of daily fraud recorded in Thailand passes through P2P channels. The ministry believes this is an easy way for fraudsters to clean the money because these fund transfers are unregulated. The Minister tasked the SEC with finding ways to regulate P2P trades to prevent money laundering.</p>
<h2>No VAT for Crypto in Thailand</h2>
<p>According to the SEC, there are 2 million crypto accounts held by individuals in Thailand. Current regulations focus on regulating crypto trading, especially targeting unauthorized exchanges. The new effort is to widen regulatory activities to ensure that P2P trading is scrutinized as part of current efforts. However, Prasert assures that registered platforms will not be targeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The move to regulate the P2P platform would not affect cryptocurrency traders on authorized exchanges.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Minister plans to offer a regulation scheme to the Prime Minister if the SEC cannot modify existing regulations. In addition to P2P trading, the agencies also hope to tackle online fraud and call center scams.</p>
<p>Thailand is working on establishing the country as a digital asset hub. In February, the Ministry of Finance <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/thailand-crypto-trading-vat-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excluded</a> crypto trading from value-added tax (VAT) requirements to encourage the use of digital assets. According to the Finance Minister’s secretary, Paopoom Rojanasakul, the vision is to support crypto adoption to drive the digital economy. The ministry waived the 7% tax earlier imposed on the crypto sector, effective January 1. Initially, for authorized crypto exchanges, the waiver now extends to all brokers and dealers under the SEC’s purview.</p>
<p>For regulations, the SEC and Finance Ministry are currently modifying the country’s 2019 Securities and Exchange Act. The agencies want to better regulate crypto use and investment by classifying digital investment tokens as securities.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mempool-developer-bitcoin-layer-2-solutions/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mempool-developer-bitcoin-layer-2-solutions/">Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) has faced some challenges in terms of scalability, leading to a pursuit of solutions to improve its ability to process transactions. In the bid to propose solutions, Layer 2 (L2) technologies have emerged, offering the potential to ease the strain on the base layer and unlock new possibilities for the digital asset. However, the path to scalability has sparked a divisive debate within the crypto community, with supporters expressing their concerns about the advantages and potential risks of various L2 implementations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If your Bitcoin L2 doesn&#39;t support unilateral exit, that&#39;s not your L2 that&#39;s a multisig. <a href="https://t.co/Ors4ZvpmjX">pic.twitter.com/Ors4ZvpmjX</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A notable critic is the developer of Mempool, Mononaut, who has expressed their <a href="https://x.com/mononautical/status/1777876859868590106" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">concerns</a> about various BTC L2 solutions. Their critique covers a range of factors, including the involvement of venture capital (VC) investors and the issuance of separate tokens, as well as the centralized or federated structures that underpin some of these initiatives.</p>
<p>The developer’s concerns also extend to projects that offer reciprocal rewards based on user deposits, which they liken to pyramid schemes, and those that incentivize long-term lockups of coins, drawing comparisons to offerings like Hex. Additionally, he was skeptical of L2 platforms that lack comprehensive technical documentation, dismissing them as mere copies of the infamous Bitconnect scheme with a superficial disguise. In a post on X, they said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If your Bitcoin L2 has no whitepaper or technical details, only 20 pages of documentation on how to deposit BTC and calculate your future yield, that&#8217;s not your L2 that&#8217;s Bitconnect wearing a false moustache.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing these concerns is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/cardano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA</a>), who has openly questioned the effectiveness of Bitcoin&#8217;s L2 solutions <a href="https://x.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1754158382955815339" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">compared</a> to the scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson argues that BTC&#8217;s inherent design limitations make it incredibly challenging to implement additional functionality, often requiring the deployment of centralized or federated infrastructures &#8211; a compromise that, in his opinion, undermines the fundamental principles of the coin.</p>
<h2>The Optimist&#8217;s Perspective: Envisioning Bitcoin&#8217;s L2-Driven Future</h2>
<p>However, not all voices in the cryptosphere share this skepticism. Proponents of L2 technologies, like Yago, an X user with over twenty thousand followers, <a href="https://x.com/EdanYago/status/1777303579172143152" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">remain</a> steadfast in his belief that these solutions will propel BTC to new heights, making it a cornerstone of modern civilization. He envisions a future where BTC becomes intertwined with various aspects of our lives, driven by the asset&#8217;s increasing value as L2 implementations unlock new use cases and efficiencies.</p>
<p>It is evident that both sides of the argument present strong and convincing opinions, stating the challenge of promoting new ideas while remaining true to the coin’s commitment to decentralization, which has been the foundation of its success. The Layer 2 solutions offer the potential for the future of BTC by creating opportunities as the Bitcoin community continues to grow and generate innovative ideas.</p>
<p>In recent times, we have witnessed a series of developments that have transformed the crypto space, such as AI-enhanced gaming in the crypto space and improved digital wallets that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and additional features for managing digital assets. Nevertheless, the full impact of these changes is still unknown due to their rapid pace of occurrence.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-luno-license-south-africa/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
