<p><strong>Ripple&#8217;s (XRP) price will likely make its way out of the potential bearishness it is doomed to witness.</strong></p>



<p>This will likely occur with the help of Bitcoin, which is expected to rise ahead of the halving event this month.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-has-the-potential-to-rally">Ripple Has the Potential to Rally.</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-crypto-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price will follow the cues</a> of the biggest cryptocurrency on the planet, Bitcoin. This is because the latter is due for a major rally due to the halving event set to occur towards the end of this month.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin price increases, the highly correlated assets will also probably take on the bullishness and witness an increase. XRP is among those altcoins, as it could potentially rally as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/V03NWxWS-850x363.png" alt="XRP correlation to Bitcoin.

<p>The chances of this happening within the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-crypto-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple network are also high</a>, given there is room for further profits. The overall supply-bearing gains at the moment are at 83%, far lower than the threshold of the conditions forming a market top.</p>

<p>Only when an asset&#8217;s 95% of the circulating supply is in profit is a market top formed; otherwise, the potential for a rally is high.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-850x288.png" alt="XRP Supply in Profit." class="wp-image-500394" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">XRP Supply in Profit.

<p> Thus, the XRP price could benefit from these conditions to chart gains in the coming days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-prediction-a-bullish-breakout">XRP Price Prediction: A Bullish Breakout</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-correction-downtrend-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price trading at $0.5951</a> is currently attempting to stay above the upper trend line of the descending triangle pattern the altcoin was stuck in. Since last month, the descending triangle pattern is a bearish chart formation. Characterized by a flat support level and declining resistance, it indicates a potential continuation of a downtrend when the price breaks below the support level.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-price-correction-looms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price managed to break out of it</a>, nearly securing $0.6064 as a support floor. This coincides with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement of $0.8199 to $0.4744. Should the Ripple token manage to reclaim 38.2% Fib, it could rally towards $0.6500.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/7LgPZtxK-850x363.png" alt="XRP/USDT 12-hour chart.

<p>But if the altcoin falls back into the bearish pattern, it will fall through the lower trend line. This would send it to the 23.6% Fib level marked at $0.5559, invalidating the bearish thesis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Polygon (MATIC) price is facing potential correction owing to growing bearishness among investors.</strong></p>



<p>This sentiment has intensified to the point where even whales have opted to reduce their holdings and book profits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polygon-investors-move-to-sell">Polygon Investors Move to Sell</h2>



<p>MATIC price is flashing a bearish signal, and investors react to it rather strongly. This is evident from the substantial drop in network growth. This indicator measures the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network, indicating the overall traction of the project among investors.</p>

<p>At the moment, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-matic-network-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon&#8217;s network growth</a> is at a seven-month low, which means that MATIC&#8217;s adoption is taking a massive hit.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not just potential investors exhibiting skepticism but also existing MATIC holders. Large wallet holders are dumping their holdings, with over 19 million MATIC worth over $16 million moved to exchanges. Most of these addresses are whales holding between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of MATIC.</p>

<p>The decline in these investors&#8217; supply is considered a major signal as any potential for recovery becomes invalidated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matic-price-prediction-look-out-for-a-drop">MATIC Price Prediction: Look out for a Drop</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-matic-breakout-1-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MATIC price is currently witnessing a consistent drawdown</a>, bringing it closer to the critical support of $0.7489. Given the aforementioned market cues, it is likely that the Polygon native token will lose this support.</p>



<p>Consequently, MATIC price would fall by 11.63% to test the support of $0.7422. If the altcoin falls below it, the support level of $0.7000 will be tested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5ENSmPBU-850x363.png" alt="MATIC/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>However, the DeFi token is also in a falling wedge, which could reverse the outcome. A falling wedge is a bullish chart pattern characterized by declining price highs and lows, converging towards a narrower range, typically indicating a potential reversal to the upside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In a landmark legal action, former Amazon engineer Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to three years in prison for orchestrating hacks on two DeFi cryptocurrency exchanges, resulting in over $12 million theft. </strong></p>



<p>US District Judge Victor Marrero handed down the sentence, marking a significant milestone in crypto-related law enforcement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-defi-hacker-sentenced-to-3-years-in-prison">DeFi Hacker Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison</h2>



<p>Shakeeb Ahmed utilized his extensive knowledge in reverse engineering and blockchain audits to manipulate smart contracts on the exchanges. US Attorney Damian Williams <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-security-engineer-sentenced-three-years-prison-hacking-two-decentralized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">states</a> this case represents the first-ever conviction for hacking a smart contract. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison — and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto — is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks,&#8221; Williams emphasized.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On July 2 and 3, 2022, Ahmed targeted the first exchange by injecting fake pricing data, generating $9 million in inflated fees, which he then illicitly withdrew. In a subsequent communication with the exchange, Ahmed agreed to return the stolen funds except for $1.5 million, provided the exchange did not report the attack to law enforcement.</p>



<p>A few weeks later, on July 28, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nirvana-finance-hacker-surrenders-millions-pleading-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in Nirvana</a> Finance’s smart contracts. This second attack drained Nirvana of approximately $3.6 million, nearly all its funds, forcing the platform to shut down. Ahmed declined Nirvana&#8217;s substantial bug bounty offer, opting to keep the stolen assets.</p>

<p>Ahmed engaged in sophisticated laundering techniques to obscure the origins of the stolen funds. These included swapping tokens across blockchains, converting assets into the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/monero-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">untraceable crypto Monero</a>, and utilizing overseas exchanges and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-bitcoin-mixers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency mixers</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to prison time, the court has ordered Ahmed to forfeit around $12.3 million in stolen assets. He must also pay restitution exceeding $5 million to the affected exchanges. He will also undergo three years of supervised release post-incarceration.</p>

<p>Investors are not particularly optimistic either, which could result in LINK failing any potential recovery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chainlink-investors-could-sell">Chainlink Investors Could Sell</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price is falling lower</a> daily due to broader market conditions. Such bearish market conditions are sometimes flipped into bullish ones by the activity of the investors. However, this is not the case with LINK.</p>



<p>Active addresses, i.e., addresses conducting transactions on the network, have hit a new low after declining for the past couple of days. In the last 24 hours, less than 3,500 investors have participated in Chainlink, the lowest figure since October 2023.</p>

<p>This shows that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-etf-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LINK holders are not particularly optimistic</a> at the moment, extending their bearish behavior.</p>

<p>Furthermore, daily price active addresses divergence, which flashes a sell signal at the time of writing. During instances when the price stays strong and participation declines, selling becomes highly probable.</p>

<p>Additionally, this is the strongest sell signal noticed in the past year, which directly hints at the potential selling that is about to come.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-token-profit-on-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s current price</a> is set to see a considerable drawdown owing to the descending triangle pattern it is stuck in.

<p>Based on this pattern, the downside target for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-link-price-correction-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price is $11.98</a>, which would mark an almost 30% correction for the investors.</p>

<p>However, halving induces bullishness in the market, and LINK follows the cue, so it could break out of the pattern. This would rally towards $18.73 and beyond, invalidating the bearish cues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In a stunning reversal of fortune, the crypto market saw a significant downturn, culminating in a whopping $864.24 million worth of liquidations. </strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-864-24-million-in-crypto-liquidations">$864.24 Million in Crypto Liquidations</h2>



<p>Bitcoin led the correction, falling 7% to a weekly low of $65,214. This downturn marks its lowest valuation since April 5. </p>



<p>The ripple effects resonated across the board. Even smaller cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/solana-platforms-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/doge-dogecoin-price-prediction-2019-2020-5-years-updated-04-28-19-doge-usd-reaches-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin</a> experienced steeper declines of around 18% and 19%, respectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="476" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-850x476.png" alt="Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin Price Performance" class="wp-image-500469" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-850x476.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-360x201.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-768x430.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-1536x860.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-2048x1146.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOGEUSD_2024-04-12_21-39-59-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin Price Performance. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The downturn primarily stems from the liquidations of bullish bets on crypto. </p>



<p>In the past 24 hours alone, data from Coinglass <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indicates</a> that approximately $775.40 million was cleared from long positions in derivatives markets. Short positions were not spared either, with around $89.89 million being liquidated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="348" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM-850x348.png" alt="Total Crypto Liquidations" class="wp-image-500468" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM-850x348.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM-360x147.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM-768x314.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM-1536x628.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM-150x61.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-9.38.17-PM.png 1922w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Total Crypto Liquidations. Source: <a href="https://coinglass.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coinglass</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This sudden market shift contrasts sharply with the recent uptrend fueled partly by anticipation surrounding the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin halving</a> event—a key update in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s code meant to decrease its supply. </p>



<p>Despite the current crypto liquidations, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-influences-price-investors-sentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin remains substantially higher</a> for the year, boasting an approximate 60% increase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price is likely in the middle of a bull run, and it could continue the rally following the halving event.</strong></p>



<p>This is further substantiated by the investors holding on to their BTC, which is a testament to their conviction, stronger than in 2021.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-investors-show-confidence">Bitcoin Investors Show Confidence</h2>



<p>After posting a new all-time high this month,<a href="https://beincrypto.com/hong-kong-approve-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> halted the rally as the market cooled down. While many considered this to indicate a market top, this may be its mid-point. The reason behind this is the conviction shown by investors.</p>



<p>This is evident from the Relative Realized Profits. Comparing the present bull cycle&#8217;s profit-taking to the 2021 cycle&#8217;s, it becomes evident that investors are much more anchored this time around. In 2021, around the all-time high of $64,500, the realized profits were at 3%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="489" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08-850x489.png" alt="Bitcoin Relative Realized Profits. " class="wp-image-500301" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08-850x489.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08-360x207.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08-768x442.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08-1536x884.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08-150x86.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/woc-15-08.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Relative Realized Profits. Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, at the moment, the same metric is peaking at 1.8%. This suggests that 1.8% of the market cap was locked in as profit over a seven-day period. Investors have not been selling their holdings as much as they did back in 2021, showing conviction.</p>

<p>This is supported by the consistent accumulation noted since February. Investors have been majorly adding to their wallets, and in the last 11 days of April alone, over 10,284 <a href="https://beincrypto.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-options-expire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC worth over $728 million</a> have been bought from exchanges.</p>

Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Accumulation indicates confidence among investors as it shows that they are expecting further price growth. This sentiment will likely be validated as the bullish halving event takes place.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/btc-price-downturn-key-indicators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s price over a 3-day timeframe</a> validates a Wyckoff pattern.

<p>However, if <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-demand-push-price-not-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s price falls below this support level</a>, a decline could be observed to $63,159.

<p><strong>BNB Coin’s price is close to breaking and making records following a struggle to find the right moment.</strong></p>



<p>After failing multiple breaches, BNB is ready to break out if the investors can help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bnb-investors-exhibit-bullishness">BNB Investors Exhibit Bullishness</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/will-binance-find-headquarters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB Coin’s price is trading at $621</a> within an ascending triangle pattern, and to break out of it, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/binance-labs-offloading-altcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance native token</a> will have to find support first. Fortunately for the cryptocurrency, investors are seemingly in a mood to accumulate.</p>



<p>This is verified by the uptick in the Chaikin Oscillator, which indicates whether the asset in focus is observing buying or selling pressure. A rise above zero suggests that buying pressure is increasing, which is also the case with BNB.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp-850x363.png" alt="BNB Coin Chaikin Oscillator." class="wp-image-500201" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp-850x363.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp-360x154.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp-768x328.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp-1536x656.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp-150x64.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5V1u4jZp.png 1805w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BNB Coin Chaikin Oscillator. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Considering this as a hint of potential accumulation, the asset does seem to be in a good state to draw further investment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, BNB Coin is seemingly a good option to invest in, given its Sharpe Ratio is at 2.71 at the moment. The Sharpe ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment by comparing its return to its volatility. A higher value indicates better risk-adjusted performance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="446" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-135254-850x446.png" alt="BNB Sharpe Ratio:" class="wp-image-500202" style="aspect-ratio:1.905829596412556;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-135254-850x446.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-135254-360x189.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-135254-768x403.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-135254-150x79.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-135254.png 1482w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BNB Sharpe Ratio: Source: <a href="https://messari.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Messari</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thus, BNB will likely post good risk-adjusted returns, which will attract new investors to the asset and, in return, boost BNB Coin’s price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bnb-price-predicition-awaiting-a-breakout">BNB Price Predicition: Awaiting a Breakout</h2>



<p><a href="A Comprehensive Guide to What It Is and How It Works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB Coin’s price action is currently constricted</a> within an ascending triangle pattern. A horizontal resistance line and a rising trendline characterize this bullish continuation pattern. It indicates increasing buying pressure and potential for an upward breakout.</p>



<p>Based on the pattern, the target for the Binance native token following a breakout is $764, marking a 21% rally. However, the more realistic outlook is that owing to the aforementioned cues, BNB Coin’s price will certainly cross the present all-time high of $676 to mark new highs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SDOc7mcR-850x363.png" alt="BNB/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>However, if the BNB Coin&#8217;s price fails, the breach of $656 falls through the lower trend line of the pattern, and it could drop to $575. Losing this level would invalidate the bullish outlook, followed by a decline to $550.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain is set for another significant leap with the anticipated Pectra upgrade, following the successful Dencun upgrade that reduced transaction costs. </strong></p>



<p>Slated for release between late 2024 and early 2025, the Pectra upgrade focuses on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074 and EIP 2935. These vital modifications aim to transform how users interact with Ethereum wallets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-community-discusses-pros-and-cons-of-pectra">Ethereum Community Discusses Pros and Cons of Pectra</h2>



<p>During a recent bi-weekly call, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-team-challenges-dencun-testnet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum developers</a> announced that EIP 3074 would be central to the Pectra upgrade. Tim Beiko, a core Ethereum developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1778490341437681684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> its inclusion with a post on April 11. </p>



<p>This upgrade will introduce several <a href="https://beincrypto.com/smart-contract-market-value-5-trillion-2030-ark-invest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart contract</a> functionalities to ordinary <a href="https://beincrypto.com/robinhood-ethereum-holdings-fifth-largest-arkham-invest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum wallets</a>, significantly enhancing the user experience.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Execution Layer Meeting 185 [2024-04-11]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWvi_z1_gB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>According to Domothy, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, EIP 3074 will <a href="https://domothy.com/eip3074/?ref=bankless.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">introduce</a> a novel social recovery tool. This tool requires users to initially transfer asset ownership to an invoker contract via a digital signature. This contract will facilitate future transactions and enable users to reclaim their assets if they lose or forget their <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ledger-details-recover-feature-white-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seed phrase</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, EIP 3074 eliminates the need for users to have Ethereum in their wallets to execute transactions. The entity behind the invoker contract can cover these costs upfront. This feature could significantly expand <a href="https://beincrypto.com/interest-ethereum-staking-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum’s appeal</a> by lowering the barriers to entry for new users.</p>



<p>Moreover, EIP 3074 allows the batching of transactions. Users can approve multiple transactions at once, streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency. On-chain analyst Hitesh Malviya praises this upgrade for its potential impact on Web3 gaming. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a game-changer for web3 gaming, where you can sign your session once and then play the whole game without worrying about interacting with smart contracts,&#8221; Malviya <a href="https://twitter.com/hmalviya9/status/1778460252264087787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Uniswap developer Hayden Adams echoes this enthusiasm, <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1778513861408129181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">describing</a> the inclusion of EIP 3074 as a “monumental upgrade to Ethereum UX.” However, the upgrade has also raised concerns. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Downside of EIP 3074 is that now it&#8217;ll be possible to fully drain an address (all tokens, all NFTs, all defi positions&#8230;) with only one bad signature,&#8221; DefiLlama co-founder 0xngmi <a href="https://twitter.com/0xngmi/status/1778539816180965778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with speculation of an impending &#8216;altseason,&#8217; a period typically marked by substantial gains in alternative cryptocurrencies, or &#8216;altcoins.&#8217; </strong></p>



<p>Traders and analysts have noted several bullish signs on technical charts that suggest smaller-cap cryptocurrencies could soon see significant value increases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-analysts-altseason-s-arrival-seems-unavoidable">Analysts: Altseason&#8217;s Arrival Seems Unavoidable</h2>



<p>Renowned trader and analyst Rekt Capital recently highlighted that despite Bitcoin&#8217;s volatile price action, the altcoin market cap has consistently tested the $315 billion mark as a support level. This steadfast behavior amidst market swings could signify a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-surging-sec-kick-off-altseason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">foundation for the next bull run</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="570" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59-850x570.png" alt="Altcoin market cap excluding top 10" class="wp-image-500193" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59-850x570.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59-360x241.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59-768x515.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59-1536x1029.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59-150x101.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-59.png 1794w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Altcoin market cap excluding top 10.

<p>Crypto enthusiasts often look to altcoins for their higher risk-to-reward ratio, anticipating considerable surges during bull market phases. Traditionally, altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin&#8217;s lead, with their value appreciations lagging behind the premier cryptocurrency&#8217;s price movements. </p>



<p>Market capitalization charts and Bitcoin dominance metrics serve as indicators for analysts <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-venture-capitalists-altcoin-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicting when altcoins might embark on a bull season</a>. Nevertheless, most altcoins have recently corrected following mid-March highs, while Bitcoin remains near its record peak of over $70,000. </p>



<p><strong>Read More: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-meme-coins/">7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that Are Trending in 2024</a></strong></p>



<p>This correction has not deterred analysts from keeping a close watch on the Bitcoin dominance chart, which has been over 50% since September 2023 and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">currently sits at 54.65%</a>, per Tradingview data.</p>



<p>Analyst Crypto Nova suggests that a shift in Bitcoin dominance is typically the precursor to altcoins outshining their predecessor. Although a reversal is not yet apparent, she notes that the lateral movement on the chart often precedes such changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="675" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-850x675.png" alt="https://x.com/CryptoGirlNova/status/1777637932372811979" class="wp-image-500194" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-850x675.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-360x286.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-768x610.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-1536x1220.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-2048x1627.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-60-150x119.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Dominance.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;But overall speaking it&#8217;s increasingly clear and almost good as guaranteed that the shift from Bitcoin outperformance (BTC dom rising) To altcoin outperformance (BTC dom dropping) is happening,&#8221; Crypto Nova Added. </p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bull-run-post-btc-halving">Bull Run Post BTC Halving? </h2>



<p>Adding to the discussion, technical analyst Titan of Crypto has publicly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/technical-charts-altseason-just-ahead-analysts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expressed</a> belief in another upcoming altseason. They assert that the Ichimoku indicator will likely obstruct Bitcoin dominance and herald the arrival of the altseason.</p>



<p>&#8220;I personally believe there will be another altseason. And like in 2021, SSB (Senkou Span B), the strongest line of Ichimoku, will play a big role in blocking Bitcoin dominance, initiating the Altseason2024,&#8221; Titan of Crypto stated.</p>

<p>In a recent communication to his followers, analyst Kevin Svenson posited that the altcoin market cap is primed for a considerable bullish run. He emphasizes the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-influences-price-investors-sentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-Bitcoin halving phase as a historical pivot point</a> towards increased interest in altcoins.</p>



<p>&#8220;People often forget &#8230; AFTER <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hashtag_click">#Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s Halving is when the narrative shifts toward $Alts,&#8221; Svenson said.</p>

<p>The crypto market cap hovers around $2.7t trillion, with most altcoins trading flat. Investor anticipation is palpable as market observers await the shifting tide. The evidence mounting in technical charts signals that altcoins may soon take center stage, heralding a potentially lucrative altseason.</p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin (BTC) has yet again demonstrated its resilience and potential for significant gains. This is according to ARK Invest&#8217;s latest report, &#8220;The Bitcoin Monthly,&#8221; covering the events of March 2024.</strong></p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s price reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 in March, marking an approximately 18.5% gain from the start of the month. The price level also represents a nearly 75% surge during Q1 2024. However, after achieving this ATH, BTC entered a period of consolidation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-market-remains-bullish-despite-profit-taking">Bitcoin Market Remains Bullish Despite Profit-Taking</h2>



<p>ARK Invest&#8217;s analysis highlights that the market sentiment remains robust despite significant profit-taking by <a href="https://beincrypto.com/around-60-of-bitcoin-holders-are-in-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term holders</a>. This trend is underscored by a steadfast group of investors who have held their positions for five years or more. Their commitment underpins stability in the face of profit-taking.</p>



<p>One of the core indicators, MVRV Z-Score, suggests that Bitcoin has not yet entered the excessively exuberant zone often seen in past cycle peaks.</p>

<p>Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score is an indicator that measures the market value against the realized value. While technically overbought according to certain indicators, the MVRV Z-score suggests <a href="https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-bitcoin-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s relative valuation</a> remains below the levels indicative of unsustainable market froth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="366" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-62-850x366.png" alt="Bitcoin's Health based on Several Key Metrics." class="wp-image-500197" style="aspect-ratio:2.3224043715846996;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-62-850x366.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-62-360x155.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-62-768x331.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-62-150x65.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-62.png 1358w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin&#8217;s Health Based on Several Key Metrics.

<p>Regarding technical support levels, Bitcoin&#8217;s price exceeds several key metrics, including the short-term holder cost basis and the 200-day moving average. This suggests a resilient market price; however, significant sell-offs can trigger price corrections.</p>



<p>March also saw a notable balance in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-gbtc-outflow-slow-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflow and outflow of funds in the US spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, with assets under management climbing to over $59 billion. This shows continued interest and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-holdings-price-surge-nayib-bukele/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investment in Bitcoin</a>, reinforcing its appeal to retail and institutional investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;In March, US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows hit records that nearly balanced at $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively,&#8221; ARK Invest <a href="https://ark-invest.com/crypto-reports/the-bitcoin-monthly-march-2024-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Further buoying the positive outlook is the improvement in Bitcoin&#8217;s risk-adjusted returns. ARK notes that Bitcoin&#8217;s four-year annualized returns and the Sharpe ratio have reached three-year highs. This momentum upswing follows a period of lower volatility and less dramatic price action throughout 2022 and 2023.</p>



<p>On the innovation front, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-target-technological-innovations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s scaling solutions</a> are seeing rapid advancements. More than 50 independent projects are developing on the Bitcoin base layer, employing technologies such as Roll-ups, State Channels, and Sidechains.</p>



<p>Significant contributions from initiatives like the Lightning Network, Rootstock, and Stacks have collectively locked in nearly $700 million in value since October 2023.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to remember that the outlook presented by ARK Invest here only summarizes Bitcoin&#8217;s performance in March 2024. </p>

<p>While it may guide how BTC will perform in the coming months, other factors are equally important to consider. These factors include <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-drives-miner-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming Bitcoin halving event</a> and macroeconomic factors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.exabits.ai/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=beincrypto&amp;utm_campaign=apr2024&amp;utm_content=myshell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exabits</a> has demonstrated its capability to train large language models (LLMs), partnering with MyShell to dramatically reduce training costs from billions to under $100,000.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://research.myshell.ai/jetmoe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JetMoE-8B</a> is trained at <strong>less than a $0.1 million cost but outperforms LLaMA2-7B from Meta AI (multi-billion dollar compute cost)</strong></p>



<p>MyShell: <em>“Achieving LlaMA2 performance with the $100,000 JetMoE model, inspired by the sparse activation architecture of ModuleFormer, signifies a remarkable milestone in machine learning. The </em><a href="https://research.myshell.ai/jetmoe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>JetMoE-8B</em></a><em>, with its 8 billion parameters and sophisticated structure of 24 blocks, each housing two MoE layers (Attention Head Mixture and MLP Experts Mixture), showcases advanced efficiency and computational intelligence. </em></p>



<p><em>Each layer’s selective activation of 2 out of 8 experts per input token demonstrates a refined utilization of the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) framework, enhancing the model&#8217;s responsiveness and resource management.”</em></p>



<p>The efficiency of JetMoE-8B, with its 2.2 billion activation parameters, significantly lowered training costs while delivering robust performance. The model&#8217;s effectiveness is illustrated in the subsequent figure: JetMoE-8B achieved state-of-the-art results in five categories on eight evaluation benchmarks, outperforming competitors like LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B, and DeepseekMoE-16B.</p>



<p>On the MT-Bench benchmark, JetMoE-8B scored 6.681, surpassing models with larger capacities, such as LLaMA2 and Vicuna, which possess 13 billion parameters.</p>



<p>But what superpowers this architectural sophistication is Exabits&#8217; contribution of an accelerated and stabilized cluster of 12 H100 GPU nodes (96 GPUs). Exabits’ platform played a pivotal role in powering the JetMoE model, ensuring stable, ultra-available and robust performance at a fraction of the cost of “big compute.” </p>



<p>This synergy between JetMoE&#8217;s innovative design and Exabits’ cutting-edge GPU technology not only exemplifies a leap in machine learning capabilities but also highlights the effectiveness of combining advanced model architectures with Exabits’ cloud compute infrastructure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breaking-the-myth-decentralized-gpu-platform-for-llm-training"><strong>Breaking the Myth: Decentralized GPU Platform for LLM Training</strong></h2>



<p>Exabits has disproved the skepticism that decentralized GPU platforms are unsuitable for LLM training. With a sophisticated technical stack, efficient middleware, and a robust supply chain of computational resources, Exabits has demonstrated that LLM training and inference are not only possible but also efficient and deeply cost-effective on such a platform.</p>



<p>Exabits, a decentralized cloud compute platform, overcomes the limitations of standard decentralized platforms by serving as the infrastructure base layer of AI computing and offering a full-stack solution. It does this by aggregating, accelerating, and stabilizing consumer-grade GPUs to match enterprise-grade GPU performance to almost parity. This approach taps into a vast, yet largely idle reserve of consumer GPUs, easing the GPU shortage crisis. </p>



<p>Also, Exabits&#8217; extensive experience in the data center sector provides unique access to coveted enterprise-grade H100 and A100 GPUs, and soon the B200s, further advancing the democratization of AI development. Partnerships with projects like io.net, Render Network, Akash, Aethir, EMC, and Solana have helped Exabits to seed and establish a widespread, interconnected decentralized compute network. </p>



<p>This super-network has the potential to stand against the likes of AWS, Google, and Microsoft, making AI accessible to anyone who wants to build in the space. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-llm-training-with-exabits"><strong>The Future of LLM Training with Exabits</strong></h2>



<p>Exabits is not just a technological platform; it is embodying affordability, accessibility, and environmental consciousness. The success of JetMoE-8B underlines the feasibility of this platform in executing high-end model training, paving the way for more sustainable and inclusive advancements in AI research and development.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Exabits may definitely be considered as a visible player in the AI domain, challenging big compute and proving that cloud compute platforms in the web3 space can indeed support real LLM training efficiently and cost-effectively. This not only opens up new avenues for AI research and application but also sets a new standard in the computational economy, heralding a new era of innovation and collaboration in the field of web3 and artificial intelligence.</p>
