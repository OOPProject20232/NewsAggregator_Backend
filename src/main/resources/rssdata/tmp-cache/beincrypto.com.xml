<p><strong>Web3 gaming platform Circle of Games (COG) has secured $1 million in funding from strategic investors. Nazara Technologies and The Hashgraph Association are among those who participate in this investment.</strong></p>



<p>The investment aims to accelerate COG&#8217;s growth and expand its global reach in the Web3 gaming market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-circle-of-games-aims-to-bring-millions-of-gamers-to-web3">Circle of Games Aims to Bring Millions of Gamers to Web3</h2>



<p>The funding aims to support COG&#8217;s efforts to add more games to its platform, improve capabilities, and establish a presence in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.</p>



<p>Currently, COG has over 250,000 registered users. It plans to onboard <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nfts-could-coax-gamers-into-crypto-study-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of gamers</a> from the casual and hyper-casual communities by 2026.</p>



<p>Nazara, India&#8217;s only publicly traded gaming company, brings substantial industry experience in eSports, sports media, and technology. The company&#8217;s recent commitment to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/a16z-web3-gaming-speedrun-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investing in Web3 companies</a> aligns perfectly with COG&#8217;s focus on blockchain-powered gaming experiences.</p>

<p>The connection between Hedera, backed by The Hashgraph Association, and COG&#8217;s use of Hedera for its transactions also makes the investment noteworthy.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to further empower the global Web3 gaming industry through our co-investment with Nazara Technologies in Circle of Games,&#8221; Youssefi <a href="https://chainwire.org/2024/04/18/circle-of-games-secures-1-million-of-strategic-funding-from-nazara-technologies-and-the-hashgraph-association/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond the investment, COG plans to leverage its existing collaborations with Chingari, Solana, Foundership, KGeN/IndiGG, Metarun, TheFishVerse, Ninja Games, and various gaming communities to reach a massive audience of over 500 million gamers across the globe.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>COG offers casual and skill-based games integrated with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/data-popular-play-earn-crypto-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play-to-earn mechanics</a> and true asset ownership.

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/astroport-migrates-to-neutron/">Cosmos Market Maker Astroport Migrates to New Chain: New ASTRO Tokens Issued</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Cosmos-based automated market maker (AMM) Astroport has successfully migrated its governance and staking operations to the Neutron (NTRN) blockchain.</strong></p>



<p>This move marks a significant step for Astroport, offering new features and potentially enhanced opportunities within the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-astro-and-xastro-tokens-are-now-live-on-neutron">ASTRO and xASTRO Tokens Are Now Live on Neutron</h2>



<p>The platform has issued new Neutron-based versions of its governance token, ASTRO, and its staked counterpart, xASTRO. Holders of the previous ASTRO and xASTRO tokens must convert them to the new Neutron-based versions to continue participating in governance and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xai-staking-pools-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staking rewards</a>.</p>



<p>Astroport&#8217;s migration aims to introduce new features. Users will soon be able to lock xASTRO to receive vxASTRO. This feature will give voting powers to direct ASTRO emissions and to earn protocol fees called &#8216;tributes&#8217; through Curve&#8217;s veCRV-inspired system.</p>

<p>For the DeFi community, this migration is noteworthy as Astroport plays <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-projects-cosmos-atom-thriving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crucial role within Cosmos</a>. It&#8217;s the second-largest AMM <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trader-list-cosmos-atom-ecosystem-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the Cosmos ecosystem</a>, boasting over $120 million in liquidity.</p>



<p>The move to Neutron <a href="https://forum.astroport.fi/t/arc-57-astroport-neutron/1063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">began</a> in May 2023, with the initial proposal to establish Astroport&#8217;s hub on the blockchain.&nbsp;The proposal was further solidified through joint proposals on both Astroport&#8217;s and Neutron&#8217;s governance forums in September 2023.</p>



<p>To foster <a href="https://beincrypto.com/neutron-avril-dutheil-strategy-cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alignment between the two communities</a>, the migration included donating 5% of the ASTRO supply to the Neutron DAO and a reciprocal donation of NTRN from the Neutron DAO to the Astroport Protocol Foundation.</p>



<p>Users can now swap tokens and provide liquidity on the Neutron chain through Astroport. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-offer-highest-staking-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stakers will also reap the rewards</a> using the Neutron chain.</p>



<p>The Neutron team expressed their excitement over the migration.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Astroport&#8217;s successful migration to Neutron marks an important milestone in our shared journey toward fostering a robust, permissionless, and decentralized financial ecosystem,&#8221; they <a href="https://blog.neutron.org/the-next-chapter-astroports-migration-to-neutron-7a5e2dbd4b37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite recent news, the ASTRO token has recorded a modest performance, experiencing a decrease of 0.53%. It is now trading at $0.12.</p>

<p><strong>Japan&#8217;s SBI Group has announced plans to issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the XRP Ledger for the upcoming World Expo 2025 in Osaka. SBI Group is a financial service conglomerate based in Japan.</strong></p>



<p>This initiative aims to integrate blockchain technology to enhance visitor interactions seamlessly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-nfts-target-28-million-visitors">XRP NFTs Target 28 Million Visitors</h2>



<p>Using <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-ledger-adoption-sec-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple&#8217;s XRP Ledger,</a> SBI will create and distribute visitor NFTs featuring MYAKU-MYAKU, the official character of the Expo. Attendees can obtain these digital collectibles by participating in Expo activities and utilizing the Expo mobile app. </p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s VP of Corporate Strategy and Operations, Emi Yoshikawa, took to X social media to <a href="https://twitter.com/emy_wng/status/1781013776281620747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">describe</a> this initiative as a &#8220;huge&#8221; development for Ripple and the blockchain community.</p>



<p>Scheduled from April to October on an artificial island in Osaka Bay, the World Expo 2025 expects to draw an estimated 28 million visitors globally. Historically, World Expos illuminate scientific, economic, and technological advancements. </p>



<p>Reflecting this tradition, the Expo will specifically focus on connection, empowerment, and life preservation themes.</p>

<p>Japan has a storied past hosting World Expos, including events in the 70s and 90s. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/japanese-prime-minister-nft-rewards-support-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incorporating NFTs</a> in this upcoming Expo is indeed innovative and strategically enhances visitor engagement, making the event more interactive and memorable. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>Furthermore, there has been a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nfts-on-chain-activity-ripple-xrp-xrpl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge in network activity on Ripple’s XRP Ledger</a>, driven largely by NFT transactions.

<p>This growing adoption highlights Ripple Ledger&#8217;s capacity for handling substantial transaction volumes. However, there has been a decline in sales, particularly since the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a momentary decline below $60,000 on Friday morning Asia market time after news that Israel had launched retaliatory missile strikes against Iran. ABC News cited a senior US official who confirmed the strikes.</strong></p>



<p>This latest escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict temporarily rattled the crypto market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-geopolitical-tensions-impact-the-crypto-market">Geopolitical Tensions Impact the Crypto Market</h2>



<p>Israel&#8217;s missile strikes come as a response to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/iran-israel-bitcoin-crypto-market-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Iranian attack last Saturday</a>, where Iran reportedly launched over 300 drones and missiles toward targets in Israel. Israeli officials <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-gaza-hamas-war/congressional-party-leaders-reach-consensus-on-aid-to-israel-and-ukraine-schumer-says-109222982?id=108860743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">state</a> that all but a handful of these were successfully intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States.</p>



<p>The recent developments in the Israel-Iran conflict caused a momentary dip in the value of Bitcoin (BTC), dropping to $60,000. However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin has rebounded and is now valued at $62,500.</p>



<p>Along with Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, experienced a momentary drop in value, reaching as low as $2,876. Yet, similar to Bitcoin, ETH has also rebounded and is currently trading at $3,000.</p>



<p>Additionally, according to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a> from Coinglass, the total crypto liquidation amount within the last hour is a modest $49.35 million, primarily stemming from long positions. However, in the past 24 hours, more than $250 million has been liquidated.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these events are notably unfolding as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-influences-price-investors-sentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s halving is nearing</a>. Based on NiceHash <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-halving-2024-05-10-12-00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a>, the current block height is 839,871, with roughly 129 blocks remaining until the halving event. Despite the momentary market fluctuation, experts remain <a href="https://beincrypto.com/is-bitcoin-crypto-bull-market-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullish about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term price trajectory</a>, particularly post-halving.</p>



<p>A recent report from Glassnode and Coinbase Institutional explains one of the fundamental reasons.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The ethos of Bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency is under threat, according to Kadan Stadelmann, the CTO of Komodo, who has voiced concerns to BeInCrypto over the increasing centralization within the network. </strong></p>



<p>This shift from its foundational principles could redefine Bitcoin&#8217;s role in the financial landscape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-huge-mining-powerhouse">One Huge Mining Powerhouse</h2>



<p>Since its inception by <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> in 2009, Bitcoin has been celebrated as a pioneering force for financial autonomy and freedom, free from the control of centralized financial institutions. However, recent developments suggest a departure from this ideal, steering Bitcoin towards what Stadelmann terms a &#8220;centralized paradox.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of the most significant indicators of this trend is the concentration of mining power within a handful of mining pools. Foundry USA and Antpool, for example, now <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">control</a> over 50% of Bitcoin&#8217;s total hashrate. This concentration is even more pronounced when considering that more than 80% of mining power is held by just five pools. </p>



<p>Such dominance by a few undermines the decentralized nature that Bitcoin was supposed to exemplify.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="738" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-7.30.42-PM-850x738.png" alt="Distribution of Bitcoin's Network Hashrate" class="wp-image-502543" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-7.30.42-PM-850x738.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-7.30.42-PM-360x313.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-7.30.42-PM-768x667.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-7.30.42-PM-150x130.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-7.30.42-PM.png 1414w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Distribution of Bitcoin&#8217;s Network Hashrate. Source: <a href="https://statista.com">Statista</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The influence of government and regulatory bodies also complicates the picture. For instance, North America’s Blockseer pool not only meets but exceeds the US Government’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance standards. </p>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-regulation/">Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?</a></strong></p>



<p>This compliance introduces a level of government oversight and control that was previously absent, diluting the decentralized promise of Bitcoin.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;In short, a minority of miners control substantial resources, undermining the decentralized ethos that Bitcoin claims to uphold. This scenario questions the egalitarian nature that Bitcoin was purported to represent and opens discussions about the true beneficiaries of this digital currency,&#8221; Stadelmann told BeInCrypto. </p>
</blockquote>







<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-american-institutions-take-over">American Institutions Take Over</h2>



<p>Stadelmann also believes that the growing engagement of major financial institutions in Bitcoin mining operations signals another shift towards centralization. </p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-said-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> has acquired significant shares in two leading Bitcoin mining companies, 6.71% in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/marathon-digital-mine-btc-monthly-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Digital Holdings</a> and 6.61% in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/riot-blockchain-rebrands-amid-miner-capitulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Blockchain</a>, with investments nearing $383 million. Since 2014, Fidelity Group has been actively mining Bitcoin. On the other hand, Vanguard holds roughly 17.9 million shares in Riot Platforms and 17.5 million shares in Marathon Digital.</p>



<p>This is not just about financial investment. In January, BlackRock further integrated Bitcoin into the mainstream financial market by filing documents with the SEC to include a spot <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a>. This new financial instrument now manages 272,800 BTC, valued at $17.20 billion. </p>



<p>This figure does not even include holdings from similar products managed by other entities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The increasing influence of these financial giants in Bitcoin mining operations could lead to a scenario where the decision-making and control over the network become concentrated in the hands of a few, rather than being distributed among a diverse group of participants,&#8221; Stadelmann added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core of the problem lies in the stark contrast between Bitcoin’s current trajectory and its original purpose. Bitcoin&#8217;s original vision was to operate as a decentralized network, independent of traditional financial systems. However, increasing centralization might draw it closer to the very systems it aimed to circumvent.</p>

<p>This centralization is not just a technical issue but a fundamental question about the nature and future of Bitcoin. It challenges the decentralized ethos that has been a significant draw for investors and users attracted to the idea of a financial system free from traditional constraints. </p>



<p>Therefore, the call from Stadelmann for a robust discussion within the Bitcoin community is timely and essential. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the days leading up to the Bitcoin halving, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant downturn, raising concerns about a potential bear market. </strong></p>



<p>Bitcoin saw a notable 19% price drop, while altcoins faced even steeper declines, with some plummeting by as much as 70%. This trend has sparked a debate among investors about the immediate future of cryptocurrencies as the halving approaches.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-and-altcoins-nosedive-before-the-halving">Bitcoin and Altcoins Nosedive Before the Halving</h2>



<p>Historically, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin halving</a> — a scheduled reduction in the reward for mining new blocks — has been a catalyst for bullish market sentiment. The event effectively slashes the supply of new BTC, which in theory should increase the price if demand remains constant. </p>



<p>However, Garry Kabankin, Market Analyst at Santiment, told BeInCrypto that the market does not operate solely on fundamentals, particularly in periods surrounding such significant events. The recent <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-drops-liquidations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price corrections in Bitcoin and altcoins</a> may reflect a natural market response to speculative anticipation, rather than fundamental declines in value.</p>



<p>Indeed, the current market scenario reflects a speculative trading environment leading up to the halving. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The steep drop in altcoins, even more so than Bitcoin, underscores the heightened volatility and speculative trading that can precede such events. It&#8217;s a reminder of the market&#8217;s sensitivity to supply dynamics changes, where the reduced block reward post-halving can lead to expectations of decreased supply pressure,&#8221; Kabankin explained. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kabankin explains that observing miner behavior, such as changes in miners&#8217; balance and total supply, can provide further insights. A decrease in miners selling their holdings pre-halving could suggest a bullish outlook, expecting higher prices post-event. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, the true impact of the halving will only become clear in the weeks following. As the market adjusts to the new supply rate, its implications for Bitcoin&#8217;s scarcity and value can be understood.</p>

<p>The ongoing downturn is somewhat typical of the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-investment-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyclical nature observed around past halvings</a>. Essentially, anticipation leads to speculative runs followed by corrections. However, Kabankin points out that given the current on-chain metrics and social sentiment, a nuanced view is necessary. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Historically, we&#8217;ve seen euphoria around halvings, often leading to a reevaluation of positions post-event. It&#8217;s crucial to monitor social sentiment and whale behavior for more immediate signs of market directio,&#8221; Kabankin added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moreover, the Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) ratio offers a clear view of market sentiment. It indicates whether the asset is over or undervalued at any given time. According to Kabankin, investors should also closely monitor the mean coin age.  Significant drops can signal increased movement and potential selling pressure, hinting at broader market shifts.</p>



<p>These indicators, combined with traditional support levels from technical analysis, can guide investors through uncertain times.</p>

Source: <a href="https://santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kabankin believes that to spot the potential resumption of a bull run, investors should pay attention to a blend of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-fear-and-greed-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social sentiment</a> and on-chain metrics. A decrease in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-fud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)</a> coupled with an increase in fear of missing out (FOMO), often precedes market upswings. </p>



<p>Furthermore, a significant uptick in stablecoin supply moving onto exchanges can signal readiness for buying action, hinting at bullish sentiment. Also, an increase in trading volume can indicate growing support for the trend. It may suggest a healthier buildup to a bull run.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Looking at resistance barriers and on-chain signals is crucial for spotting potential turnarounds. One key metric to watch is the Mean Dollar Invested Age, especially when it starts decreasing, which can indicate that previously dormant tokens are moving, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment,&#8221; Kabankin emphasized.</p>

<p>As the crypto market remains notoriously volatile, these signs are vital for predicting its next moves. The historical pattern post-<a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin halving</a> has often ignited altcoin seasons. This is a direct result of investors searching for higher returns beyond the initial surge in Bitcoin.

<p><strong>The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a profound resurgence, as evidenced by Bybit&#8217;s 2024 Institutional Industry Report, developed in partnership with Treehouse. </strong></p>



<p>This analysis highlights the escalating global crypto adoption and its dynamics with traditional finance (TradFi). Over the six-month period ending in March 2024, the crypto market cap surged from just over $1 trillion to a remarkable $2.5 trillion, driven by renewed institutional interest and substantial capital inflows.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-investor-sentiment-high-for-btc-and-eth-as-derivatives-show-bullish-trends">Investor Sentiment High for BTC and ETH as Derivatives Show Bullish Trends</h2>



<p>The report delineates <a href="https://learn.bybit.com/crypto-insights/bybit-institutional-x-treehouse-crypto-landscape-in-q1-2024-analysis-narratives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a notable bullish trend</a> in the derivatives market and active investment movements in on-chain metrics for BTC and ETH. As these primary cryptocurrencies show increasing call premiums despite market fluctuations, investor sentiment remains robust, particularly with the impending bitcoin halving and prospective bull run in 2024.</p>



<p>Furthermore, BTC is gaining traction as a strategic hedge against TradFi, exhibiting minimal correlation with major equity indices. Incorporating a modest allocation of 5% each into BTC and ETH can enhance the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/btc-sp-500-correlation-turns-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sharpe ratio of an S&amp;P 500 portfolio</a> by 43.6%, underscoring the potential of cryptocurrencies as diversification tools within investment portfolios.</p>

<p>Venture capital (VC) investment in the sector is also experiencing a significant uptick. By early 2024, disclosed funding in crypto-related ventures reached $1.94 billion across 243 deals. Correlating to a 36% increase from the previous quarter. This revival of VC interest is particularly concentrated on infrastructure projects crucial to the blockchain ecosystem&#8217;s foundational development. </p>

<p>These projects include advancements in hardware wallets and blockchain data services, vital for addressing industry challenges and fostering innovation.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-dexs-volume-resurgen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Challenger chains like Solana (SOL)</a> are also drawing attention, with their tokens outperforming established players like ETH. Which is reminiscent of their rise in 2021. This shift indicates a broadening interest and confidence in alternative blockchain technologies that promise enhanced transaction capabilities and decentralized applications. This comes especially in the gaming and AI sectors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Tether, a prominent stablecoin issuer, announced an expansion on April 18, 2024, introducing four new business divisions — Data, Finance, Power, and Education.</strong></p>



<p>This move indicates Tether&#8217;s intent to broaden its influence and diversify beyond its core stablecoin operations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tether-s-new-focus-on-tech-and-education">Tether&#8217;s New Focus on Tech and Education</h2>



<p>With its new framework, Tether is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tether Data division will concentrate on strategic investments in emerging fields <a href="https://beincrypto.com/tether-new-focus-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. Its partnerships with companies like Holepunch and investments in&nbsp;Northern Data Group highlight this focus on innovation.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, Tether Finance will remain the hub for Tether&#8217;s existing stablecoin products and financial services. The division aims to utilize blockchain technology to make global financial systems more inclusive. Moreover, its upcoming digital asset tokenization platform could play a role in wider digital asset adoption.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tether Power marks <a href="https://beincrypto.com/tether-invest-500-million-bitcoin-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company&#8217;s entry into Bitcoin mining</a>, emphasizing environmentally sustainable practices. This division aligns with Tether&#8217;s stated priority to support the Bitcoin network responsibly.</p>



<p>Lastly, Tether is diving deep into educational initiatives through its Tether Edu division. Tether Edu supports global access to digital skills, focusing on blockchain and P2P technologies. Its key initiatives include public-private partnerships and investments like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/swiss-lugano-crypto-bitcoin-tether-tax-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lugano&#8217;s Plan B</a> and the Academy of Digital Industries.</p>



<p>Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, emphasized the company&#8217;s innovative ethos in a recent statement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;With this evolution beyond our traditional stablecoin offerings, we are ready to build and support the invention and implementation of cutting-edge technology that removes the limitations of what’s possible in this world,&#8221; Ardoino <a href="https://tether.io/news/tether-advances-beyond-stablecoins-introduces-new-framework-embracing-core-divisions-to-foster-resilient-future-ready-financial-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This announcement comes when the regulatory environment for stablecoins is becoming more intricate.</p>



<p>US senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand have recently proposed new legislation regulating stablecoins. The proposed bill, set for discussion in Congress next month, seeks to enhance consumer protection and preserve the integrity of the US dollar in digital finance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;It protects consumers by mandating one-to-one reserves, prohibiting algorithmic stablecoins, and requiring stablecoin issuers to comply with US anti-money laundering and sanctions rules,&#8221; Senator Gillibrand <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/senators-tout-new-stablecoin-bill-as-broader-banking-deal-eyed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remarked</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although Tether&#8217;s stablecoin is not algorithmic, there are some allegations and concerns that USDT is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/un-report-tether-asia-crypto-crime-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being used for illicit activities</a>, such as terrorism financing. USDT, being the biggest fish in the pond, frequently invites regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>In the latest development, the US Treasury has raised concerns about <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-russia-tether-usdt-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russia&#8217;s alleged use of Tether&#8217;s USDT</a> to circumvent international sanctions and support its military operations.</p>



<p>Undersecretary Wally Adeyemo expressed this concern in a statement to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He further highlights the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-crypto-tool-terrorist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need for additional tools</a> to protect national security.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, Tether&#8217;s expansions beyond stablecoins could pave the way for fostering a more inclusive future of digital assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a strong corrective phase, with the potential for further decline of up to 10%. </strong></p>



<p>Although significant, it remains relatively mild by crypto standards. However, a more significant downturn would occur if the market descends to the golden ratio support level of around $1.45 trillion, essentially halving its value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-down-23-and-falling-what-s-next">Market Down 23% and Falling – What&#8217;s Next?</h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has corrected approximately 23% thus far, breaching key support levels such as the 50-day EMA and the .382 Fib support at around $2.237 trillion. This development suggests the possibility of a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/is-bitcoin-crypto-bull-market-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further correction towards the next Fibonacci support zone</a>, ranging between approximately $1.9 trillion and $1.96 trillion. </p>



<p>A bullish rebound could occur upon reaching this support level, signaling a resumption of the upward trend. Alternatively, if the market continues to decline, the next significant support is expected around the 200-day EMA at approximately $1.856 trillion. </p>



<p>Regarding indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram in the daily chart displays a bearish trend with downward ticks, accompanied by the bearish crossing of the MACD lines. However, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Relative Strength Index</a> (RSI) is in neutral territory, providing no clear bullish or bearish signals.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s32698.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TOTAL_2024-04-18_14-27-28_c4609-850x415.png" alt="Crypto market cap analysis BeInCrypto" class="wp-image-167784"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crypto Market Cap chart. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TOTAL/?exchange=CRYPTOCAP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tradingview</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On a positive note, the EMAs still maintain a golden crossover, indicating a bullish trend in the short to medium term.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4h-chart-update-emas-signal-a-death-cross-formation">4H Chart Update: EMAs Signal a Death Cross Formation</h2>



<p>In the 4-hour chart, the exponential moving averages (EMAs) form a death cross, signaling a short-term bearish trend. Additionally, the MACD lines may soon cross bearishly, as indicated by the downward ticks in the MACD histogram. </p>



<p>Despite this, the RSI remains neutral, offering <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-crypto-market-recover-iran-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no clear bullish or bearish signals</a>. However, there is a possibility of a bullish divergence emerging in the RSI soon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s32698.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TOTAL_2024-04-18_14-27-50_c9898-850x415.png" alt="Crypto market cap analysis BeInCrypto" class="wp-image-167785"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crypto Market Cap chart. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TOTAL/?exchange=CRYPTOCAP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tradingview</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Given these indicators, it appears likely that the correction in the cryptocurrency market will persist. Consequently, the market may revisit the 0.382 Fibonacci support level at approximately $1.96 trillion soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-market-forecast-is-another-11-6-decline-on-the-horizon">Crypto Market Forecast: Is Another 11.6% Decline on the Horizon?</h2>



<p>A descent to the subsequent Fibonacci support level suggests a downside potential of approximately 11.6%, indicating a possible decline of more than 10% once again for the crypto market. This scenario could prompt altcoins to undergo a more pronounced correction. </p>



<p>Moreover, the MACD lines are on the verge of forming a bearish crossover, while the MACD histogram has displayed bearish trends for three weeks. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s32698.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TOTAL_2024-04-18_14-28-15_efa4c-850x415.png" alt="Crypto market cap analysis BeInCrypto" class="wp-image-167786"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crypto Market Cap chart. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TOTAL/?exchange=CRYPTOCAP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tradingview</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, the RSI is transitioning back into the neutral zone after previously being in overbought territories.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-potential-supports-for-crypto-in-case-of-a-massive-correction">Exploring Potential Supports for Crypto in Case of a Massive Correction</h2>



<p>If the crypto market experiences a significant downturn and breaks below the Fibonacci support range between approximately $1.9 trillion and $1.96 trillion in a bearish manner, the next significant Fibonacci support level would only be around $1.45 trillion.</p>







<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s32698.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TOTAL_2024-04-18_14-28-42_e311f-850x415.png" alt="Crypto market cap analysis BeInCrypto" class="wp-image-167787"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crypto Market Cap chart.

<p>Maintaining the market above this level is crucial to sustain the bullish momentum. Alternatively, if this support is breached, significant support can be expected at the 50-month EMA, located at approximately $1.23 trillion.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has currently reached the 0.382 Fibonacci support level at approximately $60,300.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Dogecoin (DOGE), despite noting almost 32%, is still due for further correction due to the lack of bullish cues.</strong></p>



<p>Not only is the broader market opposing recovery, but even investors’ participation is signaling a downswing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-holders-pull-back">Dogecoin Holders Pull Back</h2>



<p>Dogecoin’s price notes the negative impact of the investors’ fading confidence, reflected in their network participation. Evinced by the daily active addresses, the average number of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/x-twitter-ai-grok-dogecoin-doge-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE holders conducting transactions</a> on the network has come down to 57,000.</p>



<p>This is also the lowest figure observed in the last six months, as towards the end of October 2023, only 41,900 active addresses were recorded in a single day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-850x288.png" alt="Dogecoin Active Addresses. " class="wp-image-502517" style="aspect-ratio:2.951388888888889;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.28.32-18-Apr-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dogecoin Active Addresses. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thus, the possibility of a decline is further amplified by the lack of confidence <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-lists-3-altcoins-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observed among DOGE holders</a>.</p>

<p>The same can be seen in the decline noted in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This indicator assesses the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in a security or asset. It oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 indicating overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold conditions.</p>

<p>Presently, RSI is below the neutral line at 50.0 under the downtrend line, entering the bearish neutral zone. This is the farthest this indicator has fallen since the beginning of the year, indicating the bearishness is strong and could extend the corrections.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-price-prediction-looking-at-another-decline">DOGE Price Prediction: Looking at Another Decline</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/doge-strong-holders-profit-selling-slows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin’s price trading at $0.146 is presently</a> under the $0.151 line, acting as a resistance level. Before the recent corrections, DOGE was stuck in a rising wedge, and a breakdown from it would have sent the meme coin toward the target of $0.127.</p>



<p>However, the breakdown arrived earlier than expected, and the correction was also less than predicted by the pattern. This leaves Dogecoin’s price vulnerable to further decline, i.e., another 13% drawdown to reach $0.127.</p>

<p>But if the resistance of $0.151 is flipped into a support floor, the meme coin would have a shot at invalidating the bearish outcome. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/doge-price-vulnerable-corrections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE will likely bounce back</a> to breach $0.160 to continue recovery.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Runes protocol introduces the ability for diverse tokens to operate on the Bitcoin blockchain, significantly altering its traditional focus and increasing transaction fees.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>As Bitcoin nears its next halving, attention is shifting towards an exciting development – the launch of the Runes protocol by developer Casey Rodarmor. Runes will go live after Bitcoin completes halving.</strong></p>



<p>This new framework enables the creation of altcoins directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature was once exclusive to networks like Ethereum and Solana.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-runes-anticipation-spike-up-bitcoin-transaction-fees">Runes Anticipation Spike Up Bitcoin Transaction Fees</h2>



<p>The buzz around <a href="https://beincrypto.com/rune-protocol-bitcoin-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Runes stems from the success of Rodarmor&#8217;s previous project,</a> the Ordinals protocol. Ordinals introduced NFT-like &#8220;inscriptions&#8221; to Bitcoin, infusing innovation and increased mining revenue into the community. </p>



<p>However, this led to network congestion and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-transaction-fees-soar-ordinals-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher transaction fees</a>.</p>



<p>As the launch approaches, its effects are already noticeable, with transaction fees on the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/protocols-expanding-bitcoin-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin network</a> increasing dramatically. Fees have surged by over 45% in just one day and a staggering 892.7% compared to last year. This rise highlights the growing excitement and activity around the new protocol.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="292" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM-850x292.png" alt="Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee" class="wp-image-502460" style="aspect-ratio:2.910958904109589;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM-850x292.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM-360x124.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM-768x264.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM-1536x527.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM-150x51.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-4.54.34-PM.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee.

<p>Runes expands on these capabilities by using <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-on-chain-analysis-utxos-at-loss-surpasses-2019-bear-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs)</a> to support a broad token system. Essentially, a single Rune can represent varying amounts of multiple tokens, enhancing Bitcoin&#8217;s functionality. </p>



<p>Bitcoin entrepreneur Dan Held <a href="https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-runes-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">describes</a> this method as a &#8220;simple strict improvement over BRC-20.&#8221; </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Runes operations do not create a leftover useless UTXO. I’ve learned the hard way that the market doesn’t particularly care about technical improvements so I’m glad that the market is hyped about Runes even if it’s for speculative reasons and hopefully it results in a general improvement on the network,&#8221; Held wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, Runes also marks a major cultural shift within Bitcoin. Traditionally, Bitcoin has focused on its native cryptocurrency. Runes disrupt this by enabling the proliferation of various <a href="https://beincrypto.com/pups-bitcoin-ordinals-sales-skyrocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculative altcoins on Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<p>Yet, the short-term success of Runes and its tokens is under scrutiny. Some analysts predict initial enthusiasm similar to the NFT boom, but concerns about sustained interest and value remain. </p>



<p>DeFi researcher Ignas warns that real investment opportunities may only appear after the initial hype cools down. Ignas explains that the influx of Rune tokens could initially dilute trader attention and investment per token, potentially causing their novelty and value to diminish quickly. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Utility-wise, Runes will trade as meme coins like BRC20s. At least at first, so the excitement of “new” will fade away. Especially if no Rune token manages to sustain the pump and degens lose money,&#8221; Ignas <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiIgnas/status/1780547846141567200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Litecoin&#8217;s (LTC) price looks at recovery following a bearish couple of days, which also validated a 30% decline.</strong></p>



<p>However, how far the potential recovery will take LTC is the question as investors&#8217; participation grows.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-litecoin-bullish-signals-arise">Litecoin Bullish Signals Arise</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/cftc-ethereum-litecoin-commodities-kucoin-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin&#8217;s price is looking at potential recovery</a>, considering the altcoin has been reeling from the recent decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal positive outcomes.</p>



<p>RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, while MACD indicates trend direction and momentum strength through moving averages&#8217; convergence or divergence.</p>



<p>The former is on the verge of breaching past the neutral line at 50.0 to register a bullish development. MACD is also exhibiting rising bullishness at the moment, which could propel LTC towards recovery.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="380" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl-850x380.png" alt="Litecoin RSI and MACD. " class="wp-image-502507" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl-850x380.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl-360x161.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl-768x344.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl-1536x688.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl-150x67.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/T1p9gAEl.png 1805w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Litecoin RSI and MACD. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Investors are also seemingly very optimistic about a recovery. Over the last 72 hours, the total volume of transactions on the chain has noted a surge for the first time in almost a year.</p>



<p><strong>Read More: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-litecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Buy Litecoin (LTC) and Everything You Need To Know</a></strong></p>



<p>Transactions amounting to $9.27 billion were recorded daily, a 168% rise from the average volume. This shows that interest is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-lists-3-altcoins-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rising among LTC holders</a>, which could support the expected recovery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ltc-price-prediction-crossing-86-next">LTC Price Prediction: Crossing $86 Next?</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/litecoin-price-outlook-bull-run-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin&#8217;s price is trading</a> at $81 after bouncing back from the local support of $77 in the last few days. At the time of writing, the altcoin nearly flips the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement of $115 to $57. Marked at $79, this support floor would provide LTC with a boost to breach $86.</p>



<p>The Fib level of 50% coincides with this price, and reclaiming it as support would confirm a recovery rally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="381" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DbTWP2YD-850x381.png" alt="LTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

<p>However, losing the support of $79 and $77 would result in LTC&#8217;s price <a href="https://beincrypto.com/litecoin-price-pullback-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling to test the 23.6% Fib level</a> at $71.
