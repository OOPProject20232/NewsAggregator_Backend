										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>ZachXBT warned that a malicious group notorious for perpetrating blockchain fraud has its tentacles spread across various Ethereum Layer 2 networks, including Base, Blast, and Arbitrum.</strong></p>



<p>According to the crypto sleuth, the group was responsible for sizable thefts from projects like Magnate, Kokomo, Lendora, and Solfire. These scammers usually accumulate assets totaling seven figures before absconding with users&#8217; funds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-malicious-actors-targeting-ethereum-layer-2-networks">Malicious Actors Targeting Ethereum Layer-2 Networks</h2>



<p>In an extensive report, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/zachxbt-crypto-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZachXBT</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1779519372568019347/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">disclosed</a> that the fraudulent syndicate successfully laundered around $1 million in illicit funds. The group is now using these funds to entice unsuspecting individuals to Leaper Finance, a decentralized lending protocol operating on the Blast network.</p>



<p>Expanding their nefarious activities, ZachXBT has uncovered potential links between the group and another lending protocol named Zebra Lending, situated on the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-base-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Base network</a>. The investigator highlighted that the deployer of Zebra Lending is associated with an address connected to funds from Lendora and Magnate Finance protocols. Zebra Lending boasts over $300,000 in assets locked within its protocol.</p>

<p>Additionally, the syndicate&#8217;s connections extend to Glori Finance, a cross-chain lending protocol established on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/optimism-vs-arbitrum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a>. This protocol holds approximately $1.4 million worth of digital assets.</p>



<p>For this reason, ZachXBT recommends that users promptly withdraw their assets from these platforms to mitigate the risks.</p>

<p>Interestingly, ZachXBT noted that each fraudulent project highlighted in the report was a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/compound-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compound V2 fork</a>. Compound is a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/earn-on-steth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized protocol</a> enabling users to lend and borrow crypto, with governance facilitated by its native COMP token. Data from DeFiLlama positions Compound among the top five lending platforms, boasting a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $2.57 billion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple's XRPL proposed native lending protocol would enable direct lending and borrowing of fungible tokens like XRP, wBTC, and wETH.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ripple is leading an initiative to bolster the XRP Ledger&#8217;s (XRPL) decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities with an on-chain lending protocol.</strong></p>



<p>The proposal, labeled 0066 XLS—66d, aims to establish a censorship-resistant DeFi ecosystem within the network. It is currently open for public scrutiny on GitHub.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-lending-protocol-on-xrp-ledger">New Lending Protocol on XRP Ledger</h2>



<p>Ripple unveiled the proposal for a native lending protocol on the XRPL. This protocol is poised to enhance XRPL&#8217;s interaction with the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-defi-protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi ecosystem</a>, marking a significant step towards improved financial inclusivity and transparency.</p>



<p>The proposed protocol introduces a direct lending and borrowing mechanism that prioritizes flexibility and reusability. Notably, the protocol allows participants to contribute fungible tokens such as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a>, wBTC, and wETH to a lending pool to earn interest.</p>



<p>The platform would also allow loan terms to be negotiated off-chain and then securely recorded on-chain. This streamlined process would facilitate user engagement and ensure transparency and security.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The Lending Protocol enables fixed-term loans with pre-set terms for interest-accruing loans. It bypasses the need for collateral by using off-chain underwriting, risk management, and a first-loss capital protection scheme in case of default,&#8221; RippleX <a href="https://twitter.com/RippleXDev/status/1778913021730963581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 6 DeFi Lending Platforms</a></strong></p>



<p>Notably, blockchain developers stand to gain significantly from this proposal, as &#8220;its modular design and extensibility make it easy to build and integrate lending decentralized applications on the XRPL.&#8221; This innovation promises diverse practical applications, further enriching the XRPL ecosystem.</p>



<p>While the proposal undergoes review and refinement, there is optimism regarding its potential <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-ddos-attack-ripple-regulatory-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on the XRP</a>. Ripple CTO David Schwartz said it could introduce a new utility layer without deterring traditional finance entities from its use.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;If passed, this could bring new utility to the XRPL. Together with the native DEX, this lending protocol forms a critical pillar in enabling more accessible, efficient, and transparent financial services,&#8221; Schwartz <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1778914095997313369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remarked</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, Schwartz also conceded that some companies might be reluctant to use the feature. He said these firms would be concerned about participating in an unregulated lending product.</p>

<p>This development follows a series of advancements within Ripple&#8217;s ecosystem. Last month, the network <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1771284874931925459?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">introduced </a>Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools, albeit facing launch challenges. Additionally, Ripple disclosed plans to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-launching-stablecoin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch a stablecoin</a> fully backed by US dollar deposits and other cash equivalents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Uniswap has hiked trading fees on its decentralized exchange by approximately 67%. This move comes in the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) potential legal actions against the DeFi protocol.</strong></p>



<p>Information on the official website shows that users will have to pay a fee of 0.25% for most swaps, up from the previous rate of 0.15%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-uniswap-raises-fees-to-prepare-for-legal-battle">Uniswap Raises Fees to Prepare For Legal Battle</h2>



<p>Uniswap <a href="https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/20131678274957-What-are-Uniswap-Labs-fees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">clarified</a> that this fee adjustment aims to ensure sustainable funding for its operations. Although fee-eligible trades have seen an uptick, certain transactions, such as swapping stablecoin pairs with identical underlying assets or wrapping and unwrapping WETH, remain exempt from fees.</p>



<p>Users can circumvent the fee by utilizing an alternative interface to access Uniswap. However, any transactions conducted on the mainnet and supported Layer 2 networks will incur the increased fee.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the fee revision coincides with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/will-sec-sue-uniswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap&#8217;s acknowledgment of a Wells notice</a>, a precursor to enforcement action, from the SEC. Consequently, market observers suggested that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/uniswap-governance-proposal-defi-token-price-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap&#8217;s transaction fee</a> increase was a strategic move to bolster its financial reserves in anticipation of the potential legal proceedings from the financial watchdog.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The interface fee goes to Uniswap Labs to fund the operations of the team building out products around the protocol&#8230; Or in this case, fight a lawsuit with the SEC on behalf of the entire industry If you do not want to pay the fee, then just use an aggregator. Normal users are better served with an aggregator anyway (hint, those often have their fees too),&#8221; Dan Smith, a researcher with crypto platform Blockwork Research <a href="https://twitter.com/smyyguy/status/1779201959313981527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-exchange-coinbase-binance-legal-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC&#8217;s litigation against crypto entities</a> tends to be protracted and financially burdensome.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>On April 13, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a substantial downturn, marked by a nearly 10% drop in Bitcoin and other digital currencies.</strong></p>



<p>This decline was instigated by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly Iran&#8217;s attack on Israel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-iran-s-attack-spurs-crypto-market-decline">Iran&#8217;s Attack Spurs Crypto Market Decline</h2>



<p>The crypto market experienced a significant price crash, with several <a href="https://beincrypto.com/million-liquidations-bitcoin-crypto-dip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">altcoins plunging by double digits</a> in response to Iran&#8217;s actions. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, for instance, saw a rapid decline of $6,000 within minutes of the attack, as the flagship digital asset tumbled from around $68,000 to as low as $60,800 before rebounding to $64,400 at the time of reporting.</p>



<p>Similarly, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-eth-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> dropped from around $3,200 to $2,800 before recovering to $3,000. Other assets such as BNB, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/solana-platforms-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a>, and Dogecoin also experienced declines of 5%, 8%, and 10% respectively over the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>These developments resulted in significant losses for traders. Data from Coinglass <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveals</a> that approximately $962.40 million was lost, predominantly by bullish position holders who suffered losses of $771.76 million. In comparison, short traders incurred losses of $199.63 million due to the market downturn.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="284" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70-850x284.png" alt="Crypto market liquidation" class="wp-image-500663" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70-850x284.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70-360x120.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70-768x256.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70-1536x513.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70-150x50.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-70.png 1546w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crypto Market Liquidation Heatmap.

<p>Furthermore, the DeFi sector witnessed liquidations exceeding $120 million, marking the highest point of liquidations this year, as per Parsec data. </p>



<p>Analyst at QCP Capital <a href="https://t.me/QCPbroadcast/1192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">attributed</a> the widespread sell-off to Bitcoin&#8217;s role as a weekend proxy macro hedge, exposing it to the full impact of immediate risk-off reactions. The firm noted that this situation presents an opportunity for traders to buy the dip, citing historical profitability in such scenarios during major geopolitical conflicts.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;After today&#8217;s sell-off, traders&#8217; unrealized profits (purple area) are at the lowest since early February (10%). Moreover, prices are nearer to the trader&#8217;s realized price of $58,000,&#8221; Moreno added.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/israel-palestine-war-impact-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tensions in the Middle East remain high</a>, with Iran issuing warnings of further attacks if Israel retaliates against its drone strikes.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solana developers have issued an urgent update to tackle the blockchain network&#8217;s ongoing congestion challenges.</strong></p>



<p>Anza, a prominent infrastructure developer, successfully deployed version 1.18.11 as a congestion fix to the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> devnet and invited validators to test its efficacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-network-fixes-target-congestion">Network Fixes Target Congestion</h2>



<p>The Solana-focused software development firm urged all testnet validators to upgrade their systems promptly to facilitate a thorough analysis of the impact of the proposed solution.</p>



<p>Over the past weeks, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-solana-transaction-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana has grappled</a> with elevated transaction failure rates, exacerbated by an influx of bots <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-solana-memecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploiting meme coin activity</a>. As a result, several Solana-based protocols were forced to <a href="https://x.com/myBIDOfficial/status/1777214799937732879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">postpone</a> their launch due to network congestion. </p>



<p>Notably, there are indications that the situation might be improving. Phantom, the foremost <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-solana-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wallet provider on Solana</a>, revealed that its transaction success rates have significantly improved.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;For the past 24 hours, our metrics show that transactions have been landing nearly 90% of the time, almost a 5x improvement from a week ago. Sending and swapping in Phantom should be much more reliable now. If you are still having issues, retrying should be a quick fix,&#8221; Phantom <a href="https://twitter.com/phantom/status/1778535513441652797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, Jacob Creech, the head of developer relations at the Solana Foundation, praised the network&#8217;s response to the congestion issues.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;In the 2022 network congestion, core engineers were the main contributors to fixing the problem. Now we have core engineers, dapps, validators, RPCs, developers, and more laser-focused on improving UX. Solana&#8217;s developer community is maturing. We will get past this and be even better for it,&#8221; Creech <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobvcreech/status/1778830160814285153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite improving the network&#8217;s transaction situation, Solana experienced a 12% decline during the past day. This pushed its price below $140 for the first time in a month. However, the decline mirrored a broader market downturn that prompted over <a href="https://beincrypto.com/million-liquidations-bitcoin-crypto-dip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$860 million in crypto liquidations</a> across major assets, including <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<p>This price movement marks a shock occurrence for Solana. SOL&#8217;s price has been on an uptrend, rising by around 50% year-to-date. But, it has considerably struggled since <a href="https://beincrypto.com/why-solana-broke-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peaking at above $200 in mid-March</a>, declining by more than 13% during the past week, according to BeInCrypto data. </p>

Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>These moves prompted market traders to warn that, depending on the success of the congestion fix, the current downtrend could see Solana&#8217;s price drop to as low as $120.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Going to be an interesting week for Solana. If that fix is working Monday, I can see us pump straight back to $200. If not, we&#8217;ll probably see more negative price action and possibly a fall to $120-130 ranges,&#8221; Crypto trader Thor <a href="https://x.com/Thorshammergems/status/1779018509533745468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Pro-crypto advocate and aspiring US Senate candidate John Deaton has outpaced incumbent Senator Elizabeth Warren in fundraising during the year&#8217;s first quarter.</strong></p>



<p>According to publicly available data from the Federal Election Commission, Deaton raised $1.36 million, surpassing Warren&#8217;s $1.1 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-community-throws-weight-behind-deaton">Crypto Community Throws Weight Behind Deaton</h2>



<p>Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett <a href="https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1778797246751904135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Deaton&#8217;s support base included several prominent figures in the crypto industry, including <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-sec-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple&#8217;s Brad Garlinghouse</a> and Chris Larsen, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-cardano-ada-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano&#8217;s Charles Hoskinson</a>, Gemini&#8217;s Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Bitcoin entrepreneur Jameson Loop.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-lawyer-elizabeth-warren-republican-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deaton launched an official campaign</a> to unseat Elizabeth Warren in the US Senate. Due to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/america-threat-crypto-claims-elizabeth-warren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren&#8217;s pronounced anti-crypto stance</a>, his campaign has drawn enormous support from industry leaders.</p>



<p>Warren has noticed Deaton&#8217;s momentum, as reports indicate she&#8217;s intensifying efforts to rally her donor base. The lawmaker reportedly <a href="https://x.com/eleanorterrett/status/1759700615788118168?s=46&amp;t=3iAFD_WHRWDFSLixlrJyWg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">portrayed</a> <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-lawyer-sec-mail-xrp-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deaton as a crypto advocate</a> aligned with the Republican Party, emphasizing her advocacy for stricter regulations on the industry.</p>

<p>While Elizabeth Warren asserts confidence in her ability to face any challenge, her outreach for donations suggests she recognizes the potential threat John Deaton poses. </p>



<p>Warren has successfully secured her Senate seat twice. During this period, she has <a href="https://beincrypto.com/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-army-grows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed several anti-crypto policies</a>, including a proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act to increase compliance within the emerging industry. Due to these moves, the lawmaker believes the crypto industry has placed a target on her back.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Deaton views himself as a credible contender, citing internal sources revealing Warren&#8217;s mention of him in various communications. He also alluded to a video featuring Warren and Karen Spilka joking about his book, hinting at his candidacy&#8217;s seriousness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Blockchain security firm CertiK has issued a cautionary notice regarding a possible vulnerability detected in Telegram&#8217;s Desktop applications. This raises concerns over users&#8217; potential exposure to malicious attacks.</strong></p>



<p>However, Telegram, known for its crypto-friendly messaging platform, has refuted these claims, asserting that such a vulnerability is absent within its system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alleged-vulnerability-on-telegram">Alleged Vulnerability on Telegram</h2>



<p>Certik claimed that Telegram&#8217;s desktop application, specifically its media processing functionality, contained a significant Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. It allegedly exposes users to attacks through media files like images or videos.</p>



<p>The firm specified that the vulnerability affects only desktop apps that execute programs contained within files. However, the mobile application remains unaffected.</p>



<p>Telegram swiftly responded to CertiK&#8217;s claims, <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1777677055837995151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a> that it could not verify the vulnerability and suggesting it could be misinformation. However, CertiK <a href="https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1778756245459255655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demonstrated</a> an RCE attack on Telegram&#8217;s latest Windows desktop version, reinforcing its initial claim. Consequently, it advised users to exercise caution until a complete resolution is reached.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We REPRODUCED one RCE attack to the latest TG Desktop on Windows (release version 4.16.6 x64).<br>All credits go to the original security researchers (github: el-garro) who reported the issue first. <a href="https://t.co/AJ6s1arjnB">pic.twitter.com/AJ6s1arjnB</a></p>&mdash; CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1778756245459255655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>CertiK recommends users review their Telegram settings and deactivate the auto-download feature to mitigate the vulnerability. Still, Telegram has since addressed CertiK&#8217;s renewed disclosure, citing a recent server-side fix for a similar issue. The firm clarified that the resolved vulnerability required specific user interactions and advanced conditions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Certik posted this after we notified them about a server-side fix for an issue which was similar to the one they initially hinted at (but required user interaction; required the user to have Python installed; and could not be triggered by automatic downloads),&#8221; Telegram <a href="https://x.com/telegram/status/1778748412973727945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Telegram is a widely used messenger platform recognized for its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/telegram-bot-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency-friendly environment</a>. The application enables users to communicate, exchange files, and conduct cryptocurrency transactions, including Bitcoin, through its custodial <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-wallet-for-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wallet</a> solution. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the last 24 hours, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and altcoins encountered significant volatility, resulting in a notable decline, with the overall crypto market capitalization dropping by approximately 8%, settling at $2.53 trillion.</strong></p>



<p>This swift market fluctuation may have taken many retail traders by surprise. However, insights from on-chain data reveal that certain large-scale investors, colloquially known as crypto whales, foresaw the downturn and offloaded a substantial portion of their holdings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-whales-offload-holdings">Crypto Whales Offload Holdings</h2>



<p>On-chain analysts <a href="https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1779036464791351741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that several institutional investors strategically sold portions of their holdings <a href="https://beincrypto.com/million-liquidations-bitcoin-crypto-dip/">during the market downturn</a>. Four crypto whales collectively offloaded  31,683 ETH, valued at approximately $106 million.</p>



<p>Among the identified crypto whales were notable entities such as Cumberland, an address linked to the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ftx-collapse-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bankrupt Alameda/FTX estate</a>, and two undisclosed <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-wallet-for-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">altcoin wallets</a>. </p>



<p>Cumberland, a prominent institutional crypto investment firm, deposited 17,206 ETH, amounting to $57.3 million, across various exchanges. On the other hand, two crypto whales, &#8216;0xC3f8&#8217; and &#8216;0x1717&#8217;, moved 7,976 ETH worth $26.6 million and 4,000 ETH  worth $13.32 million, respectively, to Binance and other exchanges. </p>



<p>Similarly, the FTX/Alameda estate transferred 2,500 ETH, valued at around $8.33 million. Interestingly, this is not the first time the failed exchange has effectively been able to time the market before drastic sell-offs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Since March 1, FTX and Alameda have deposited 15,850 ETH, worth $58 million into centralized exchanges at roughly $3,659, and dramatic price changes tended to follow afterward,&#8221; blockchain firm SpotOnChain <a href="https://x.com/spotonchain/status/1778962293235360056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>These significant trading activities exerted additional selling pressure on the market, contributing to the downturn. During the reporting period, Ethereum&#8217;s price dropped by 13%. It went from $3,500 to reach as low as $3,062 for the first time in nearly a month. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> experienced a sharp decline, plunging to as low as $65,100. Although the leading cryptocurrency has slightly rebounded to around $68,000 at press time, its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">volatility</a> led to a decrease in market capitalization to $1.3 trillion. According to <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a> from CompaniesMarketCap, this positions Bitcoin behind Meta, the parent company of Facebook, in the global ranking of top assets.</p>



<p>Regardless, computer scientist Edward Snowden ridiculed the industry&#8217;s reaction to the recent dip, noting that the price of Bitcoin had remained relatively stable during the week.</p>

<p><strong>Ripple&#8217;s (XRP) price will likely make its way out of the potential bearishness it is doomed to witness.</strong></p>



<p>This will likely occur with the help of Bitcoin, which is expected to rise ahead of the halving event this month.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-has-the-potential-to-rally">Ripple Has the Potential to Rally.</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-crypto-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price will follow the cues</a> of the biggest cryptocurrency on the planet, Bitcoin. This is because the latter is due for a major rally due to the halving event set to occur towards the end of this month.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin price increases, the highly correlated assets will also probably take on the bullishness and witness an increase. XRP is among those altcoins, as it could potentially rally as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/V03NWxWS-850x363.png" alt="XRP correlation to Bitcoin.

<p>The chances of this happening within the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-crypto-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple network are also high</a>, given there is room for further profits. The overall supply-bearing gains at the moment are at 83%, far lower than the threshold of the conditions forming a market top.</p>

<p>Only when an asset&#8217;s 95% of the circulating supply is in profit is a market top formed; otherwise, the potential for a rally is high.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-850x288.png" alt="XRP Supply in Profit." class="wp-image-500394" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/XRP-Ledger-XRP-20.37.49-12-Apr-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">XRP Supply in Profit.

<p> Thus, the XRP price could benefit from these conditions to chart gains in the coming days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-prediction-a-bullish-breakout">XRP Price Prediction: A Bullish Breakout</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-correction-downtrend-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price trading at $0.5951</a> is currently attempting to stay above the upper trend line of the descending triangle pattern the altcoin was stuck in. Since last month, the descending triangle pattern is a bearish chart formation. Characterized by a flat support level and declining resistance, it indicates a potential continuation of a downtrend when the price breaks below the support level.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-price-correction-looms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price managed to break out of it</a>, nearly securing $0.6064 as a support floor. This coincides with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement of $0.8199 to $0.4744. Should the Ripple token manage to reclaim 38.2% Fib, it could rally towards $0.6500.</p>

<p>But if the altcoin falls back into the bearish pattern, it will fall through the lower trend line. This would send it to the 23.6% Fib level marked at $0.5559, invalidating the bearish thesis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Polygon (MATIC) price is facing potential correction owing to growing bearishness among investors.</strong></p>



<p>This sentiment has intensified to the point where even whales have opted to reduce their holdings and book profits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polygon-investors-move-to-sell">Polygon Investors Move to Sell</h2>



<p>MATIC price is flashing a bearish signal, and investors react to it rather strongly. This is evident from the substantial drop in network growth. This indicator measures the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network, indicating the overall traction of the project among investors.</p>

<p>At the moment, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-matic-network-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon&#8217;s network growth</a> is at a seven-month low, which means that MATIC&#8217;s adoption is taking a massive hit.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not just potential investors exhibiting skepticism but also existing MATIC holders. Large wallet holders are dumping their holdings, with over 19 million MATIC worth over $16 million moved to exchanges. Most of these addresses are whales holding between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of MATIC.</p>

<p>The decline in these investors&#8217; supply is considered a major signal as any potential for recovery becomes invalidated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matic-price-prediction-look-out-for-a-drop">MATIC Price Prediction: Look out for a Drop</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-matic-breakout-1-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MATIC price is currently witnessing a consistent drawdown</a>, bringing it closer to the critical support of $0.7489. Given the aforementioned market cues, it is likely that the Polygon native token will lose this support.</p>



<p>Consequently, MATIC price would fall by 11.63% to test the support of $0.7422. If the altcoin falls below it, the support level of $0.7000 will be tested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="363" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/5ENSmPBU-850x363.png" alt="MATIC/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>However, the DeFi token is also in a falling wedge, which could reverse the outcome. A falling wedge is a bullish chart pattern characterized by declining price highs and lows, converging towards a narrower range, typically indicating a potential reversal to the upside.</p>

<p>Thus, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-matic-price-correction-consolidation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MATIC price could invalidate</a> the bearish thesis if it notes a reversal and reclaims $0.8876.</p>

<p><strong>In a landmark legal action, former Amazon engineer Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to three years in prison for orchestrating hacks on two DeFi cryptocurrency exchanges, resulting in over $12 million theft. </strong></p>



<p>US District Judge Victor Marrero handed down the sentence, marking a significant milestone in crypto-related law enforcement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-defi-hacker-sentenced-to-3-years-in-prison">DeFi Hacker Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison</h2>



<p>Shakeeb Ahmed utilized his extensive knowledge in reverse engineering and blockchain audits to manipulate smart contracts on the exchanges. US Attorney Damian Williams <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-security-engineer-sentenced-three-years-prison-hacking-two-decentralized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">states</a> this case represents the first-ever conviction for hacking a smart contract. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison — and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto — is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks,&#8221; Williams emphasized.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On July 2 and 3, 2022, Ahmed targeted the first exchange by injecting fake pricing data, generating $9 million in inflated fees, which he then illicitly withdrew. In a subsequent communication with the exchange, Ahmed agreed to return the stolen funds except for $1.5 million, provided the exchange did not report the attack to law enforcement.</p>



<p>A few weeks later, on July 28, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nirvana-finance-hacker-surrenders-millions-pleading-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in Nirvana</a> Finance’s smart contracts. This second attack drained Nirvana of approximately $3.6 million, nearly all its funds, forcing the platform to shut down. Ahmed declined Nirvana&#8217;s substantial bug bounty offer, opting to keep the stolen assets.</p>

<p>Ahmed engaged in sophisticated laundering techniques to obscure the origins of the stolen funds. These included swapping tokens across blockchains, converting assets into the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/monero-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">untraceable crypto Monero</a>, and utilizing overseas exchanges and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-bitcoin-mixers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency mixers</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to prison time, the court has ordered Ahmed to forfeit around $12.3 million in stolen assets. He must also pay restitution exceeding $5 million to the affected exchanges. He will also undergo three years of supervised release post-incarceration.</p>

<p><strong>Chainlink&#8217;s (LINK) price is currently stuck in a bearish continuation pattern that could result in a considerable decline.</strong></p>



<p>Investors are not particularly optimistic either, which could result in LINK failing any potential recovery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chainlink-investors-could-sell">Chainlink Investors Could Sell</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price is falling lower</a> daily due to broader market conditions. Such bearish market conditions are sometimes flipped into bullish ones by the activity of the investors. However, this is not the case with LINK.</p>



<p>Active addresses, i.e., addresses conducting transactions on the network, have hit a new low after declining for the past couple of days. In the last 24 hours, less than 3,500 investors have participated in Chainlink, the lowest figure since October 2023.</p>

<p>This shows that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-etf-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LINK holders are not particularly optimistic</a> at the moment, extending their bearish behavior.</p>

<p>Furthermore, daily price active addresses divergence, which flashes a sell signal at the time of writing. During instances when the price stays strong and participation declines, selling becomes highly probable.</p>

<p>Additionally, this is the strongest sell signal noticed in the past year, which directly hints at the potential selling that is about to come.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-link-price-prediction-expect-a-decline">LINK Price Prediction: Expect a Decline</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-token-profit-on-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s current price</a> is set to see a considerable drawdown owing to the descending triangle pattern it is stuck in. A descending triangle is a bearish chart pattern characterized by a horizontal support line and descending trendline, indicating potential further downside as selling pressure increases within a narrowing price range.</p>



<p>Based on this pattern, the downside target for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-link-price-correction-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price is $11.98</a>, which would mark an almost 30% correction for the investors.</p>

<p>However, halving induces bullishness in the market, and LINK follows the cue, so it could break out of the pattern. This would rally towards $18.73 and beyond, invalidating the bearish cues.</p>
