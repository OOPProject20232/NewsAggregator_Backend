										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has reportedly raised $12 million to develop a new layer-3 blockchain. The team secured this fund through the sale of its upcoming token, TREAT, to non-US venture capital firms. </strong></p>



<p>Notably, investors included Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands, among others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-plans-to-build-a-layer-3-blockchain-on-top-of-shibarium">Shiba Inu Plans to Build a Layer-3 Blockchain on Top of Shibarium</h2>



<p>Initiated a few months back, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/pacquiao-foundation-onboards-shibarium-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fundraising concluded</a> earlier this month. According to reports, the team executed fundraising in tranches, reaching valuations of $75 million, $100 million, and $200 million.</p>



<p>The TREAT token will serve as both the utility and governance token of Shiba Inu&#8217;s forthcoming layer-3 blockchain. This new platform is being constructed on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-tvl-increases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top of Shibarium</a>, the project&#8217;s <a href="https://beincrypto.com/vaneck-predict-1trillion-ethereum-layer-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum layer-2</a> blockchain. </p>



<p>Readers should note that the Shiba Inu team has not yet launched the TREAT token. Any other token circulating with the same ticker, are fake.</p>



<p>Highlighting a commitment to privacy, the blockchain integrates fully homomorphic encryption technology from cryptography firm Zama.</p>

<p>The raised funds will be channeled into the development of the layer-3 blockchain. This blockchain is expected to enhance the capabilities of the Shiba Inu ecosystem significantly. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;This new encryption chain aims to address multiple issues in crypto, including privacy and trust for Shiba Inu&#8217;s extensive community of tens of millions and the next billion crypto-curious individuals,&#8221; Shiba Inu <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/290068/shiba-inu-funding-treat-token-new-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking ahead, Shiba Inu plans to expand its ecosystem with the introduction of a new token, Shi. The team has scheduled its release later this year. </p>



<p>Moreover, the launch of the new <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-layer-3-fastest-tps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layer-3 blockchain</a> testnet has been scheduled for the third quarter of this year. A mainnet release will follow after thorough testing. </p>



<p>Currently, the ecosystem includes SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens. Each token serves a unique function within the network, with LEASH providing special benefits to Shiba Inu&#8217;s most dedicated supporters. Despite the positive developments, there has been no significant impact on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/billion-shiba-inu-burned-price-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the price of SHIB</a> in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>He attributed the disruption to networking issues among the validators. Finally, the network is now operational, although some services may remain down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In a recent exposé, blockchain investigator ZachXBT unveiled that 12 Solana-based meme coin projects have been abandoned, leading to a staggering $26.7 million loss for investors. </strong></p>



<p>These meme coins were initially promoted through presales, promising substantial returns. However, they soon left their backers with tokens that became nearly worthless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-crypto-founders-stole-26-7-million-through-presales">How Crypto Founders Stole $26.7 Million Through Presales</h2>



<p>The most notorious of these projects was &#8220;I like this coin,&#8221; with the ticker symbol – LIKE. It attracted approximately $7.8 million in Solana (SOL) from investors. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/FuemMjepntbzthvSEVmDGnfq7YWr8UebZrAXJrP46VtF?t=1713770849823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a> from DEXTools, the coin&#8217;s value plummeted by over 50% since the launch. Moreover, there has been minimum communication from the creators.</p>



<p>Similarly, the MOONKE token faced a catastrophic decline. It <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/8xjo894p1FvCKhZ8QtuRN745MCsfkazRJrxucTFsCrqL?t=1713771182560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crashed</a> by more than 80% soon after its release. These cases illustrate the risky nature of investing in hyped crypto ventures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a study by cybersecurity firm Blockaid revealed that at least 50% of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-presale-tokens-malicious-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presale tokens on the Solana blockchain from November 2023 to February 2024 were malicious</a>. Blockaid&#8217;s co-founder, Ido Ben-Natan, attributed this surge in fraudulent activities to the increased popularity of presale tokens. </p>



<p>Scammers have exploited <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-warns-fomo-bitcoin-etf-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investor FOMO (fear of missing out)</a> by mimicking legitimate transactions and creating sophisticated fake websites.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Firstly, the exponential increase in pre-sale token uptake in February and March, fueled by the popularity of legitimate meme coins, has provided fertile ground for scammers,” Ben-Natan explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Individuals known as Jared_eth and Bluekirbyftm have been identified as some of the culprits behind these operations.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Solana blockchain has seen the rise of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/racist-memecoins-condemnation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coins with offensive and racist themes</a>, which has led to severe backlash from the crypto community. These developments have intensified calls for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/indonesia-strict-crypto-regulation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stricter regulations</a> and enhanced security protocols to safeguard investors from these increasingly complex scams.</p>

<p>Investors should exercise increased caution and due diligence. It is crucial to look for projects with transparent, accountable leadership and verifiable support. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, the need for robust protective measures and informed investment strategies becomes more apparent. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Chainlink&#8217;s (LINK) price felt the bullishness of the Bitcoin halving event more than BTC itself, which was visible in its 20% rally.</strong></p>



<p>The altcoin, however, is now facing a crucial barrier, which has been a challenge in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chainlink-investors-might-move-to-sell">Chainlink Investors Might Move to Sell</h2>



<p>As Chainlink&#8217;s price rose, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LINK investors regained their profits</a>, which might be a key factor driving them to sell. The recent correction brought the total LINK supply in profit down from 84% to 70%.</p>



<p>This 14% supply represents nearly 82.18 million LINK worth nearly $1.3 billion. All of this supply has once again returned to its original state before the decline. In the past two days, the profitable supply rose by 13% to reach 84% at the time of writing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-850x288.png" alt="Chainlink Supply in Profit.

Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is a good thing, it is also a potential trigger for selling, as investors want to secure their gains to prevent losses from another decline. This would drive Chainlink&#8217;s price lower.</p>

<p>The Market Value substantiates this sentiment to the Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio tracks investor gains/losses. Chainlink&#8217;s 7-day MVRV of 11% suggests profit, possibly prompting sales. Historically, BTC corrects at MVRV levels of 8% to 15%, labeling it a danger zone.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/link-primed-for-recovery-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price was noted to rally by 20% over the weekend</a>, bringing the digital asset to trade at $15.8.

<p>Even though The altcoin manages to close above it, it falls back down from the $15.6 resistance to test the support at $14.6 and $13.4. If LINK holders move to sell this time, the potential decline will result in a test of the latter support level should the former break.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the dynamic crypto ecosystem, meme coins seem to dodge the regulatory hurdles that impede more substantive cryptos. While tokens like Dogecoin, born from humor, thrive, entrepreneurs eager to launch utilitarian cryptos face daunting challenges. </strong></p>



<p>This imbalance raises critical questions about US crypto regulations and their impact on innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andreessen-horowitz-general-partner-criticizes-us-crypto-regulations">Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Criticizes US Crypto Regulations</h2>



<p>Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz leading their crypto fund, has <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/memecoins-tokens-regulation-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">criticized</a> the existing regulatory practices. He points out that these regulations facilitate the proliferation of meme coins at the expense of more innovative, blockchain-based solutions. </p>



<p>According to Dixon, the US crypto regulation unintentionally encourages launching <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coins</a> because they lack practical utility, thus evading the stringent scrutiny applied to potentially transformative technologies.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;It’s actually safer to release a meme coin today with no use case than it is to launch a token that’s useful. Think about it this way: We’d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivized only GameStop meme stocks but that rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA — all companies with products people use daily,&#8221; Dixon wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?</a></strong></p>



<p>This regulatory paradox is clear in the relative ease of creating and launching meme coins. This is because meme coins often do not require a team of developers or a legitimate business plan. They thrive on community engagement and internet culture, often gaining value from sheer speculation rather than underlying utility.</p>



<p>Conversely, developers aiming to introduce blockchain tokens with practical applications encounter a maze of compliance issues. These tokens could revolutionize payment systems, digital authenticity, and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/a16z-decentralized-governance-machiavellian-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized governance</a> but often find themselves mired in what Dixon describes as &#8220;regulatory purgatory.&#8221; </p>



<p>Additionally, recent initiatives by <a href="https://beincrypto.com/a16z-new-funds-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andreessen Horowitz, such as its massive $7.2 billion fundraising</a> aimed at sectors like infrastructure and gaming, demonstrate a firm commitment to the potential of these technologies to drive future growth. This is supported by its active role in advocating for regulatory reforms that could level the playing field for serious crypto projects versus meme coins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-s-approach-to-crypto-hinders-innovation">SEC&#8217;s Approach to Crypto Hinders Innovation</h2>



<p>The primary challenge stems from the application of the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nba-top-shot-nfts-howey-test-securities-us-judge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Howey test by the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC). Established in 1946, this test determines if a crypto qualifies as a security. Its broad interpretation in the context of modern digital assets has been a point of contention.</p>



<p>Despite their decentralized nature, only a few projects like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereumized-good-bad-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a> have been recognized by the SEC as not involving managerial efforts, exempting them from certain regulatory requirements. The lack of clear guidelines has led to what many in the crypto sector describe as &#8220;<a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-chairman-crypto-enforcements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulation by enforcement</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The call for clearer regulations isn&#8217;t isolated to Dixon&#8217;s observations. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-leaders-support-uniswap-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leaders across the crypto sector have voiced</a> similar concerns. </p>



<p>For instance, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Haun Ventures CEO Kathryn Haun have publicly criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach, particularly its recent <a href="https://beincrypto.com/will-sec-sue-uniswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actions against platforms like Uniswap</a>. They argue that the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; creates uncertainty that stifles innovation and equity within the industry.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy estate is preparing for a pivotal move by auctioning a significant batch of Solana (SOL) tokens. This strategy forms part of FTX&#8217;s liquidation process initiated after its collapse in November 2022. </strong></p>



<p>The upcoming auction, which diverges from previous fixed-price sales, is a strategic shift signaling potential changes in market dynamics. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-crypto-community-participate-in-the-solana-auction">Will the Crypto Community Participate in the Solana Auction?</h2>



<p>Previously, between <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftx-sold-30-million-solana-sol-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25 million and 30 million SOL tokens were sold</a>, netting nearly $1.9 billion. These were priced at $64 each, a sharp 60% discount from the market price then. However, the discount came with a trade-off, i.e., the buyers had to lock their SOL for four years.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Basically you’re exchanging time for a discount — you have to lock up your capital for four years, but you get to pay much less for the tokens,” Eva Weng, from Caladan, said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/auctions-drive-nft-growth-abridged-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opt for an auction</a> this time around could foster competitive bidding, possibly influencing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sol-price-upswing-on-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana&#8217;s market price</a>. Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Markets, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcagney/status/1781804464028139848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the auction, but the final details are still under wraps. </p>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Buy Solana (SOL) and Everything You Need To Know</a></strong></p>



<p>Cagney&#8217;s Figure Markets is developing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate the crypto community&#8217;s participation in the auction. This mechanism is designed to attract both non-US and accredited US investors. It allows them to engage in community consensus to decide on bid prices and manage subsequent investments. </p>



<p>The auction format might escalate bidding fervor, with a probability of implications on Solana’s pricing trends.</p>



<p>Currently, Solana&#8217;s price trajectory is on a possible upturn. After reaching a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/why-solana-broke-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high of $210 on March 18, the Solana price</a> dropped significantly by over 44%, hitting a low of around $116 on April 13. Nevertheless, it has rebounded, trading nearly 30% higher from that low. </p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-dexs-volume-resurgen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This recovery is crucial</a> as Solana tests major resistance levels near $156. This level is significant, marking a key Fibonacci retracement point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="493" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-850x493.png" alt="Solana (SOL) Price Performance" class="wp-image-503173" style="aspect-ratio:1.7241379310344827;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-850x493.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-360x209.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-768x445.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-1536x891.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-2048x1188.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-150x87.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Solana (SOL) Price Performance.

<p>If Solana manages to maintain a position above $156, it could see a rise of 22% to approximately $185, tapping into the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Conversely, if it fails to overcome this barrier, the price might find support at $145.56.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain is undergoing a historic transformation, spearheaded by the introduction of the Runes token standard. </strong></p>



<p>This new development enhances the functionality of Bitcoin by enabling the creation of fungible tokens. It also significantly boosts transaction fees and miner revenue, reshaping the economic landscape of the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altcoins-on-bitcoin-mark-a-new-milestone">Altcoins on Bitcoin Mark a New Milestone</h2>



<p>Lucas Outumuro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, recently <a href="https://x.com/LucasOutumuro/status/1782089893327388711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> the seismic impact of Runes, describing it as &#8220;absolutely insane.&#8221; He pointed to the surge in daily fees which reached a record $80 million. This is about four times higher than the previous all-time high set in December 2017.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the average <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-protocol-runes-clogs-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin transaction fee has skyrocketed</a> to $128, a figure that starkly overshadows the $30 peak during the initial frenzy over Ordinals. </p>



<p>This surge in fees has been a boon for miners, who despite a 50% drop in inflationary rewards due to the halving, saw their earnings spike by 1,200% following <a href="https://beincrypto.com/new-protocol-altcoin-creation-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Runes launch</a>. The sudden spike lead to a record <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-miners-revenue-rune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 million in Bitcoin mining revenue</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="567" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-850x567.png" alt="Bitcoin Transaction Fees" class="wp-image-503157" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-850x567.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-360x240.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-768x512.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-150x100.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Transaction Fees.

<p>Still, the introduction of Runes coincided with a significant downturn in new Bitcoin addresses, which have hit a two-year low. According to Outumuro, this indicates that the current surge is driven predominantly by seasoned crypto enthusiasts, with retail investors yet to join the fray.</p>



<p>The traditional finance sector, particularly Wall Street, was caught off guard by these developments. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/marathon-digital-mine-btc-monthly-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stocks like Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA)</a> and Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw over a 20% decline in the month leading up to the halving, underestimating the potential of Runes and the adaptability of the crypto market.</p>

<p>This historic network transformation suggests a solution to Bitcoin&#8217;s long-standing security challenges, propelled by what many in the industry refer to as &#8220;shitcoins.&#8221; As this trend continues, the real test will be its sustainability and whether the early momentum can be maintained.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the cryptocurrency market, the latest halving event has surprisingly not put Bitcoin in the spotlight. Instead, meme coins, particularly those with canine themes, have surged dramatically over the weekend. </strong></p>



<p>Following the halving late Friday, which reduced miner rewards by 50%, Bitcoin has seen modest gains. However, meme coins like BONK and FLOKI have experienced remarkable price increases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meme-coins-on-the-rise">Meme Coins on the Rise</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-solana-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana-based meme coin</a> BONK led the rally with an impressive 46% increase, reaching a price of $0.000022. This marks a significant recovery for BONK, which saw a substantial drop earlier in April. </p>



<p>Other notable performers include Ethereum-based FLOKI, which soared nearly 26% to $0.00018, and Shiba Inu (SHIB), climbing 24% to over $0.000028.</p>

<p>These gains contrast with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-bear-market-before-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin’s relatively stable post-halving</a> performance, which has seen only a 1.5% increase to just below $65,000. This subdued movement follows a record high of $73,805 set in March, driven by the anticipation and launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). </p>



<p>Historically, Bitcoin’s most substantial gains have materialized months after halving events, suggesting potential future growth.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The 2024 halving will showcase Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience and the market&#8217;s maturity, with less volatility observed due to institutional involvement and the ETF introduction. Predictions for the next halving include a potential for less pronounced short-term price fluctuations, but a significant long-term price appreciation, likely surpassing all-time highs,&#8221; Hao Yang, Head of Financial Products at Bybit, told BeInCrypto. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) bots have become one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrencies. However, cybersecurity analysts have uncovered one designed to steal crypto<a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>private keys.</strong></p>



<p>In an April 20 post on social media platform X, pseudonymous security researcher dm557 flagged the nefarious project on GitHub.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-ai-bot-steals-crypto">How This AI Bot Steals Crypto</h2>



<p>According to dm557&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/dm557/status/1781671693746077923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">findings</a>, the ai bot includes a &#8220;checkrug.py&#8221; file containing a binary encrypted script that decrypts data and transmits private keys. In crypto, private keys serve as the digital signatures for transactions. If these keys fall into the wrong hands, it can lead to substantial losses.</p>



<p>Evilcos, the pseudonymous founder of SlowMist, a prominent blockchain&nbsp;security&nbsp;firm, corroborated these findings and explained how the trading bot operated. He noted that the bot has a backdoor code that executes to steal the private keys of its users.</p>



<p>Notably, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/cyber-security-avoid-crypto-wallet-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security expert warned</a> the crypto community to be careful when they see complex codes because they could be used to cover malicious intent.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;If you are not familiar with the code, you need to be alert when you see fancy codes (&#8220;garbled code&#8221;), because there may be something fishy hidden. Crypto is all about open source. If it is open source, it is eager to provide highly readable code. Who would bother with these fancy codes?,&#8221; Evilcos <a href="https://twitter.com/evilcos/status/1781857393259020349?s=46&amp;t=3iAFD_WHRWDFSLixlrJyWg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remarked</a>.</p>

<p>It appears the project&#8217;s developer has removed the backdoor code as of press time. Nonetheless, experts have warned against downloading the ai bot because removing the malicious code might be a ploy to lure more unsuspecting users into downloading it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The author has deleted the backdoor and is working hard to update it. Once more people use it, backdoors may be added at any time.

<p>Remarkably, the author&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/greysign1/status/1781709226857153006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blocked</a> attempts to flag the project as risky by deleting a message stating it has a backdoor.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/mt-gox-bitcoin-payout-trigger-sell-off/">Mt. Gox’s 142,000 Bitcoin Payout Could Trigger a Sell-Off</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The trustee overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox has reportedly taken a significant step forward in facilitating Bitcoin repayments.</strong></p>



<p>Several users of the social media platform Reddit reported that Mt. Gox&#8217;s official website was amended to include crypto payment options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mt-gox-s-bitcoin-payout">Mt. Gox&#8217;s Bitcoin Payout</h2>



<p>The recent update has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/1c7x0hq/table_updated_0419224_kraken_usa_elsp_z2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sparked</a> mixed reactions among creditors. While some remain skeptical, others speculate that the crypto exchange might initiate repayments sooner than expected, potentially concluding before October 31, 2024. </p>



<p>The repayment plan entails distributing 142,000 Bitcoin (BTC), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and 69 billion Yen to creditors.</p>



<p>If the repayment plan proceeds as anticipated, industry analysts anticipate significant selling pressure in October as creditors liquidate their assets. This anticipation stems from the prolonged wait of Mt. Gox&#8217;s creditors, spanning nearly a decade since the exchange&#8217;s collapse.</p>



<p>Notably, progress on the repayment front has been observed, particularly with bank account reimbursements. Reports emerged in late December 2023 regarding the first <a href="https://beincrypto.com/mt-gox-repays-first-round-creditors-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mt. Gox repayments</a>, with some creditors even receiving double payments.</p>

<p>In 2014, a massive hack targeted Mt. Gox, once a trailblazer in the crypto industry. This resulted in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/are-the-missing-mt-gox-billions-on-their-way-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the loss of 850,000 Bitcoin</a>, which now holds a value exceeding $57 billion. Following the hack, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection and initiated rehabilitation proceedings in 2018 to compensate affected creditors. </p>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/mt-gox-preps-to-make-repayments-by-oct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays and uncertainties plagued the process</a> due to legal disputes and other setbacks, leaving users in limbo regarding the return of their funds.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the repayment development follows a warning issued by Mt. Gox to creditors regarding potential <a href="https://beincrypto.com/email-phishing-scam-crypto-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fraudulent emails.</a> According to the team, the emails, purportedly from the Rehabilitation Trustee, falsely advanced the repayment deadline to March 29, 2023, and urged recipients to click on a malicious link to verify their identity.</p>

<p>Consequently, MT. Gox swiftly clarified that these emails were fraudulent and not from its team.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;This email is a fraudulent email impersonating the MTGOX team. The fraudulent email was not sent by the Rehabilitation Trustee, and the information in the fraudulent email is completely false. Accordingly, please disregard the instructions and requests in the fraudulent email,&#8221; the firm <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20240417_announcement_en.pdf">added</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>A cohort of FTX investors and customers have settled their civil case against Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced and convicted founder of the failed crypto exchange.</strong></p>



<p>Now, Bankman-Fried agreed to cooperate with the creditors by providing non-privileged documents and information concerning other defendants. In return, the creditors will drop their civil action against the embattled founder and focus on other implicated parties in the exchange&#8217;s failure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-bankman-fried-called-out-crypto-influencers">Sam Bankman-Fried Called Out Crypto Influencers</h2>



<p>The creditors intend to leverage the shared information in their class action lawsuits. So, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/sam-bankman-fried-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> will provide information on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nfl-trevor-lawrence-ftx-promotion-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the exchange celebrity promoters</a>, including Shaquille O&#8217;Neil, Tom Brady, Katy Perry, and Naomi Osaka. </p>



<p>He will also give insights into FTX interactions with other entities, such as the legal firm Sullivan and Cromwell, venture capital firms Sino, K5 Global, Multicoin, Deltec Bank, and accounting firm Prager.</p>



<p>Creditors seek additional details on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sports-leagues-sued-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX&#8217;s engagements</a> with the Golden State Warriors, Formula 1 Racing, and Major League Baseball. <span>Moreover, they want information on firms such as the Mercedes Benz Group Racing Team, Creators Agency, and Lincoln Holdings.</span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Upon request by Class Representatives, [Sam Bankman-Fried] shall voluntarily provide documents and information, to the extent such documents and information are reasonably accessible to him without service of a subpoena, upon reasonable notice, and provide truthful declarations or affidavits upon request,&#8221; the filing read.</p>

<p>Sunil Kavuri, a prominent FTX creditor, described the agreement as a major win for customers. According to him, FTX liquidators, spearheaded by CEO John Ray and the legal firm <a href="https://beincrypto.com/judge-allows-sullivan-cromwell-to-litigate-in-ftx-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</a>, have impeded the class action endeavors. </p>



<p>Consequently, the settlement with Bankman-Fried aims to unearth more insights to litigate against any accomplices involved in the exchange&#8217;s collapse.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;[The] truth [will] prevail [and] co-conspirators will be held accountable,&#8221; Kavuri <a href="https://twitter.com/sunil_trades/status/1781935884570431655?s=46&amp;t=aw6ZR-6aD050XLPVXY8AQA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bankman-Fried was convicted and subsequently <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-to-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced to 25 years in prison</a>. The court ruled that he diverted customer funds from FTX to its affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research. These funds were allegedly used for political contributions, high-end real estate purchases, and speculative ventures.</p>
