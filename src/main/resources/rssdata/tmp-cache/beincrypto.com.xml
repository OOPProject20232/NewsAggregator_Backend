<p><strong>In a bold move to drive innovation in the decentralized identity (DID) sector, Ontology has launched a $10 million initiative designed to empower and expand the use of its ONT and ONG tokens.</strong> </p>



<p>This significant financial commitment aims to enhance the adoption and development of decentralized identity solutions within the ecosystem, leading to a remarkable 26% increase in Ontology&#8217;s market price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ontology-invites-creatives-to-educate-on-did-with-new-funding">Ontology Invites Creatives to Educate on DID With New Funding</h2>



<p>Ontology&#8217;s new fund seeks to educate and engage various stakeholders through a series of targeted initiatives. The community-focused strategy includes substantial support for content creation aimed at demystifying DID. </p>



<p>Specifically, <a href="https://\https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-10-million-boost-for-decentralized-identity-innovation-884b5936f67c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ontology calls on creatives and educators</a>—from writers and filmmakers to event organizers—to produce educational materials catering to all knowledge levels, from beginners to advanced users.</p>



<p>In addition to educational efforts, Ontology is enhancing its flagship ONT ID service. The platform is rolling out a range of tutorials that provide step-by-step guidance on implementing and utilizing ONT ID, ensuring that new and seasoned users can effectively engage with this technology. </p>



<p>These resources are designed to improve user experience and expand the technical understanding of Ontology&#8217;s offerings.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ontology-ont-sees-26-price-increase">Ontology (ONT) Sees 26% Price Increase</h2>



<p>While the news is a positive move forward for the project, Ontology (ONT) has experienced a significant 26% price increase over the past 24 hours. The price chart illustrates a bullish streak with an upward trajectory in recent trading sessions.</p>



<p>Additionally, this chart showcases a green candlestick surge, indicating strong buying pressure. The accompanying <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Relative Strength Index</a> (RSI), a momentum oscillator, sits above the midline and under the overbought threshold, signaling growing investor confidence yet not reaching market sentiment extremes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with such a price increase, investors and analysts are closely watching ONT’s next moves. Will the price consolidate these gains, or is there room for further growth? </p>



<p>Finally, the market&#8217;s enthusiasm and keen interest in decentralized applications suggest that ONT could maintain its positive momentum in the near term. </p>

<p>This gap is minimized by the introduction of easy-to-understand courses on trading. Lai says OKX understands derivatives are, by nature, relatively niche-oriented and are highly leveraged. This means that it is relatively riskier than other forms of trading. </p>
<p>Therefore, to minimize this risk, OKX puts extra effort into educating their users so their capital is protected against at least avoidable losses. Secondly, OKX also puts extra effort into simplifying the User Experience and Interface, thereby ensuring the process of executing trades is as simple as it can be. </p>

<p>Therefore, it does not mean “one size fits all” when it comes to responding to regulations; you have to work with the authorities to come up with a solution. As a result, it is a very time-consuming process, but it’s a process that OKX is prepared for and has a lot of data that it can share with regulators to come to a settlement. </p>
<p>So, regulations cannot speed up; they will take their course to be completed, and OKX is prepared to do whatever it takes to reach a successful dialogue between the stakeholders. </p>

<p>In fact, at the current status, the liquidity market status of altcoins is sufficient, and as far as their trading on OKX is concerned, their trade execution comprises a fair number. But in the coming years, it is difficult to project because a lot of altcoin trading happens in a two-way bilateral agreement instead of trading on exchanges. </p>

    <div class="text-grey-600  p4 md:p3 md:p3--ns"><p>During the discussion, Zhou was asked what his views were about the latest bull run, which started in February. </p>
<p>As per Zhou, one of the leading driving forces behind this bull market is institutional money, which started to flow once there was clarity from the regulators. As institutions started to enter, others followed and entered the space they previously did not. </p>
<p>Therefore, the main driving force is the institutions, and the second reason includes the development of financial infrastructure, which was completed after the fall of FTX because earlier, there simply was not any appropriate infrastructure for institutions to enter the space. </p>
<p>Good infrastructure means improvement not only in exchange improvement but also in risk management and system resilience. Considering this, the current bull run had all the reasons to come into effect, and so it did. </p>

The MiCA regulations will start to effect at the end of this year. </p>
<p>To overcome this, Bybit’s first step is to seek licenses in different parts of the world, which is why we have already applied for a license in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Bybit’s next step is to build web3 products, which is also something many other platforms are doing, including OKX and Binance. </p>
<p>This will allow European users to explore different options that Web3 offers in general, and for that, Bybit will offer a self-custody wallet. These self-custody wallets will offer a lot of things that are relevant to web3.</p>

<p>To become one of the top exchanges, Bybit is working on shortening the latency, which helps us to become more institutional grade and, therefore in return, helps us to grow our liquidity. </p>

By monitoring their frameworks, Jeremy helps to understand and work towards how those frameworks can be included within the Web 3 applications and blockchain technology in general. </p>
<p>Jeremy believes that as more and more applications coincide between Web 2 and Web 3, the growth is likely to be incredible. </p>

One of the biggest reasons behind the US taking a strict stance over cryptocurrencies is that securities regulations are having a difficult time understanding the crypto world as a whole. </p>
<p>The main reason is the whole ICO mania way back in 2016, where no one knew where things fell and under whose jurisdiction. </p>
<p>While this is not the case anymore, as there is some clarity on what powers SEC has, however, the biggest issue is that the US Senator and Mr Gensler want to kill the technology altogether as they want to nationalize the financial supply. </p>
<p>So, at the moment, the main challenge is not the laws but the people who are making those laws. Which is also a reason why the future is bleak. </p>

Both these initiatives guarantee that HTX continues to lead together with other exchanges while also ensuring it provides true secure services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as per Charmaine, HTX is also constantly looking toward other potential markets; however, as regulations are not clear in most parts of the world, it is difficult to work with the regulators and be certain. </p>

    <div class="text-grey-600  p4 md:p3 md:p3--ns"><p>On the question of how HTX is ensuring the security of users’ assets, Charmaine said the first thing is the development of our reserve, which acts as insurance in case things go sideways. Despite the fact that a breach has never happened before with HTX due to powerful and up-to-date security measures. </p>
<p>Having a reserve guarantees that if things somehow manage to go wrong, HTX will still have more funds to make sure that none of its customers suffer. Regardless, at the end of the day, this ensures peace of mind, which is very important to users. </p>
<p>For large volume traders of HTX who often decide to work with third-party custodial services, HTX has already integrated with fire blocks and is continuously working with partners alike to bring such services. </p>
<p>Also, HTX welcomes those who feel safer using third-party custodial services and want to integrate with HTX for trading, as we are happy to connect and meet the requirements.</p>

<p>As opposed to what many think, centralized exchanges, in general, should coexist with decentralized finance because when both grow together, the potential is immense. </p>
<p>Therefore, there should not be any competition between the two rather, customers should be given these two choices and they should choose the best for themselves based on what suits them the most. Doing so will allow both sectors to grow together and help bridge the gap that exists between traditional and decentralized finance. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the wake of the latest Bitcoin halving event, a significant shift in the cryptocurrency mining landscape is emerging, according to a recent report by CoinShares. </strong></p>



<p>As the halving reduces the rate of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/2024-bitcoin-halving-completed-what-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin supply growth by 50%</a>, miners are confronted with soaring operational costs, prompting some to consider alternative revenue streams such as artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-post-halving-spike-bitcoin-mining-costs-to-reach-53-000">Post-Halving Spike: Bitcoin Mining Costs to Reach $53,000</h2>



<p>The report highlights a nearly doubling of mining costs, projecting that the average cash cost of production will jump from $29,500 to approximately $53,000 per Bitcoin. Similarly, it expects electricity costs to rise from $16,300 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $34,900 per Bitcoin mined post-halving. These increased expenses are driving mining companies to explore more economically viable options.</p>



<p>Companies like BitDigital, Hive, and Hut 8 have already begun to generate income from AI technologies, leveraging their computational capabilities beyond cryptocurrency mining. CoinShares points out that TeraWulf and Core Scientific are not only active in the sector but are also planning to expand their AI operations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Companies like TeraWulf and Bitdeer are actively expanding their capacities. Core Scientific, for instance, is hosting Coreweave under a multi-year contract. At the same time, BitDigital plans to double its capacity, aiming to reach an estimated annual run rate of approximately $100 million.&#8221; The report <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/coinshares-mining-report-update-our-insights-at-the-2024-halving-382089820a07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">states</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miners-adapt-to-halving-new-focus-on-stranded-energy-and-ai-tech">Miners Adapt to Halving: New Focus on Stranded Energy and AI Tech</h2>



<p>James Butterfill, lead author of the CoinShares report, suggests that Bitcoin mining operations might gravitate towards locations with stranded energy resources. At the same time, investment in AI could proliferate in more stable environments. </p>



<p>This strategic shift could help mitigate the financial strain caused by the halving as miners seek to optimize energy costs, enhance mining efficiency, and invest in cost-effective hardware.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-miners-buy-more-machines-boost-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fluctuations in the hashrate</a>—the combined computational power used in mining and processing Bitcoin transactions—further complicate the mining landscape. Post-halving forecasts predict that the hashrate will eventually climb to 700 exahash by 2025, although an immediate 10% drop is expected as less profitable mining operations go offline.</p>



<p>Concurrently, we anticipate that hash prices, which reflect the earnings per unit of hashrate, will decline.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has reportedly raised $12 million to develop a new layer-3 blockchain. The team secured this fund through the sale of its upcoming token, TREAT, to non-US venture capital firms. </strong></p>



<p>Notably, investors included Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands, among others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-plans-to-build-a-layer-3-blockchain-on-top-of-shibarium">Shiba Inu Plans to Build a Layer-3 Blockchain on Top of Shibarium</h2>



<p>Initiated a few months back, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/pacquiao-foundation-onboards-shibarium-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fundraising concluded</a> earlier this month. According to reports, the team executed fundraising in tranches, reaching valuations of $75 million, $100 million, and $200 million.</p>



<p>The TREAT token will serve as both the utility and governance token of Shiba Inu&#8217;s forthcoming layer-3 blockchain. This new platform is being constructed on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-tvl-increases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top of Shibarium</a>, the project&#8217;s <a href="https://beincrypto.com/vaneck-predict-1trillion-ethereum-layer-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum layer-2</a> blockchain. </p>



<p>Readers should note that the Shiba Inu team has not yet launched the TREAT token. Any other token circulating with the same ticker, are fake.</p>



<p>Highlighting a commitment to privacy, the blockchain integrates fully homomorphic encryption technology from cryptography firm Zama.</p>

<p>The raised funds will be channeled into the development of the layer-3 blockchain. This blockchain is expected to enhance the capabilities of the Shiba Inu ecosystem significantly. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;This new encryption chain aims to address multiple issues in crypto, including privacy and trust for Shiba Inu&#8217;s extensive community of tens of millions and the next billion crypto-curious individuals,&#8221; Shiba Inu <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/290068/shiba-inu-funding-treat-token-new-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking ahead, Shiba Inu plans to expand its ecosystem with the introduction of a new token, Shi. The team has scheduled its release later this year. </p>



<p>Moreover, the launch of the new <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-layer-3-fastest-tps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layer-3 blockchain</a> testnet has been scheduled for the third quarter of this year. A mainnet release will follow after thorough testing. </p>



<p>Currently, the ecosystem includes SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens. Each token serves a unique function within the network, with LEASH providing special benefits to Shiba Inu&#8217;s most dedicated supporters.

<p><strong>In a recent exposé, blockchain investigator ZachXBT unveiled that 12 Solana-based meme coin projects have been abandoned, leading to a staggering $26.7 million loss for investors. </strong></p>



<p>These meme coins were initially promoted through presales, promising substantial returns. However, they soon left their backers with tokens that became nearly worthless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-crypto-founders-stole-26-7-million-through-presales">How Crypto Founders Stole $26.7 Million Through Presales</h2>



<p>The most notorious of these projects was &#8220;I like this coin,&#8221; with the ticker symbol – LIKE. It attracted approximately $7.8 million in Solana (SOL) from investors. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/FuemMjepntbzthvSEVmDGnfq7YWr8UebZrAXJrP46VtF?t=1713770849823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a> from DEXTools, the coin&#8217;s value plummeted by over 50% since the launch. Moreover, there has been minimum communication from the creators.</p>



<p>Similarly, the MOONKE token faced a catastrophic decline. It <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/8xjo894p1FvCKhZ8QtuRN745MCsfkazRJrxucTFsCrqL?t=1713771182560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crashed</a> by more than 80% soon after its release. These cases illustrate the risky nature of investing in hyped crypto ventures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a study by cybersecurity firm Blockaid revealed that at least 50% of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-presale-tokens-malicious-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presale tokens on the Solana blockchain from November 2023 to February 2024 were malicious</a>. Blockaid&#8217;s co-founder, Ido Ben-Natan, attributed this surge in fraudulent activities to the increased popularity of presale tokens. </p>



<p>Scammers have exploited <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-warns-fomo-bitcoin-etf-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investor FOMO (fear of missing out)</a> by mimicking legitimate transactions and creating sophisticated fake websites.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Firstly, the exponential increase in pre-sale token uptake in February and March, fueled by the popularity of legitimate meme coins, has provided fertile ground for scammers,” Ben-Natan explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Individuals known as Jared_eth and Bluekirbyftm have been identified as some of the culprits behind these operations.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Solana blockchain has seen the rise of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/racist-memecoins-condemnation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coins with offensive and racist themes</a>, which has led to severe backlash from the crypto community. These developments have intensified calls for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/indonesia-strict-crypto-regulation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stricter regulations</a> and enhanced security protocols to safeguard investors from these increasingly complex scams.</p>

<p>Investors should exercise increased caution and due diligence. It is crucial to look for projects with transparent, accountable leadership and verifiable support. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, the need for robust protective measures and informed investment strategies becomes more apparent. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Chainlink&#8217;s (LINK) price felt the bullishness of the Bitcoin halving event more than BTC itself, which was visible in its 20% rally.</strong></p>



<p>The altcoin, however, is now facing a crucial barrier, which has been a challenge in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chainlink-investors-might-move-to-sell">Chainlink Investors Might Move to Sell</h2>



<p>As Chainlink&#8217;s price rose, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LINK investors regained their profits</a>, which might be a key factor driving them to sell. The recent correction brought the total LINK supply in profit down from 84% to 70%.</p>



<p>This 14% supply represents nearly 82.18 million LINK worth nearly $1.3 billion. All of this supply has once again returned to its original state before the decline. In the past two days, the profitable supply rose by 13% to reach 84% at the time of writing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-850x288.png" alt="Chainlink Supply in Profit. " class="wp-image-503198" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ChainLink-on-Ethereum-LINK-11.26.14-22-Apr-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chainlink Supply in Profit. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is a good thing, it is also a potential trigger for selling, as investors want to secure their gains to prevent losses from another decline. This would drive Chainlink&#8217;s price lower.</p>

<p>The Market Value substantiates this sentiment to the Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio tracks investor gains/losses. Chainlink&#8217;s 7-day MVRV of 11% suggests profit, possibly prompting sales. Historically, LINK corrects at MVRV levels of 8% to 15%, labeling it a danger zone.</p>

<p>In the short-term timeframe, this area has repeatedly witnessed declines, which is the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-etf-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected outcome for LINK</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-link-price-prediction-beating-the-barrier">LINK Price Prediction: Beating the Barrier</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/link-primed-for-recovery-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price was noted to rally by 20% over the weekend</a>, bringing the digital asset to trade at $15.8. Right under this point is a barrier that LINK has attempted to sustain multiple times and failed in the past.</p>



<p>Even though The altcoin manages to close above it, it falls back down from the $15.6 resistance to test the support at $14.6 and $13.4. If LINK holders move to sell this time, the potential decline will result in a test of the latter support level should the former break.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="380" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pjR7DehD-850x380.png" alt="LINK/USDT 12-hour chart.

<p>However, if the resistance of $15.6 is successfully breached and flipped into support, recovery is possible.</p>

<p>The next critical resistance lies at $18, and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/link-price-breach-bearish-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink&#8217;s price would make it there should it breach $17</a>. Once the latter is flipped into support, the altcoin would invalidate the bearish thesis and rally towards $18.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the dynamic crypto ecosystem, meme coins seem to dodge the regulatory hurdles that impede more substantive cryptos. While tokens like Dogecoin, born from humor, thrive, entrepreneurs eager to launch utilitarian cryptos face daunting challenges. </strong></p>



<p>This imbalance raises critical questions about US crypto regulations and their impact on innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andreessen-horowitz-general-partner-criticizes-us-crypto-regulations">Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Criticizes US Crypto Regulations</h2>



<p>Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz leading their crypto fund, has <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/memecoins-tokens-regulation-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">criticized</a> the existing regulatory practices. He points out that these regulations facilitate the proliferation of meme coins at the expense of more innovative, blockchain-based solutions. </p>



<p>According to Dixon, the US crypto regulation unintentionally encourages launching <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coins</a> because they lack practical utility, thus evading the stringent scrutiny applied to potentially transformative technologies.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;It’s actually safer to release a meme coin today with no use case than it is to launch a token that’s useful. Think about it this way: We’d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivized only GameStop meme stocks but that rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA — all companies with products people use daily,&#8221; Dixon wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?</a></strong></p>



<p>This regulatory paradox is clear in the relative ease of creating and launching meme coins. This is because meme coins often do not require a team of developers or a legitimate business plan. They thrive on community engagement and internet culture, often gaining value from sheer speculation rather than underlying utility.</p>



<p>Conversely, developers aiming to introduce blockchain tokens with practical applications encounter a maze of compliance issues. These tokens could revolutionize payment systems, digital authenticity, and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/a16z-decentralized-governance-machiavellian-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized governance</a> but often find themselves mired in what Dixon describes as &#8220;regulatory purgatory.&#8221; </p>



<p>Additionally, recent initiatives by <a href="https://beincrypto.com/a16z-new-funds-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andreessen Horowitz, such as its massive $7.2 billion fundraising</a> aimed at sectors like infrastructure and gaming, demonstrate a firm commitment to the potential of these technologies to drive future growth. This is supported by its active role in advocating for regulatory reforms that could level the playing field for serious crypto projects versus meme coins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-s-approach-to-crypto-hinders-innovation">SEC&#8217;s Approach to Crypto Hinders Innovation</h2>



<p>The primary challenge stems from the application of the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nba-top-shot-nfts-howey-test-securities-us-judge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Howey test by the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC). Established in 1946, this test determines if a crypto qualifies as a security. Its broad interpretation in the context of modern digital assets has been a point of contention.</p>



<p>Despite their decentralized nature, only a few projects like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereumized-good-bad-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a> have been recognized by the SEC as not involving managerial efforts, exempting them from certain regulatory requirements. The lack of clear guidelines has led to what many in the crypto sector describe as &#8220;<a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-chairman-crypto-enforcements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulation by enforcement</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The call for clearer regulations isn&#8217;t isolated to Dixon&#8217;s observations. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-leaders-support-uniswap-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leaders across the crypto sector have voiced</a> similar concerns. </p>



<p>For instance, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Haun Ventures CEO Kathryn Haun have publicly criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach, particularly its recent <a href="https://beincrypto.com/will-sec-sue-uniswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actions against platforms like Uniswap</a>. They argue that the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; creates uncertainty that stifles innovation and equity within the industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>FTX's bankruptcy estate shifts to auctioning Solana tokens, potentially altering market dynamics and fostering competitive bidding, as Solana tests key price levels.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy estate is preparing for a pivotal move by auctioning a significant batch of Solana (SOL) tokens. This strategy forms part of FTX&#8217;s liquidation process initiated after its collapse in November 2022. </strong></p>



<p>The upcoming auction, which diverges from previous fixed-price sales, is a strategic shift signaling potential changes in market dynamics. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-crypto-community-participate-in-the-solana-auction">Will the Crypto Community Participate in the Solana Auction?</h2>



<p>Previously, between <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftx-sold-30-million-solana-sol-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25 million and 30 million SOL tokens were sold</a>, netting nearly $1.9 billion. These were priced at $64 each, a sharp 60% discount from the market price then. However, the discount came with a trade-off, i.e., the buyers had to lock their SOL for four years.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Basically you’re exchanging time for a discount — you have to lock up your capital for four years, but you get to pay much less for the tokens,” Eva Weng, from Caladan, said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/auctions-drive-nft-growth-abridged-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opt for an auction</a> this time around could foster competitive bidding, possibly influencing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sol-price-upswing-on-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana&#8217;s market price</a>. Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Markets, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcagney/status/1781804464028139848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the auction, but the final details are still under wraps. </p>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Buy Solana (SOL) and Everything You Need To Know</a></strong></p>



<p>Cagney&#8217;s Figure Markets is developing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate the crypto community&#8217;s participation in the auction. This mechanism is designed to attract both non-US and accredited US investors. It allows them to engage in community consensus to decide on bid prices and manage subsequent investments. </p>



<p>The auction format might escalate bidding fervor, with a probability of implications on Solana’s pricing trends.</p>



<p>Currently, Solana&#8217;s price trajectory is on a possible upturn. After reaching a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/why-solana-broke-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high of $210 on March 18, the Solana price</a> dropped significantly by over 44%, hitting a low of around $116 on April 13. Nevertheless, it has rebounded, trading nearly 30% higher from that low. </p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-dexs-volume-resurgen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This recovery is crucial</a> as Solana tests major resistance levels near $156. This level is significant, marking a key Fibonacci retracement point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="493" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-850x493.png" alt="Solana (SOL) Price Performance" class="wp-image-503173" style="aspect-ratio:1.7241379310344827;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-850x493.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-360x209.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-768x445.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-1536x891.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-2048x1188.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-22_10-10-24-150x87.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Solana (SOL) Price Performance.

<p>If Solana manages to maintain a position above $156, it could see a rise of 22% to approximately $185, tapping into the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Conversely, if it fails to overcome this barrier, the price might find support at $145.56.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin's blockchain transformation with Runes has spiked transaction fees to historic levels, boosting miner revenues and highlighting a significant shift in the network's economic dynamics amid underestimations by traditional finance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain is undergoing a historic transformation, spearheaded by the introduction of the Runes token standard. </strong></p>



<p>This new development enhances the functionality of Bitcoin by enabling the creation of fungible tokens. It also significantly boosts transaction fees and miner revenue, reshaping the economic landscape of the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altcoins-on-bitcoin-mark-a-new-milestone">Altcoins on Bitcoin Mark a New Milestone</h2>



<p>Lucas Outumuro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, recently <a href="https://x.com/LucasOutumuro/status/1782089893327388711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> the seismic impact of Runes, describing it as &#8220;absolutely insane.&#8221; He pointed to the surge in daily fees which reached a record $80 million. This is about four times higher than the previous all-time high set in December 2017.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the average <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-protocol-runes-clogs-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin transaction fee has skyrocketed</a> to $128, a figure that starkly overshadows the $30 peak during the initial frenzy over Ordinals. </p>



<p>This surge in fees has been a boon for miners, who despite a 50% drop in inflationary rewards due to the halving, saw their earnings spike by 1,200% following <a href="https://beincrypto.com/new-protocol-altcoin-creation-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Runes launch</a>. The sudden spike lead to a record <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-miners-revenue-rune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 million in Bitcoin mining revenue</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="567" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-850x567.png" alt="Bitcoin Transaction Fees" class="wp-image-503157" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-850x567.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-360x240.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-768x512.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z-150x100.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ITB_btc_miner_rewards_undefined_2024-04-21T18_40_24.151Z.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Transaction Fees.

<p>Still, the introduction of Runes coincided with a significant downturn in new Bitcoin addresses, which have hit a two-year low. According to Outumuro, this indicates that the current surge is driven predominantly by seasoned crypto enthusiasts, with retail investors yet to join the fray.</p>



<p>The traditional finance sector, particularly Wall Street, was caught off guard by these developments. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/marathon-digital-mine-btc-monthly-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stocks like Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA)</a> and Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw over a 20% decline in the month leading up to the halving, underestimating the potential of Runes and the adaptability of the crypto market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>In the cryptocurrency market, the latest halving event has surprisingly not put Bitcoin in the spotlight. Instead, meme coins, particularly those with canine themes, have surged dramatically over the weekend. </strong></p>



<p>Following the halving late Friday, which reduced miner rewards by 50%, Bitcoin has seen modest gains. However, meme coins like BONK and FLOKI have experienced remarkable price increases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meme-coins-on-the-rise">Meme Coins on the Rise</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-solana-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana-based meme coin</a> BONK led the rally with an impressive 46% increase, reaching a price of $0.000022. This marks a significant recovery for BONK, which saw a substantial drop earlier in April. </p>



<p>Other notable performers include Ethereum-based FLOKI, which soared nearly 26% to $0.00018, and Shiba Inu (SHIB), climbing 24% to over $0.000028.</p>

<p>These gains contrast with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-bear-market-before-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin’s relatively stable post-halving</a> performance, which has seen only a 1.5% increase to just below $65,000. This subdued movement follows a record high of $73,805 set in March, driven by the anticipation and launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). </p>



<p>Historically, Bitcoin’s most substantial gains have materialized months after halving events, suggesting potential future growth.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The 2024 halving will showcase Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience and the market&#8217;s maturity, with less volatility observed due to institutional involvement and the ETF introduction. Predictions for the next halving include a potential for less pronounced short-term price fluctuations, but a significant long-term price appreciation, likely surpassing all-time highs,&#8221; Hao Yang, Head of Financial Products at Bybit, told BeInCrypto. </p>
