<li>Injective and Web3 mobile firm Jambo will partner to promote DeFi in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.</li>
<li>The collaboration seeks to make it easy for millions to access dApps via the Jambophone.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/injective/">Injective</a> and Web3 mobile infrastructure platform Jambo have announced a partnership that will see the two companies collaborate to bring blockchain-powered financial solutions to millions of users in emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The partnership will tap into JamboPhone, a Web3 Android 13 smartphone, to introduce users across Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia to Injective&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>&ldquo;Combining Injective&rsquo;s robust infrastructure stack with Jambo&rsquo;s mature Web3 mobile technology will enable us to efficiently scale DeFi to the point where it can tangibly help billions of people overcome socioeconomic hurdles,</em>&rdquo; Mirza Uddin, head of business at Injective Labs said in an <a href="https://blog.injective.com/en/injective-and-jambo-bring-mobile-based-defi-to-millions-in-emerging-markets/">announcement</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As part of the collaboration, users in these emerging markets will access multiple decentralised applications (dApps) in the Injective ecosystem via JamboPlay dApp store. One of the first platforms to be available will be Ninji, a native Injective wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;We want to bring emerging markets on-chain,&rdquo; James Zhang, co-founder of Jambo, noted.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Web3 phone for DeFi adoption</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">JamboPhone is currently priced at $99 and has been sold in more than 100 countries. The Web3 phone features preloaded applications that include DeFi, gaming, and Web3 infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The partnership continues Jambo&rsquo;s commitment to promoting the crypto adoption space in Africa and other emerging markets. It&rsquo;s also part of Injective&rsquo;s mission, with the blockchain platform offering an interoperable layer 1 network optimised for Web3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Injective, incubated by Binance, counts Pantera, Jump Crypto and Mark Cuban among its backers. The native token INJ is currently the 45</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following today&rsquo;s partnership announcement, INJ price has surged more than 12% in 24 hours to reach highs of $28.47.</span></p>

<li>Solana&rsquo;s price has plunged 21.8% in the last seven days despite fixing its recent network congestion issues.</li>
<li>The Shiba Inu community has burnt over 774 million tokens in the past week.</li>
<li>NuggetRush&rsquo;s crypto mining game integrates NFTs with blockchain gaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite a 21.8% price drop over the last week, investors remain hopeful that the new update will resolve network congestion on the Solana network. The update is expected to bring a positive turnaround in the market for SOL.</p>
<p>At the same time, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/what-is-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu</a> community has burned over 774 million tokens in just one week. <a href="https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=cjl&amp;utm_content=78">NuggetRush</a>, meanwhile, has integrated some of the best NFTs into their new crypto mining game. The target is to offer its users a real-world gaming experience.</p>
<h2>NuggetRush (NUGX) raises excitement in the gaming space with NFTs</h2>
<p><a href="https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=cjl&amp;utm_content=78">NuggetRush (NUGX)</a> is building a platform where players can assemble the best mining team to explore and mine precious minerals like gold, silver, and diamond. The platform has trending NFTs, which have different users on its gaming platform.</p>
<p>Firstly, these NFTs serve as the characters of players and give them unique abilities. These unique abilities &ndash; speed, mining knowledge, and lots more add fun to the game, making it interesting. In addition to the NFTs acting as characters, there are some rare NFTs called RUSHGEMs.</p>
<p>Fans have described them as the coolest NFTs, as they can be exchanged for real gold, making them one of the most searched NFTs in the game. Lastly, NFTs can be staked to receive a passive income of up to 20% APY. The amount earned as passive income will depend on the amount of stake and the duration of the stake.</p>
<p>Whichever is the case, NuggetRush&rsquo;s NFTs are being hailed by some as the best NFTs to invest in. The NuggetRush airdrop for its NUGX token is less than a week from now, and investors are excited. The NUGX token, which will be listed at $0.020, could rise 50x after its listing this quarter, according to some chartists.</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL) price drops to lows at $120</h2>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/">Solana (SOL) price</a> has been on a steep decline in the past week, dropping 21.8% to $124.69. The &ldquo;Ethereum killer&rdquo; was greatly affected by the latest bear market and issues of failed transactions on its network. Meanwhile, Anza, the development team behind Solana, has launched a new update, v1.17.31, to solve the issue of network congestion.</p>
<p>While this is not a major fix, the team said it would release other updates to complete the issue. With this update, we should see positive momentum returning to the Solana ecosystem in the coming days. If this happens, bulls could take SOL to the long-awaited $250 mark.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB) community burns 774M SHIB</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a rapid increase in its token burn rates. Data from Shibburn shows that over 774 million SHIB tokens were burnt in the last week. This is an increase of nearly 200%. Despite this uptick in burn rates, the circulating supply of the meme coin still stands at 582.80 trillion SHIB.</p>
<p>Additionally, Shiba Inu, like many other top altcoins, is still trading in losses. The coin&rsquo;s price has gone down 24.0% in the past week. Its price could increase in the coming days if positive momentum returns to the market.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Solana investors are expecting the new update to bring a positive wave to the SOL token. On the other hand, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s massive token burn did not affect its price.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NuggetRush&rsquo;s introduction of NFTs to its game makes its native token one of the best altcoins to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, April 18th, 2024, Chainwire</strong></p>
<h2>The annual event is a culmination of Sui&rsquo;s exceptional debut</h2>
<p>Over 1,000 projects, partners, investors, and enthusiasts from 65 countries around the world gathered last week in Paris to celebrate <a href="https://sui.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sui</a> at the vaunted Layer 1&rsquo;s inaugural global Sui Basecamp conference.</p>
<p>At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats.</p>
<p>The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world&rsquo;s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services.</p>
<h6><img decoding="async" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image3_1713441290AoB5zziFvA.jpg">Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face.</h6>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,&rdquo; said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. &ldquo;Less than a year after launching Sui&rsquo;s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui&rsquo;s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui&rsquo;s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry &mdash; the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets.</p>
<p>Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui&rsquo;s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui&rsquo;s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators.</p>
<p>And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime.</p>
<p>Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui&rsquo;s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui&rsquo;s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui&rsquo;s potential to make people&rsquo;s lives better,&rdquo; said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. &ldquo;In the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui&rsquo;s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SUI plunges 33% in a week, but experts believe bulls will take over soon.</li>
<li>BONK slumps 32% in a week, but analysts foresee a resurgence by month&rsquo;s end.</li>
<li>Rebel Satoshi&rsquo;s $RECQ attracts more investors after surging 85% during its presale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top crypto coins like Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) have recorded double-digit losses over the second week of April as the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cryptocurrency/">crypto market</a> continues bleeding.</p>
<p>As a result, a growing number of investors are migrating to <a href="https://recq.rebelsatoshi.com/?utm_source=4793&amp;utm_medium=News&amp;utm_id=Fox">Rebel Satoshi&rsquo;s</a> $RECQ token, which has surged 85% so far during its ongoing public presale.</p>
<p>Why is $RECQ outpacing popular cryptos like SUI and BONK? Continue reading to find out.</p>
<h2>SUI plummets 33% in a week: will bulls resurface soon?</h2>
<p>SUI has performed deplorably over the past seven days. On April 7, SUI was changing hands at around $1.65. After a day of range-bound trading, the token rose slightly on April 8 following the <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1777369064303657318">announcement</a> of Suilend completing its beta phase, becoming publicly available. Notably, Suilend hit a $30 million TVL during its beta phase, which started on March 11.</p>
<p>This news saw SUI jump to as high as $1.72 on April 9. However, the excitement about this news cooled off, and the price began correcting downward. By April 14, the token had stabilized at around $1.10.</p>
<p>This price means SUI has shed 33.33% in a week and the subpar performance explains why many investors are abandoning the token.</p>
<p>Still, some experts believe SUI will overcome the current bearish trend and climb to $1.91 by the end of April. This forecast could make SUI a good crypto to buy now. Experts base this prediction on SUI gaining more adoption as more Web3 gamers line up to purchase the SuiPlay0X1 handheld gaming device, which SUI introduced on April 10.</p>
<h2>BONK wipes off 32% in a week: will bears persist?</h2>
<p>BONK has performed abysmally over the past seven days. On April 7, BONK was hovering around $0.00002317. After a day of sideways trading, BONK gained traction on April 8 after AllDomains announced the number of registered .LetsBONK domain names had exceeded 10,000.</p>
<p>This milestone saw BONK jump as high as $0.00002452 on April 8. BONK held this level for a day before the excitement about AllDomain news faded. Consequently, BONK began retracing its growth. By April 14, BONK had leveled off at around $0.00001561. This price means SUI has plunged 32.63% in a week.</p>
<p>This lackluster performance has left investors asking, is BONK a top crypto to invest in? According to some experts, BONK could reverse course and jump to $0.00001800 by the end of April. Experts base this prediction on BONK gaining more adoption after the BONK team announced that BONK adopters had locked over 3 trillion BONK on ArmadaFi as of April 12.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rebelsatoshi.com/?utm_source=MCAP&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_id=Bird"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198347" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Market-cap.png" alt="" width="587" height="73"></a></p>
<h2>Rebel Satoshi&rsquo;s $RECQ steals the show after jumping 85%</h2>
<p>Rebel Satoshi, an upcoming meme coin project, has emerged as the latest sensation in the crypto industry due to its mission to fight centralization. Investors are buzzing about Rebel Satoshi because its mission entails uniting the silent majority and building a vibrant community that champions decentralization.</p>
<p>A number of analysts have suggested Rebel Satoshi might be the best ICO to invest in right now because it boasts two tokens, namely $RBLZ and $RECQ. $RBLZ is <a href="https://recq.rebelsatoshi.com/?utm_source=4793&amp;utm_medium=News&amp;utm_id=Fox">Rebel SatoshI&rsquo;s</a> governance and membership token, while $RECQ is its base currency. Interestingly, $RBLZ rewarded Early Bird Round investors of its presale with a 150% ROI.</p>
<p>As of April, $RBLZ was available on Coinstore, CoinGecko, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/uniswap/what-is-uniswap/">Uniswap</a>, and DEXTools. On the other hand, $RECQ had kickstarted Stage 1 of its ongoing public presale. During this round, investors can purchase $RECQ at $0.0037. This price denotes an 85% surge from the Early Bird Round $RECQ price of $0.0020.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that Rebel Satoshi has set $RECQ&rsquo;s launch price at $0.0125. When $RECQ attains this price, Early Bird Round investors will get a 525% ROI, while Stage 1 investors will enjoy an ROI of 237.84%.</p>
<p>For the latest updates and more information on $RECQ, visit the official <a href="https://www.rebelsatoshi.com/">Rebel Satoshi Website</a> or contact Rebel Red via <a href="https://t.me/RBLZRED">Telegram</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Victoria, Seychelles, April 18th, 2024, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitget&rsquo;s</a> Chief Operating Officer, Vugar Usi Zade, shared the stage during the recent <a href="https://blockchain-life.com/asia/en/?spring2024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Blockchain Life Week 2024</a>, with other distinguished leaders from top crypto exchanges in a <a href="https://twitter.com/usithetalk/status/1779973977080770608" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">panel</a> titled &ldquo;Conductors in the World of Cryptocurrencies: What Top Exchanges Think About 2024&rdquo;. The discussion provided an in-depth look at the anticipated developments and strategic directions for the crypto industry in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Vugar Usi Zade highlighted the critical importance of prioritizing end-user experiences and privacy, drawing lessons from historical challenges such as the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data scandal. He stressed the necessity for industry leaders to work closely with regulators to enhance user protection without stifling innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our goal is to ensure that legislation supports the growth of blockchain technologies rather than hindering it,&rdquo; Usi Zade noted. &ldquo;As key players, centralized exchanges should work with legislators and educate them on how blockchain technology works and how introducing legislation should help the end user.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Addressing the infrastructure of the gig economy and energy sectors, Usi Zade shared insights about Bitget&rsquo;s initiatives to support the integration of blockchain technologies in various industries. &ldquo;We are particularly excited about our projects that give NFTs a second chance and promote sustainable energy practices among communities,&rdquo; he added.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A significant focus for Bitget in the coming years, as outlined by Usi Zade, will be on developing and nurturing talent within the blockchain sector. He emphasized the company&rsquo;s commitment to invest in entrepreneurial innovation on its platform. &ldquo;We believe in empowering new talent to build and develop rather than trying to do everything ourselves,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;There are so many opportunities, and we need so much talent, for the entire economy and industry. In the next two years, we will invest as many resources as possible to develop talent.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>With an exemplary track record of safety, Bitget underscores its pledge to user security through substantial financial safeguards, including a robust protection fund. &ldquo;We maintain a 200% <a href="https://www.bitget.com/proof-of-reserves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof of reserve</a>, ensuring that funds remain secure even if all users withdraw their assets simultaneously.&rdquo; Usi Zade asserted. &ldquo;We have security measures in place, but in case something goes wrong, we have an insured Protection Fund to make sure that there are no customers suffering at the other end.&rdquo; The Bitget COO emphasized that its Protection Fund is one of the largest in the industry, providing an additional layer of security against potential breaches.</p></blockquote>
<h1><strong><img decoding="async" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BuivzSy73mQi1jetm55ZsabSK7OR0lCaDbta8bDucXdp3pIUi4_1713438832bt5PKLfy9B.jpeg"></strong></h1>
<p>Usi Zade also discussed the role of centralized exchanges in facilitating access to the crypto market. He described how Bitget has simplified the transition for users from traditional finance to cryptocurrencies through user-friendly services like social logins and comprehensive customer support.</p>
<blockquote><p>The COO concluded his talk by touching upon the regulatory challenges and the potential of decentralized exchanges to evolve further. &ldquo;As legislation in Europe begins to affect how users can transact with non-KYC wallets, centralized exchanges will need to adapt. However, this also presents an opportunity to redefine our roles, potentially acting as intermediaries in large B2B transactions,&rdquo; he speculated.</p></blockquote>
<p>The panel discussion at Blockchain Life Week 2024 provided much-needed insights into the crypto industry&rsquo;s expected trajectory. It also reinforced Bitget&rsquo;s position as a leader prepared to navigate and shape the future landscape of digital currencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://spacecatch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceCatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a brand new AR M2E (Move-to-Earn) game, has confirmed the release date for its public beta version. The game, which will come packed with impressive features and multiple benefits after an extensive development period, is scheduled for release on April 22 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set in a futuristic world similar to our own, where Earth has been overtaken by AI-driven aliens, SpaceCatch challenges players, known as Catchers, to restore peace on Earth by defeating these aliens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game offers a captivating narrative that engages players, making it difficult to put their phones down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scheduled for release on April 22, SpaceCatch is inviting players to reserve their spot early, with only 22,000 entries available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being pre-launch, SpaceCatch has already won over early adopters thanks to its rich feature set and engaging plot. The growing community and successful fundraising efforts are living proof of its appeal and potential.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how does it work?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://spacecatch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceCatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leverages several cutting-edge technologies to deliver its exciting gameplay. The game operates on two models: M2E (Move to Earn) and P2E (Play to Earn). The P2E model is straightforward: players engage in combat with AI-driven aliens to restore peace on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The M2E model, on the other hand, is powered by Augmented Reality (AR). This integration allows players to interact with the SpaceCatch universe as it blends seamlessly with the real world. Imagine spotting an alien while in the park, relaxing in your living room, or getting in your car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, SpaceCatch employs artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a unique gaming experience for each player. Your game experience will differ from that of others, molded by your decisions, preferences, and behavior.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than just a game</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://spacecatch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceCatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also developed a native token, CATCH, which is valuable both within and outside the game&rsquo;s ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CATCH has been distributed to users during various fundraising events, CATCH can be earned through specific actions in the game and is available for purchase on multiple exchanges, including Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC, BitMart, XT.com, and Bingx.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you were not around when SpaceCatch organized the fundraising rounds, or you prefer not to perform certain actions in the game to earn CATCH, don&rsquo;t worry; you can still get some tokens. CATCH can be bought, sold, or traded on various platforms, and this will help several new players get a better start in the SpaceCatch world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CATCH helps SpaceCatch players improve their characters and tools, and this can highly contribute to their evolution in the game and how much they manage to help with their main common goal: restoring peace on Earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discover More</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceCatch is just getting started in the industry, and has big plans up its sleeve. But with just 22,000 beta entries up for grabs, gamers should check out its </span><a href="https://spacecatch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asap and follow its activity on </span><a href="https://t.me/spacecatch_io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://discord.gg/spacecatchers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/spacecatch_io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X (Twitter)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spacecatch_io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://instagram.com/spacecatch_io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@spacecatch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/spacecatch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinMarketCap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
