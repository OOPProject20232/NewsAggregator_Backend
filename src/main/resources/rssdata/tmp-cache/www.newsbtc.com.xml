The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $572 resistance zone. BNB Price Faces Hurdles After a downside correction below $550, BNB price found support near the $515 zone. A low was formed at $513.6 and the price started a recovery wave, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move above the $525 and $530 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the $540 pivot level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $630 swing high to the $513 low.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin miners have always sold as Halvings have occurred. With the next one just around the corner, how are miners behaving this time? Next Bitcoin Halving Is Less Than Two Days Away Now In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed Bitcoin miners&#8217; behavior in the build-up to the next Halving. The &#8220;Halving&#8221; is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the cryptocurrency&#8217;s block rewards (the compensation miners receive for solving blocks) are permanently slashed in half. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Forms Bullish Pattern That Led To 50% Rally On Average This event occurs approximately every four years, and according to NiceHash&#8217;s countdown, the next one will occur in just over 32 hours. The countdown to the next halving event &#124; Source: NiceHash Bitcoin miners earn revenue from two sources: transaction fees and block rewards. Historically, the former has been quite low on the BTC network, so the miners primarily depend on the latter to pay off their running costs. Since the block rewards are cut in half during Halvings, these events naturally deal a significant blow to the miner&#8217;s revenues. As such, it&#8217;s not surprising that the miners have generally shown a reaction to the event in the past cycles. &#8220;One of the common dynamics that occur in every cycle of cutting the issuance of new BTC is the significant selling pressure exerted by miners,&#8221; says the quant. One way to gauge the degree of selling pressure coming from these chain validators is via the Miner to Exchange Flow metric. This indicator tracks the total amount of Bitcoin moving from miner-associated addresses to wallets connected to centralized exchanges. As miners usually deposit Bitcoin to these platforms for selling, this flow can provide hints about their selling behavior. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) BTC Miner to Exchange Flow over the last few years: Looks like the 30-day MA value of the metric has observed a steep plunge in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow had surged to high levels in the 2020 Halving event, implying that this group had potentially been participating in a selloff. This selling push may have come from the miners planning to exit, given the sharp revenue reduction that was set to occur. The graph, though, clearly shows that no such selling pressure has emerged this time around despite the event being just around the corner. Related Reading: 69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge So, what&#8217;s going on here? The analyst suggests that the Bitcoin miners may have already completed the latest round of selling in advance (as the exchange inflows from the cohort did spike in February). If this is true, the quant thinks this could benefit the market in the short term. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move sideways inside a range recently, as its price is still trading around $63,500. The price of the coin appears to have rebounded a bit from its latest drop &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from NisonCo PR and SEO on Unplash.com, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has been moving lower ahead of the Halving event, going against analysts&#8217; expectations. This price action has been unexpected and shows how the coin tends to go against predictions, basically charting its path.  Bitcoin Breaking The Mold In light of Bitcoin&#8217;s randomness, especially in the past few months following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one analyst expects the coin to continue defying expectations by clocking in a bull run that defies historical trends. The analyst cites two recent instances where Bitcoin defied expectations to justify this bullish outlook. First, following the rapid expansion in the 2020 to 2021 bull run that saw Bitcoin soar from less than $10,000 to fresh all-time highs of around $70,000, prices sharply contracted in 2022.  Related Reading: Bitcoin To $455,000: Expert Echoes Previous Halving Pattern Then, the United States Federal Reserve shifted its monetary policy to curb raging inflation by rapidly increasing interest rates. Following this and other market-related events, Bitcoin prices dipped below the all-time high of the previous cycle of $20,000. By November 2022, prices fell to as low as $15,000, accelerated by the collapse of FTX. This retest of previous highs and fall below $20,000 had never happened before.  Another anomaly occurred last month. For the first time, Bitcoin prices expanded and broke the previous all-time highs of around $70,000 before the Halving event. As Bitcoin&#8217;s past price action shows, prices only rally to fresh all-time highs after Halving. However, this changed when BTC soared to $73,800, possibly paving the way for bulls to join in and push the coin back to unchartered territory post-Halving.  Is BTC Ready For A Multi-Year Rally? With this in mind, the analyst believes Bitcoin will continue uniquely shaping its path, deviating from history. For instance, the analyst thinks BTC will outperform altcoins in the coming months. The analyst adds that increased regulatory scrutiny following high-profile collapses like FTX and Luna could dampen altcoin enthusiasm.  Related Reading: Here’s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 The coin will ride on the fact that it is the only one with an ETF from the United States SEC receiving investments. As a result of this capital injection, Bitcoin will likely register a multi-year &#8220;up only&#8221; phase, just like gold did once its ETF was approved. Prices remain depressed ahead of this. Though prices are increasing at spot rates, the coin is within a bear formation. Currently, BTC has local resistance at around $65,000.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that a Chainlink indicator is currently forming a pattern that has led to an average 50% increase for LINK in the past. Chainlink 30-Day MVRV Ratio Has Plunged In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the latest trend in Chainlink&#8217;s 30-day MVRV ratio. The &#8220;Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio&#8221; is a popular on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between LINK&#8217;s market cap and realized cap. The market cap naturally refers to the total valuation of the asset&#8217;s circulating supply at the current spot price. In contrast, the realized cap is a different type of capitalization model that calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by instead taking the price at which each coin in circulation last moved on the network as its &#8220;true&#8221; value. Related Reading: 69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge Since the last transaction of any coin was probably the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would signify its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of every coin in circulation. In this view, the realized cap would be nothing but a measure of the total capital the investors have used to purchase the asset. In contrast, the market cap represents the value that they are holding right now. The MVRV ratio compares these two models, and its value can provide hints about whether the overall market holds more or less than it puts into Chainlink. In the context of the current topic, the 30-day version of this indicator is of focus, which restricts itself to only the investors who bought within the past month. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this LINK indicator over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have registered a steep decline in recent days &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink 30-day MVRV ratio has recently taken a sharp plunge and dipped under the 0% mark. The 0% mark is where the market cap and realized cap are exactly equal, so below it, the latter would be greater than the former. When this is the case, the investors are carrying losses. This recent plunge into the negative has naturally come for the metric as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has plummeted, putting the 30-day buyers underwater. In the chart, Ali has highlighted a specific pattern that Chainlink appears to have followed regarding this indicator, plunging deep into the negative territory. &#8220;Each time Chainlink MVRV 30-Day Ratio has dropped below -12.24% since August 2022, it&#8217;s signaled a prime buying opportunity, averaging 50% returns!&#8221; notes the analyst.

					<description><![CDATA[Not only has Ethereum (ETH) seen an impressive rise of nearly 100% in the first quarter of 2024 in terms of price action, but the Ethereum blockchain has also generated substantial profits of up to $369 million during this period. This unexpected profitability has raised questions about how a blockchain like Ethereum can be profitable.  Ethereum Revenue Potential As noted in a recent analysis by the on-chain data platform Token Termina, the collection of transaction fees is a critical aspect of Ethereum&#8217;s business model.  All network users are required to pay fees in ETH when interacting with applications on the blockchain, which serves as an important source of revenue for Ethereum. Once transaction fees are paid, a portion of the ETH is burned and permanently removed from circulation. This process, commonly referred to as &#8220;ETH buyback,&#8221; benefits existing ETH holders, as the reduction in supply increases the scarcity and value of the remaining ETH tokens. Thus, the daily burning of ETH contributes to the economic benefit of those holding Ethereum. Related Reading: Here’s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 In contrast to the burning of ETH, Ethereum also issues new ETH tokens as rewards to the network&#8217;s validators for each new block added to the blockchain.  These rewards are similar to traditional stock-based compensation and are designed to incentivize validators to secure and maintain the network&#8217;s integrity.  Nonetheless, it&#8217;s important to note that the issuance of new ETH tokens dilutes the holdings of existing ETH holders. According to Token Terminal, the difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders, essentially the Ethereum blockchain owners. This calculation allows for the determination of Ethereum&#8217;s profitability on a day-to-day basis. Reduced Transaction Costs Drive $3.3 Billion Growth In addition to the overhauled revenue model implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, the launch of the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem at the end of the first quarter of 2024 brought significant changes, including the introduction of a revolutionary data storage system called blobs.  This upgrade has reduced congestion on the Ethereum network and significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum (ABR), Polygon (MATIC), and Coinbase&#8217;s Base.  Implementing the Dencun upgrade, alongside the adoption of blobs and Layer 2 networks, has significantly impacted Ethereum&#8217;s revenue.  According to Token Terminal data, the blockchain&#8217;s revenue has witnessed an 18% annualized increase, amounting to an impressive $3.3 billion. These revenue gains can be attributed to reduced transaction costs, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for users and developers. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $455,000: Expert Echoes Previous Halving Pattern Despite the positive revenue growth, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of market corrections and dampened investor interest in the second quarter of 2024.  Over the past 30 days, Ethereum&#8217;s revenue has declined by over 52%. This downturn can be attributed to the broader market dynamics and the temporary decrease in investor enthusiasm.  Examining the data over the past 30 days, Ethereum&#8217;s market cap (fully diluted) has decreased by 15.2% to $358.47 billion. Similarly, the circulating market cap has declined by 15.2% to reach the same value.  Additionally, the token trading volume over the past 30 days has declined 18.6%, totaling $586.14 billion.  ETH is trading at $3,042, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether these changes and the reduction in fees will have the same effect in the second quarter of the year, and how this, coupled with a potential increase in trading volume, can push the ETH price to higher levels.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amidst the ongoing fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, the price of Bitcoin has surged by 1.7% in the past 24 hours, hovering above the $62,000 mark. However, recent warnings from CryptoQuant, a leading crypto analytics platform, suggest that Bitcoin could face a significant downturn to $52,000 if specific key levels are violated. This cautionary note comes amidst growing uncertainty in the Bitcoin derivatives market, with derivative traders showing unprecedented caution compared to previous halving cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Hysteria: Will History Repeat Itself Or Are We Heading For A Market Meltdown? Bitcoin Risky Level CryptoQuant&#8217;s analysis highlights declining open interest and funding rates in the Bitcoin derivatives market, indicating a &#8220;cautious&#8221; stance among traders, particularly with the arrival of several institutional participants. CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley noted: At this halving, derivative traders exhibit far more caution than in previous instances. This season witnesses the entry of numerous new institutional players into the market. According to the analyst, If Bitcoin&#8217;s price falls below the critical $60,000 support level, the top cryptocurrency could experience a notable correction to $52,000, signaling a potential short-term bearish trend. Derivative Uncertainty “If the price breaks below $60,000, we might witness a decline to $52,000 before a subsequent rise.” – By @ShivenMoodley Full post 👇https://t.co/XSBnfexbzZ — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 18, 2024 However, the presence of institutional Bitcoin Spot ETFs may mitigate the severity of the decline by absorbing &#8220;excess supply from liquidations&#8221; around the $60,000 support zone. Moodley stated: If the price breaks below $60,000, we might witness a decline to $52,000 before a subsequent rise. However, given the significant dominance of institutional ETFs, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they accumulate excess supply from liquidations near the short-term support level of $60,000. Analysts Sound Alarm On BTC&#8217;s Fragile Position Meanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Ali has further fuelled concerns by identifying a pivotal price level for Bitcoin. Ali&#8217;s analysis indicates that if Bitcoin drops to $50,500, over $15 billion in liquidations could occur on the Binance alone. #Bitcoin dropping to $50,500 will trigger over $15 billion in liquidations on #Binance alone! pic.twitter.com/9wQTVwprgx — Ali (@ali_charts) April 17, 2024 Such a significant liquidation event could exert immense pressure on the market, potentially leading to further price declines and heightened volatility. This outlook echoes recent warnings from prominent analyst Crypto Rover, who has also cautioned about a potential liquidation event affecting short holders if Bitcoin climbs back to the crucial price mark of $71,600. Despite these concerns, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. Crypto analyst Plan B, known for his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, has made bullish predictions for Bitcoin&#8217;s future price movements.

<p>This outlook echoes recent warnings from prominent analyst Crypto Rover, who has also cautioned about a potential liquidation event affecting short holders if Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bears-beware-3-billion-short-liquidation-looms-at-this-price-mark-warns-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">climbs back to the crucial price mark of $71,600</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. Crypto analyst Plan B, known for his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, has <a href="https://x.com/100trillionUSD/status/1780586891735101653" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made bullish predictions</a> for Bitcoin&#8217;s future price movements.</p>

<p>According to Plan B, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-halving-hysteria-will-history-repeat-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin&#8217;s upcoming Halving event</a> will serve as a central driver for price increases, with the cryptocurrency expected to surpass $100,000 this year and exceed $300,000 by 2025.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Trend Rider has drawn Cardano (ADA) holders’ attention to the crypto token’s potential to experience a significant price rally soon enough. Based on Trend Rider’s analysis, Cardano could rise to as high as $3 when this happens.  Cardano To Rise To $3 If History Repeats Itself Trend Rider mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that if history repeats itself, Cardano might be on the brink of its “ultimate support test” before it makes a parabolic move to the upside. He further suggested that the crypto token could soar to $3, considering the same happened in October 2020 when Cardano’s price dipped to $0.10 and skyrocketed to $3 afterwards.   Related Reading: Crypto Exchanges Bitcoin Supply Can Only Last For 9 Months, ByBit Report The crypto analyst also revealed that Cardano was currently experiencing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover and retest, which could mean it was indeed gearing up for another parabolic move. This RSI crossover is an indicator that “perfectly predicts bull and bear markets for ADA.” Source: X Meanwhile, in an earlier X post, Trend Rider explained how crucial it was for Cardano to hold its current support level. According to him, ADA’s price is “right now at an extremely critical level, and if it fails to hold its current support zone, then it could fall quickly to $0.25.” However, if Cardano manages to hold above this support level, then this could be the “exact bottom right now” before it rises to $1, Trend Rider claimed.  Trend Rider further elaborated that Cardano’s next move will depend “entirely” on what Bitcoin does. He predicts that altcoins like Carano will experience a “monstrous bounce” if the flagship crypto rises above $65,000 after its current price dip. However, if Bitcoin’s price continues to dip, then it is “bear market mode,” Trend Rider added.  Cardano Won’t Be In The Red Forever  Crypto analyst Alan Santana has provided some form of optimism to ADA holders, stating that the crypto token won’t be red forever. He made this statement while acknowledging that Cardano has maintained a bearish outlook, having been in the red for seven weeks now. Despite that, he remains bullish on the crypto token’s future trajectory as he predicts that Cardano will experience a “big green” in the “latter part of 2024 and most of 2025.” Related Reading: Historical Trends Show What To Expect For Bitcoin Price Following The Halving Santana also noted that this was an excellent time to accumulate for those who intend to enjoy the “entire bullish wave.” For those looking to invest in ADA long-term, the crypto analyst highlighted the price range of $0.40 and $0.45 as a good “buy zone.” That is also the price area Santana had previously predicted Cardano could drop to in its bid to find support. At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at around $0.45, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  ADa price struggles to hold $0.45 &#124; Source: ADAUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from The Daily Hodl, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>
