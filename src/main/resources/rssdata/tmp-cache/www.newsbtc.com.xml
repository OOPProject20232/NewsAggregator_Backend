					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin miners have struck a proverbial goldmine, reaping an astonishing $107 million in profits, according to data from Glassnode, a leading analytics platform. This unprecedented windfall, amassed on April 20th, underscores a significant shift in the revenue dynamics of Bitcoin mining operations. Related Reading: Will Celestia (TIA) Hit $130? Analyst Makes Bold Prediction The meteoric rise in transaction fees serves as a bellwether for the evolving economic landscape of Bitcoin mining.

This trend is particularly noteworthy given the scheduled reductions in block rewards, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of Bitcoin&#8217;s economic model. According to glassnode, affected by the Runes minting activity, on April 20, Bitcoin miner revenue reached US$106.7 million, of which 75.444% came from network transaction fees, both reaching record highs. https://t.co/lVSyqn1UaE pic.twitter.com/xjkkTor2I9 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 21, 2024 Runes-Fueled Minting Spree Boosts Miner Revenue Driving this surge in profitability is a recent minting spree focused on Runes, a pivotal development that has left a tangible mark on the network&#8217;s dynamics.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent update, Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya (@kaaldhairya), confirmed that a temporary outage affecting the Shibarium network has been resolved. The outage, triggered by networking issues among validators, briefly disrupted services within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, specifically the layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium. Kaal detailed the cause and the subsequent resolution of the problem, stating, &#8220;There was a temporary Shibarium outage caused because of networking issues amongst the validators. Network is back up and running now.&#8221; He also noted that while the primary network functionality has been restored, some ancillary services such as Shibariumscan or external Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) may continue to face disruptions until additional remedial steps are completed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Jumps On Growing Support From 1.4 Million Holders Kaal emphasized the importance of collaboration among infrastructure teams to enhance communication and streamline operations. He urged external teams working on infrastructure-level elements such as RPC to coordinate closely with the Shibarium team. &#8220;If you’re an external team working on infrastructure level for Shibarium (e.g., RPC, etc.), please reach out so that we can streamline comms with you over shared telegram / slack channels,&#8221; he said. There was a temporary shibarium outage caused because of networking issues amongst the validators. Network is back up and running now, some services like shibariumscan or external RPCs can still remain down until the steps provided are implemented. If you’re an external team… &#8212; Kaal (@kaaldhairya) April 22, 2024 Shiba Inu Price Unfaced The recent price movements of Shiba Inu (SHIB) show no impact of the Shibarium outage. The four-hour chart for SHIB/USD illustrates a symmetrical triangle pattern that has governed the asset&#8217;s movement over the past several weeks. Contrary to a direct bullish sentiment, the price initially broke to the downside of the triangle on April 12, which typically signals a looming downtrend. However, in a swift change of fortunes, SHIB found substantial support at the 100-day EMA and is now testing the extended lower trendline of the once-confining triangle. At present, the price has surpassed the crucial resistance-turned-support level marked by the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002472. Notably, SHIB is also trading above all EMA’s in the 4-hour chart. The 200 EMA (blue line) is currently serving as crucial support after the first attempt to break above the extended trendline (black) failed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Insider Reveals Top 5 Shibarium Investment Rules A decisive and sustained break above this level could invalidate the prior bearish breakout, positioning SHIB for a potential bullish move to the north. However, volume activity on the chart indicates a tempered trading environment, lacking the aggressive spikes typically associated with decisive breakouts. This could suggest that the market is in a state of contemplation, with traders awaiting further confirmation before committing to a clear directional bias. Lastly, the RSI sits at a reading of 67, which is just shy of the overbought threshold. This placement implies that there is room for upward movement before the market becomes overextended. If SHIB battles above the extended lower trendline, the case for an imminent surge grows stronger, potentially leading to a rally towards the Fibonacci levels of 0.382 ($0.00002867), 0.5 ($0.00003203) and 0.618 ($0.00003527).

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin is attempting a recovery wave above the $0.150 resistance zone against the US Dollar. DOGE could struggle to clear the $0.170 resistance zone. DOGE started a recovery wave from the $0.1280 support zone against the US dollar. The price is trading above the $0.1500 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.170 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge. Dogecoin Price Faces Hurdles After a major decline, Dogecoin price found support at $0.1280. A low was formed at $0.1283 and DOGE started a decent recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.1350 and $0.140 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.2093 swing high to the $0.1283 low. However, the bears are still active and protecting more gains. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin is also below the $0.1650 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.1690 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.2093 swing high to the $0.1283 low. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $0.170 level. A close above the $0.170 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1880 resistance. The next major resistance is near $0.200. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.220 level. Another Decline in DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.170 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1525 level. The next major support is near the $0.1475 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.1750 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1280 level. Technical Indicators 4 Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. 4 Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1525, $0.1475 and $0.1280. Major Resistance Levels – $0.1690, $0.1700, and $0.200.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Celestia (TIA), a red-hot cryptocurrency in the modular blockchain space, has experienced a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks. After reaching a peak of nearly $16, TIA underwent a correction, plummeting to $7.5 according to CoinMarketCap data. However, the token has displayed remarkable resilience, bouncing back to $11.50 and showcasing strong trading volume – a sign that investors haven&#8217;t abandoned ship. Related Reading: Ethereum Fueled Up: Will 320 Million USDT Inflow Ignite Price Surge? Celestia&#8217;s Rebound And Investor Optimism The past 24 hours have been particularly kind to Celestia. The token price surged by a significant 6.20%, indicating a shift in investor sentiment towards optimism. This bullish momentum is further bolstered by analyst predictions and market psychology. TIA&#8217;s price action reveals a struggle between bullish and bearish forces. While the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 72 (&#8220;Greed&#8221;) and price predictions lean bullish, the current price of $11.70 remains significantly lower than its February 10th, 2024 ATH of $20.85. This signals a potential continuation of the downtrend. However, a key technical detail to note is the price staying above the cycle low of $7.61. This could indicate the beginning of a price recovery, but further technical analysis is necessary to confirm this. Some 46 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and KuCoin, allow traders to trade Celestia. Celestia changed hands for $549.60 million in the previous day. TIA is currently trading at $11.7. Chart: TradingView Celestia: Long-Term Potential And A Bullish Breakout Crypto analyst CryptoBullet has offered a long-term perspective on Celestia&#8217;s trajectory, focusing on its one-week chart. The analyst predicts a consolidation phase where TIA will likely trade below its previous high of $20 for an extended period. $TIA #Celestia 1W chart I think #TIA will consolidate below the $20 high for quite a while (maybe it will print a giant Symmetric Triangle, who knows) In my opinion, only after this re-accumulation $TIA will be ready to go much higher 📈 🎯 Macro target 1 &#8211; $70 🎯 Macro target… pic.twitter.com/xiFzY3CQEc — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) April 18, 2024 This consolidation could potentially form a bullish &#8220;Symmetric Triangle&#8221; pattern, a technical indicator often seen before significant price breakouts. CryptoBullet believes that after this consolidation and re-accumulation period, TIA will experience a substantial rise, with ambitious macro price targets set at a staggering $70 and even $130. While these targets are lofty, they highlight the analyst&#8217;s belief in Celestia&#8217;s long-term potential. Celestia&#8217;s Underlying Value Proposition The recent bullish sentiment surrounding Celestia isn&#8217;t solely driven by speculation. Celestia is a modular data availability network, a foundational technology that underpins the scalability and security of blockchains. By offering a secure platform for developers to launch their own blockchains, Celestia positions itself as a crucial piece of infrastructure in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. This underlying value proposition, coupled with the recent positive market forces, is propelling Celestia into the spotlight.

While predicting specific price points like $130 is inherently difficult in the volatile cryptocurrency market, Celestia&#8217;s future trajectory remains intriguing. Bullish sentiment and a Greed market mood suggest potential for price appreciation. However, the significant drop from its all-time high and the unknown influence of future news and developments necessitate caution. Technical analysis using indicators and monitoring upcoming events can provide more clarity on Celestia&#8217;s price direction. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView]]></description>

<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:288">This signals a potential continuation of the downtrend. However, a key technical detail to note is the price staying above the cycle low of $7.61. This could indicate the beginning of a price recovery, but further technical analysis is necessary to confirm this.</p>
<p>Some 46 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and KuCoin, allow traders to trade Celestia. Celestia changed hands for $549.60 million in the previous day.</p>

<h2 data-sourcepos="9:1-9:62"><strong>Celestia: Long-Term Potential And A Bullish Breakout</strong></h2>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:694">Crypto analyst CryptoBullet has offered a long-term perspective on Celestia&#8217;s trajectory, focusing on its one-week chart. The analyst predicts a consolidation phase where TIA will likely trade below its previous high of $20 for an extended period.</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#TIA</a> will consolidate below the $20 high for quite a while (maybe it will print a giant Symmetric Triangle, who knows)</p>

<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:694">This consolidation could potentially form a bullish &#8220;Symmetric Triangle&#8221; pattern, a technical indicator often seen before significant price breakouts. CryptoBullet believes that after this consolidation and re-accumulation period,</p>

<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:694">TIA will experience a substantial rise, with ambitious macro price targets set at a staggering $70 and even $130. While these targets are lofty, they highlight the analyst&#8217;s belief in Celestia&#8217;s long-term potential.</p>
<strong>Celestia&#8217;s Underlying Value Proposition</strong>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:527">The recent bullish sentiment surrounding Celestia isn&#8217;t solely driven by speculation. Celestia is a modular data availability network, a foundational technology that underpins the scalability and security of blockchains.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:527">By offering a secure platform for developers to launch their own blockchains, Celestia positions itself as a crucial piece of infrastructure in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. This underlying value proposition, coupled with the recent positive market forces, is propelling Celestia into the spotlight.</p>

<strong>Will TIA Reach $130?</strong>
<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:288">While predicting specific price points like $130 is inherently difficult in the volatile cryptocurrency market, Celestia&#8217;s future trajectory remains intriguing. Bullish sentiment and a Greed market mood suggest potential for price appreciation.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:288">However, the significant drop from its all-time high and the unknown influence of future news and developments necessitate caution. Technical analysis using indicators and monitoring upcoming events can provide more clarity on Celestia&#8217;s price direction.</p>

Ethereum is currently ranging around $3,170, with its price undergoing volatility in the past seven days.

Regulators in Hong Kong have greenlit the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs along with Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country, prompting investors to make strategic ETH movements in light of an incoming price surge.  Particularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a strategic accumulation pattern from ETH investors, with over $500 million worth of ETH leaving centralized exchanges in the past week.

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Bitcoin fell drastically towards the $60,000 mark in the days leading up to the just concluded halving. On-chain data has shed light on what could very well be the reason for this price dip in the middle of all the excitement around the halving. Related Reading: Ethereum Fueled Up: Will 320 Million USDT Inflow Ignite Price Surge? Particularly, data has revealed that some miners have been selling their holdings in the days leading up to the halving event, with the entire BTC holdings of miners hitting a 12-year low.  Miners&#8217; Bitcoin Holdings Hit 12-Year Low On-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock noted this interesting trend amongst Bitcoin miners. According to the platform&#8217;s &#8220;Miners&#8217; Bitcoin Holdings,&#8221; the collective BTC reserve across various miners has now dropped below 1.9 million BTC, its lowest in over 12 years. Interestingly, the metric shows that miner reserves have been on a continued trend of outflows since the beginning of the year, just after the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means the outflow from miner wallets can be linked to increased demand from the various Bitcoin ETF wallets, with the latter now controlling over 4.27% of the total circulating wallets. As Bitcoin goes into the halving, miners&#8217; BTC holdings hit 12 year low. This indicates that miners have been net sellers leading up to the halving. pic.twitter.com/WNi74RkluG — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 19, 2024 At the time of writing, CryptoQuant data puts the total number of miner reserves at 1.818 million BTC, a decrease of 22,000 BTC from 1.84 million on January 3. Additionally, this outflow from the miner reserves was exacerbated in the days leading up to the halving, as noted by IntoTheBlock. “This indicates that miners have been net sellers leading up to the halving,” IntoTheBlock said in a social media post. The persistent selling pressure exerted by miners may have been a contributing factor in Bitcoin&#8217;s stagnant pace between $65,000 and $70,000 over the past weeks. This outflow of BTC from miner wallets into the market seems to have flooded the market with more than enough BTC, which in turn contributed to a crash to $60,000 during the week.   Bitcoin is now trading at $64.906. Chart: TradingView What’s Next For Bitcoin? The practice of Bitcoin miners selling their holdings in the days leading up to the halving is not unusual, as demonstrated by their actions in past halving events. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,978, up 8% after rebounding up at $60,000. The much anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving has now been completed and the industry looks forward to its effect over the next few months.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Jumps On Growing Support From 1.4 Million Holders The halving is ultimately a balancing act for miners. Although miners’ revenues are cut in half, the reduced Bitcoin supply and possible price increase can help offset some of the losses over time.

					<description><![CDATA[With the Bitcoin halving event now completed, analysts and market experts turn their attention to a much-anticipated bull run based on historical trends in the BTC market.

However, other speculators have attacked this prediction, believing BTC will likely soon experience some level of diminishing returns. Thus, such a high price level seems unfeasible. In response, ecoinometrics stated that Bitcoin currently operates similarly to “megacap tech stocks”, which have shown notable defiance to this economic theory.

					<description><![CDATA[The DOGE price has largely struggled to make a return to $0.2 since losing this price level early in April. And the meme coin has mostly been on a descent over the past few weeks, going as low as $1.4 at some point. However, the tides appear to be shifting for the Dogecoin investors, with the meme token putting in a positive price performance in the past week. The double-digit gain and optimistic price action over the last seven days haven&#8217;t gone unnoticed by experts, as many anticipate a continued bullish run for the DOGE price in the near future. Is A Price Rally Imminent For Dogecoin? Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an interesting analysis and projection for the Dogecoin price. According to the pundit, DOGE’s recent price action is signaling a potential rally to the upside over the coming days. Related Reading: Battle For The Halving Block: Bitcoin Users Spend Record $2.4 Million On Block 840,000 The reasoning behind this bullish prediction revolves around the TD (Tom Demark) Sequential indicator. Martinez mentioned that this indicator has flashed a buy signal on Dogecoin’s daily chart, suggesting that a price upswing lasting between one to four days might be on the cards. The Tom Demark Sequential is an indicator in technical analysis used to identify potential points of trend exhaustion and price reversal. Typically, the TD Sequential indicator comprises two major phases known as the “setup” and the “countdown.”  The setup phase consists of nine consecutive candlesticks depending on whether the token is in a bullish or bearish trend. The countdown phase, on the other hand, consists of 13 consecutive candlesticks, which start immediately after the completion of the “setup.”  DOGE price chart showing the setup phase &#124; Source: Ali_charts/X In the chart highlighted above, the DOGE price just completed the nine-candle setup phase, which may be signaling a potential price reversal. Given that this phase was mostly formed by bearish candles, the TD Sequential might be indicating a bottom for Dogecoin’s price. Ultimately, it is likely that investors will see the DOGE price return to $0.2 if the potential rally produces four consecutive bullish candles. However, they might keep an eye out for the formation of the “countdown” phase. The completion of the countdown phase on Dogecoin’s daily chart could signal an even stronger and longer-lasting price reversal. This could see the meme token break out of its current bearish trend and gather some momentum for higher price levels. DOGE Price At A Glance As of this writing, the DOGE price stands at around $0.1618, reflecting a significant 4.7% increase in the past 24 hours.
