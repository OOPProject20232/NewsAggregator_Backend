										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is a guest post by Mark Gofaizen, Senior Partner at Gofaizen &amp; Sherle.<br />
</em></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the MiCA regulation that will reshape the crypto industry approaches, crypto companies need to ensure compliance for a smooth transition.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto-asset market regulation (MiCA), which represents an important step by the European Union (EU) towards regulating the crypto-asset market, is one of the hot topics of 2024. MiCA seeks to infuse the market with clarity and security, addressing the needs of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and issuers while safeguarding investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies operating in the crypto space, MiCA clearly calls for changes to their processes in order to adapt to the new regulatory environment. Covering topics ranging from operational flexibility to consumer protection, MiCA ensures that the crypto asset market is sustainable and compliant with wider financial market regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry stakeholders and companies need support and guidance during this transition period. This article will cover how MiCA can impact companies, focusing on processes that need attention, potential cost increases, and staffing needs.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Core Requirements Under MiCA</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto industry is on the verge of a regulatory evolution, with the draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) outlined by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). These forthcoming standards, anticipated to be presented to the European Commission by June 30, 2024, are crucial for CASPs aiming to secure a MiCA license.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential aspects of MiCA include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Anti-Money Laundering (AML): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASPs must adhere to a comprehensive suite of laws and procedures to prevent the disguise of illicit funds as legitimate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crypto-asset service providers are responsible for measures to prevent the flow of funds to terrorist organizations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Authorized Capital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASPs are required to define the maximum capital they can issue, as stated in their charter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customer Due Diligence (CDD): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto-asset service providers must verify customer identities and assess transactional risks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASPs must have procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to competent authorities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cooperation and Information Sharing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooperating with competent authorities and sharing necessary information is another obligation for CASPs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These foundational requirements align CASPs with broader fiscal and regulatory expectations, tailoring to their unique operational frameworks.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Aligning with Wider Financial Regulations</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MiCA&#8217;s introduction necessitates comprehensive adjustments across CASP operations, underscoring the necessity for a holistic strategy to foster a transparent, secure, and consumer-centric crypto market in sync with broader financial regulations.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Key business process areas for review include:</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Personnel Training and Recruitment</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To comply with MiCA, companies need to create a team specializing in regulatory compliance specific to financial services or crypto assets. Acquiring risk management experts and legal advisors is crucial to tackling the complexities of MiCA. These professionals will be instrumental in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks and ensuring all company operations fully comply with the new regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASPs should have at least one person from senior management (director) located in the country of establishment and organize activity through the place of business in the EU.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Data</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MiCA mandates the protection of consumer information and the segregation of customer assets. Companies must ensure compliance with privacy and data protection by developing secure systems for collecting and using personal data. Additionally, the regulation requires implementing customer separation systems to protect customer assets, a measure aimed at improving consumer protection in the crypto market.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Reporting and Accounting</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies must improve their reporting and accounting practices to meet MiCA&#8217;s transparency and accountability standards. These standards include accurately reporting financial transactions and keeping company records compliant with regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Advisory Services for Crypto Assets Users</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MiCA significantly emphasizes the quality of advisory services provided to crypto asset users. Companies offering advisory services must ensure that advice is personalized, transparent, fair, and not misleading, considering the client&#8217;s personal circumstances, investment objectives, and risk appetite.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Crypto Exchange Services and Related Policies</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies providing crypto exchange services, MiCA seeks to ensure fair and orderly trading, set rules for order execution, and provide clear information on the exchange of crypto assets. The regulation aims to improve the integrity and stability of crypto exchange services by promoting a safer trading environment for consumers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>MiCA: An Opportunity, Not a Challenge</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of MiCA is a milestone for the cryptoasset market in the European Union and sets a precedent for regulatory frameworks worldwide. As we approach a new era of compliance and regulation, companies in the crypto sector are being given a transition period until June 2025. With the proposed changes being submitted to institutions for coordination and feedback by March 28, the regulatory changes are expected to create a more secure and reliable crypto environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As companies seek to comply with regulations, focusing on strategic planning, investing in compliance infrastructure, and developing a knowledgeable compliance team becomes extremely important. Embracing MiCA not just as a compliance challenge but as an opportunity to increase operational integrity and consumer trust can position companies for success in the increasingly regulated global crypto market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is a guest post by Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo Blockchain.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From AI Models on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> to AI training data on a layer 2 blockchain, coins linked to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/ai/">AI crypto</a> projects are all the rage in the altcoin universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a reflection of broader market conditions. Hot stock Nvidia (NVDA.O) has stolen headlines since last year and put AI on the investing map. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That stock </span><strong><a href="https://www.bankrate.com/investing/trillion-dollar-companies/#:~:text=Nvidia%20(NVDA),a%20boom%20in%20artificial%20intelligence.">became</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the seventh public U.S. company valued at over $1 trillion. By March 2024, it became the world’s third most valuable company after Microsoft and Apple as the market cap </span><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-04/nvidia-leaps-aramco-to-be-world-s-third-most-valuable-company">eclipsed</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $2 trillion. Investors yearn for exposure to machine learning technology at a clip that rivals the world’s largest companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI tokens at the time of writing have a market value of $26.4 billion. Last April, that number was a mere $2.7 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CoinDesk Indices Computing Index includes AI-linked tokens and has increased more than 165% in the past 12 months. And trading volumes hit an all-time high of $3.8 billion in late February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many investors are chasing price gains, AI-linked crypto tokens provide an opportunity in crypto that is at the same time uncorrelated to crypto. These tokens&#8217; values are arguably more tied to the fate of the AI sector than to crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment manager VanEck predicts that AI crypto revenue could reach a whopping $10.2 billion by 2030 on the low end with use cases similar to non-AI crypto projects—reward tokens, physical computation infrastructure, data verification, provenance, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be sure, the AI blockchain revolution remains in its infancy. How the merger of these two exciting industries plays out is unknown. Bitcoin Maximalists, for instance, believe the entire crypto index could go to zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a long list of possible uses for AI tokens. Payments, trading models, machine-generated non-fungible tokens and blockchain-based marketplaces for AI applications to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theoretically, blockchain improves the security of protocols with a decentralized and immutable settlement layer.</span></p>
<p>AI detects risks in real-time and provides an extra layer of security monitoring network activities, analyzing historical and provenance data and asset conditions, discovering anomalies, using predictive analytics to make smart contract conditions more efficient, and analyzing provenance data, asset conditions, and market trends.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a system where these two novel technologies pull and verify data while managing network loads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain could be a public record of AI training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI algorithms improve threat detection and response; blockchain’s immutability of security-related data provides a robust defense against cyber threats paired with a decentralized approach to data management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the AI-verified information is recorded to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the merger of AI and blockchain poses threats.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Risks Of AI And Blockchain </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations General Assembly adopted March 21, a global artificial intelligence (AI) resolution promoting “safe, secure, and trustworthy” AI development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Parliament passed March 13 an AI Act to set governance standards for the Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the European Commission </span><strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/european-commission-asks-for-ai-risk-data-from-google-facebook-x-and-five-others/">launched a probe</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the use of AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration&#8217;s October 2023 executive order notes AI development&#8217;s safety and security problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, India </span><strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/india-mandates-regulatory-approval-before-ai-tools-are-launched/">introduced AI requirements</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March before the national elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI and blockchain, both alone and combined, pose privacy and security risks. Vast amounts of sensitive data could one day depend on the security of AI-blockchain apps, and how these might be secured remains unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI requires vast amounts of data to learn, predict, and act. The data could become increasingly personal over time, posing a greater risk to privacy. Blockchain can counteract these risks by anonymizing data transactions to protect identity with methods including zero-knowledge proofs and also creating an immutable and often public record. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data recorded to a public blockchain can be deleted by nobody, presenting a conflict with privacy norms and laws such as the right to be forgotten. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theoretical potential for AI to act on data secured by blockchain without human oversight raises significant questions about consent and privacy. </span></p>
<h2><b>Fostering Beneficial Innovation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the quest to harness blockchain and AI without dystopia, the world must be guided by ethical principles and safety standards so that these technologies end up serving humanity&#8217;s best interests and solving our most pressing needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A collaborative approach among developers, ethicists, and policymakers is needed to delineate clear boundaries for AI behavior and data integrity on blockchain networks. Developers must design innovative solutions to protect privacy and security in the new digital frontier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principles of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity ensure that AI and blockchain systems are designed with an understanding of their societal impacts. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/ftx/">FTX</a> investors may drop claims against the company&#8217;s co-founder and former CEO, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, in return for his support.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported on <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ftx-investors-settle-with-sam-bankman-fried-to-pursue-promoters-1.2061522">April 19</a> that, under a proposed settlement, Bankman-Fried would cooperate against celebrity promoters named as defendants in a $1.3 million civil lawsuit.</p>
<p>The civil case currently names celebrities as defendants, including former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, former NBA player Shaquille O&#8217;Neal, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs allege that the celebrities brought them into a Ponzi scheme by promoting FTX.</p>
<h2>SBF would provide information</h2>
<p>To cooperate, Bankman-Fried would need to provide plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers with details about entities related to FTX, including venture capital firms that invested in the exchange and accountants and lawyers that worked with the company during its operations.</p>
<p>He would also provide nonprivileged documents outlining his investments in the AI company <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/anthropic/">Anthropic</a> and an affidavit proving his negative net worth.</p>
<p>In exchange for Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cooperation, plaintiffs would drop current and future claims against him. Bloomberg said that plaintiffs acknowledged Bankman-Fried&#8217;s participation as &#8220;valuable&#8221; but recognized that the shift in focus could make their case&#8217;s outcome uncertain.</p>
<p>The judge must decide whether to approve the proposal.</p>
<h2>Past developments</h2>
<p>The relevant case, currently proceeding in the Southern District of Florida, brings together several civil lawsuits against various FTX promoters and insiders.</p>
<p>Several other defendants previously approached a settlement. A March 27 filing named FTX insiders Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, former FTX lawyer Daniel Friedberg, several internet personalities, and AFL quarterback William Trevor Lawrence as proposed settling defendants. The current status of the proposal is unclear.</p>
<p>Much earlier, in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/tom-brady-other-celebrities-ask-court-to-dismiss-lawsuit-over-promoting-ftx/">April 2023</a>, some celebrity promoters <span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">—</span></span> including but not limited to Brady and Bundchen <span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">—</span></span> asked the court to dismiss claims. The relevant case, Garrison v. Bankman-Fried et al., became part of the consolidated case by June 2023.</p>
<p>All civil cases are distinct from the high-profile criminal case against Bankman-Fried, which has concluded. Bankman-Fried was convicted on criminal charges in November 2023 and received a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-to-25-years-in-landmark-fraud-case/">24-year prison sentence</a> in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The IRS published a draft version of its 1099-DA reporting form and controversially included unhosted crypto wallets among its targets on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f1099da--dft.pdf">April 19</a>.</p>
<p>Ji Kim, Chief Legal and Policy officer at the Crypto Council for Innovation, <a href="https://twitter.com/_jikim/status/1781401395633013130">wrote that</a> the IRS&#8217; approach is &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; as it does not recognize that unhosted wallet providers lack knowledge about crypto transactions and the parties involved in each transaction.</p>
<p>Shehan Chandrasekera, Head of Tax at CoinTracker, similarly criticized the form. He <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1781403344172359826">argued</a> the effects could spill over to end users, who may need to engage in KYC verification when they create unhosted wallets or use unhosted wallets with services such as DeFi platforms.</p>
<p>However, Chandrasekera said that authorities will likely aim their enforcement efforts at unhosted wallet providers instead of end users.</p>
<p>Unhosted or non-custodial wallets do not store crypto balances with a third-party service. They are distinct from custodial wallets, a category that includes most exchange wallets.</p>
<h2>Form 1099-DA</h2>
<p>Form 1099-DA also asks brokers to provide certain on-chain data, including transaction IDs and wallet addresses related to each sale. Brokers should report the transaction ID and address originating the sold crypto — and a secondary address if they &#8220;transferred in&#8221; the funds from another of their hosted wallet addresses.</p>
<p>Experts responded to the requirement differently. Chandrasekera warned that collecting and reporting data, especially wallet addresses, &#8220;could lead to major privacy and security concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Ledgible&#8217;s VP of Tax Information Reporting, Jessalyn Dean, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledgiblecrypto/status/1781325785543913583">noted</a> an exception to the rule. She said the form allows brokers not to provide addresses and transaction IDs if not applicable. She called the exception &#8220;necessary&#8221; because brokers often perform transactions in their internal recordkeeping systems rather than on-chain.</p>
<p>Another critical section reads, &#8220;Wash sale loss disallowed.&#8221; According to Dean, this does not bring crypto under wash sale rules. Instead, the section applies to digital assets currently subject to wash sale rules, such as stock, securities, and tokenized equities.</p>
<h2>Rules not yet finalized</h2>
<p>Crypto brokerage reporting rules have been in the making for some time. President Joe Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infrastructure Act</a> in 2021 categorized certain crypto services as brokers in 2021. In August 2023, the Treasury and the IRS published a proposal for 1099-DA that largely resembles the contents of today&#8217;s draft form.</p>
<p>However, the draft form&#8217;s text indicates that the IRS has not finalized the form and that brokers should not use it in their current tax reports.</p>
<p>According to Ledgible, there is a 60-day comment period on the form.</p>
<p>The IRS has established separate rules for individual crypto investors. The regulator published a reminder on April 11 that crypto investors should report on various forms, including Form 1040. A top IRS member also <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/top-irs-member-says-pure-crypto-tax-crimes-on-the-rise-alongside-scams/">recently warned</a> of tax avoidance among crypto investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) unveiled the Finney Freedom Prize on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a> fourth <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-halving-interest-higher-than-ever-with-under-12-hours-left-to-go/">halving day</a> to celebrate the flagship crypto for enabling greater financial freedom for the world.</p>
<p>The award is designed to honor significant global achievements in Bitcoin and human rights, reflecting Finney&#8217;s vision of using technology as a tool for liberation.</p>
<p>The inaugural Finney Freedom Prize was awarded posthumously to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/hal-finney/">Hal Finney</a>, recognizing his pioneering work during Bitcoin&#8217;s first halving era from 2009 to 2012. Finney&#8217;s widow, Fran Finney, who accepted the award on his behalf, chose to donate the prize to charity and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe this prize will ensure Hal&#8217;s legacy endures, inspiring future generations to explore and expand the use of Bitcoin as a tool for achieving personal and collective freedom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Finney, who succumbed to ALS in 2014, was a staunch advocate for civil liberties and a key figure in the early development of Bitcoin. He was the first person, after Bitcoin&#8217;s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to operate the software and partake in Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<h2>110-year legacy</h2>
<p>The Finney Freedom Prize will be distributed every four years on subsequent Bitcoin halving days, with a total of 28 awards slated over the next 110 years. The initiative is supported by a 33 BTC fund established by HRF.</p>
<p>Laureates will be recognized for their contributions to Bitcoin and human rights within specific halving periods and will receive a monetary prize of 1 Bitcoin (BTC) along with a physical award.</p>
<p>Nominations and selections for future laureates will be managed by the Genesis Committee, composed of notable figures in the Bitcoin community, including Farida Nabourema, Lisa Neigut, and Obi Nwosu, among others.</p>
<p>The committee will evaluate candidates based on their educational efforts about Bitcoin, contributions to its technology, promotion of decentralization, and efforts to enhance Bitcoin&#8217;s accessibility, particularly under oppressive regimes.</p>
<p>, with 1 BTC allocated for each award over the remaining halving events. Hal Finney&#8217;s Bitcoin will be donated to charity as directed by his widow, Fran Finney, who said:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/chainalysis/">Chanalysis</a> submitted a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polkadot/">Polkadot</a> governance proposal on <a href="https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/684">April 18</a> that could lead to a $10 million partnership.</p>
<p>The services provided by Chainalysis will include monitoring and tracing the DOT token activities on the Relay Chain, ensuring visibility of any potentially risky on-chain actions to regulators and institutional entities. This approach is aimed at maintaining a good standing with regulatory bodies and fostering a risk-aware environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chainalysis will offer on-chain intelligence solutions to meet institutional requirements related to the listing of the DOT token, covering aspects such as investigations, compliance, and growth use cases.</p>
<p>The partnership would also include plans to engage in joint events, announcements, and case studies to promote the collaboration and highlight Chainalysis&#8217;s role in supporting Polkadot&#8217;s compliance framework.</p>
<p>The partnership would additionally offer on-chain intelligence to authorized institutional clients to support DOT token listings. The two companies would also collaborate in various areas to promote the compliance partnership.</p>
<h2>Little early support</h2>
<p>Chainalysis&#8217; proposal requests 1,000,000 of Polkadot&#8217;s DOT tokens or the equivalent value in US dollars (currently $6.82 million) for a three-year agreement. Chainalysis proposed the plan and will be the beneficiary if the plan succeeds.</p>
<p>So far, the proposal has received little support from members of the Pokadot community. A Polkadot ambassador with the handle Georgi_PS initially funded the proposal with a 400 DOT deposit. Since then, 11 voters have used 36,350 DOT to vote against the plan.</p>
<p>If the proposal succeeds, it could provide particular benefits. The proposal states that the Polkadot community aims to use Chainalysis software to improve market capitalization, market share, adoption, and popularity among institutions. It would also prevent fines and reputational damage resulting from regulatory issues.</p>
<p>Voting is scheduled to conclude by a May 16 deadline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/hashkey-capital/">HashKey</a> said it would end support for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/binance/">Binance</a>-related transactions next month.</p>
<p>In an April 19 <a href="https://support.hashkey.com/hc/en-gb/articles/31422460616473-Notify-users-Cessation-of-VA-transfers-with-Binance-hosted-wallet-address-es">statement</a>, the Hong Kong-based crypto trading platform stated that it would restrict deposits from Binance starting May 10 and end support for virtual asset withdrawals to Binance-hosted wallet addresses by May 17.</p>
<p>However, transactions involving virtual assets to whitelisted unhosted wallet addresses will remain unaffected. These addresses are verified and authenticated by the exchange.</p>
<p>HashKey attributed its decision to &#8220;a change in its policy&#8221; but did not provide additional details about the new rules.</p>
<p>In December 2023, HashKey <a href="https://support.hashkey.com/hc/en-gb/articles/26473664750489-HashKey-Exchange-Virtual-Assets-Deposit-Guidelines-General">terminated</a> support for crypto deposits from all third-party exchanges except Binance. At the time, the exchange announced it would only accept deposits exceeding 8,000 HKD from Binance, subject to specific guidelines.</p>
<p>HashKey Exchange is one of the few licensed exchanges in Hong Kong and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hashkey-exchange-set-to-debut-retail-crypto-trading-services-in-hong-kong-on-aug-28/">caters </a>to both institutional and retail investors.</p>
<h2>Binance regulatory woes</h2>
<p class="s3">HashKey&#8217;s decision further compounds Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/binances-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty-to-money-laundering-comments-on-resignation/">woes</a> across various legal jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Last month, an entity linked to the Richard Teng-crypto trading platform in Hong Kong, HKVAEX, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/binance-backed-hkvaex-shuts-down-gives-users-30-days-to-withdraw-amid-hong-kong-regulatory-tightening/">abruptly closed operations</a> and withdrew its application for licensing.</p>
<p>Amid the drama, the Nigerian authorities detained two executives from the platform and accused the exchange of exacerbating its foreign exchange challenges.</p>
<p>However, Binance has recently <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/binance-enhances-safu-fund-stability-through-usdc-amid-regulatory-progress-in-dubai-and-india/">adopted</a> a compliance-first approach and made significant strides in its regulatory push, particularly in India and Dubai.</p>
<h2>HashKey&#8217;s advancements</h2>
<p>Over the past month, HashKey has made notable advancements in its operations.</p>
<p>On April 15, HashKey Capital said it received regulatory clearance to co-launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Bosera International.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the platform told <em>CryptoSlate</em> that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) approved upgrading its existing License 9 to enable it to offer virtual asset fund product services to retail investors.</p>
<p>Before that, the firm had unveiled a global crypto trading platform that received licensing in Bermuda to provide digital asset trading services. This platform will operate in numerous countries, excluding China and the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/bitwise/">Bitwise</a> CIO Matt Hougan cast doubt on whether current prices truly capture the potential impact of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitwise-cio-expects-institutions-to-inject-over-1-trillion-into-bitcoin-via-etfs/">increased demand</a> following Bitcoin&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-halving-interest-higher-than-ever-with-under-12-hours-left-to-go/">upcoming halving</a> based on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH).</p>
<p>Hougan <a href="https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan/status/1781301232315064671">raised critical questions</a> about the limitations of EMH in anticipating what the market will be like post-halving. He pointed out that while EMH suggests that <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a> current price reflects all available information, including the anticipated supply cut from the halving — it does not account for unexpected shifts in market demand.</p>
<p>Hougan said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The halving is well known, so today’s price reflects that it will occur&#8230; [but] what if future demand for bitcoin is higher than the market currently anticipates?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bitwise CIO added that the market might have already priced in the direct effects of the halving, but the hypothesis cannot anticipate the level of future demand.</p>
<p>Hougan referenced Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller&#8217;s work, which highlights the discrepancies between EMH predictions and actual market behavior, to support his arguments.</p>
<p>Shiller&#8217;s research suggests that while EMH may be applicable on a micro-scale to individual stocks, broader market trends can defy these predictions.</p>
<h2>Forced vs. willing sellers</h2>
<p>Hougan also delved into the dynamic between &#8220;forced&#8221; and &#8220;willing&#8221; sellers within the Bitcoin ecosystem. He explained that miners, who face high operational costs, are primarily forced sellers and will see their contributions to market supply drop significantly post-halving.</p>
<p>This reduction shifts the market trend toward willing sellers, who have to be compelled to let go of their Bitcoin by offering higher prices. Willing sellers mostly comprise long-term holders.</p>
<p>He argued that this shift could create &#8220;significant upward price pressure&#8221; if the market has indeed underestimated future demand, suggesting a bullish outcome as increased demand meets a limited supply.</p>
<p>As the bitcoin community and investors around the globe prepare for the halving, Hougan&#8217;s critical analysis provides a thought-provoking perspective on how traditional economic theories like the EMH apply to the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto markets.</p>
<p>His insights suggest that investors should consider potential deviations from established market predictions, underscoring the complexities and uncertainties that come with crypto investments.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was trading at $64,300 as of press time, roughly seven hours away from its fourth halving.</p>
