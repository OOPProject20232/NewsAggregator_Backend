										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>North Korea&#8217;s state-sponsored hacking collective Lazarus group is reportedly targeting LinkedIn users in the digital asset industry as part of its latest crypto hacking malware attempt, blockchain security firm SlowMist alleged on April 24.</span></p>
<p><span>“The Lazarus Group is currently contacting cryptocurrency industry targets through LinkedIn and stealing employee privileges or assets through malware,” <a href="https://twitter.com/im23pds/status/1782984061369405878">SlowMist posted to its X account</a>. </span></p>
<h2>North Korean Crypto Hacking Group Targeting LinkedIn Users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>The blockchain security company alleged that Lazarus Group members were creating fake profiles on the networking site, reaching out to human resources personnel, and hiring managers in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/blockchain-technology/">various blockchain-related</a> organizations. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="zh" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lazarus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Lazarus</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#APT</a> The Lazarus group appears to be currently reaching out to targets via LinkedIn and steal employee privileges or assets through malware.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lazarus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Lazarus</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#APT</a> Lazarus 组织目前正通过 LinkedIn 联系加密货币行业的目标，并通过恶意软件窃取员工权限或资产。<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9d0.png" alt="🧐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; 23pds (@im23pds) <a href="https://twitter.com/im23pds/status/1782984061369405878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>From there, the North Korean hackers send a link with code in an attempt to show off their coding abilities. In reality, the cryptography contains dangerous malware <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm">to exploit the victim’s personal data</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>“Initial declarations and dependency loading scripts throw errors immediately when they start, probably to confuse analyzers or automated tools,” SlowMist stated. “Several Node.js modules are imported, and environment variables and function definitions define the operating system&#8217;s hostname, platform type, home directory, and temporary directories.</span></p>
<p><span>A periodic function, aptly named “stealEverything,” then “attempts to steal as much data as possible from the user&#8217;s device and upload it to a server controlled by the attacker.”</span></p>
<h2>Lazarus Group&#8217;s Ties To North Korea&#8217;s WMD Program</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>A report from a U.N. panel of experts published last month revealed that an estimated <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/north-korea-weapons-mass-destruction-funding-cyber-hacking-vdbs0g9xz">40% of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction</a> (WMD) were funded through “illicit cyber means.”</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-koreas-cyber-activities-crypto-theft-fuel-half-of-foreign-currency-revenue-un.htm">Lazarus Group has stolen</a> over $3 billion worth of digital assets globally to date.</span></p>
<p><span>A recent blockchain intelligence firm <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/north-korean-hackers-stole-600-million-in-crypto-in-2023#:~:text=Hackers%20tied%20to%20North%20Korea,to%20around%20USD%20700%20million.">TRM Labs report found</a> that the authoritarian country stole over $600 million in 2023 alone.</span></p>
<p><span>Security officials from the U.S. and its allies believe the country’s state-sponsored malware initiatives may threaten national security.</span></p>
<p><span>In December, U.S. advisor of National Security, Jake Sullivan, held a meeting with diplomatic counterparts from South Korea and Japan in which they discussed North Korea’s WMD program.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year, the U.S. sanctioned crypto mixer Sinbad, a “key money-laundering tool” for the regime’s digital asset exploitation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span>“The Treasury Department and its U.S. government partners stand ready to deploy all tools at their disposal to prevent virtual currency mixers, like Sinbad, from facilitating illicit activities,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said following <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1933">the enforcement action</a>. “While we encourage responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem, we will not hesitate to take action against illicit actors.”</span></p>
<p><span>It&#8217;s unclear whether the Lazarus Group will face any political repercussions over its latest crypto malware scheme.</span></p>

<p>The gains appear to have been largely spurred on by the news last night that American crypto exchange giant Coinbase has launched PEPE perpetual futures trading.</p>

<p>However, PEPE isn&#8217;t the only funny token rallying sharply today. In fact, among those rallying by double-digit percentage figures, PEPE is a little behind.</p>
<p>DogWifHat (WIF) grew 20% over the last 24 hours to change hands at <span>$3.37, Floki (FLOKI) added 16% to trade at $0.0001998, while BONK mushroomed a staggering 33% to hit $0.00002701 as of this writing. </span></p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins</a> are faring much better than the market leaders today.</p>
<p>The original and biggest cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) remains unchanged from yesterday at around <span>$66,395. Its closest contender <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH), the most commercially important blockchain, added a slight 2% to trade at $3,245. </span></p>
<p>PEPE&#8217;s trading chart outlines the rollercoaster ride that many meme coins have been on over the last three months. The end of February began a rally that saw PEPE reaching a new high watermark of <span data-price-target="price" data-price-json="{&quot;aed&quot;:3.9071630922688516e-05,&quot;ars&quot;:0.009039489886903437,&quot;aud&quot;:1.6075951216590315e-05,&quot;bch&quot;:3.578376374000255e-08,&quot;bdt&quot;:0.0011672805528954724,&quot;bhd&quot;:4.0097222672329556e-06,&quot;bmd&quot;:1.0637815056954612e-05,&quot;bnb&quot;:2.021898910225349e-08,&quot;brl&quot;:5.287898297586283e-05,&quot;btc&quot;:1.4588261539646338e-10,&quot;cad&quot;:1.4334715422464258e-05,&quot;chf&quot;:9.358245472828825e-06,&quot;clp&quot;:0.010061990127921664,&quot;cny&quot;:7.65124847971461e-05,&quot;czk&quot;:0.0002456594035203351,&quot;dkk&quot;:7.252040002727749e-05,&quot;dot&quot;:1.1171675773708826e-06,&quot;eos&quot;:9.645867200227227e-06,&quot;eth&quot;:2.6781135463382433e-09,&quot;eur&quot;:9.725750069601435e-06,&quot;gbp&quot;:8.31582700628491e-06,&quot;gel&quot;:2.8190209900929692e-05,&quot;hkd&quot;:8.321085099313387e-05,&quot;huf&quot;:0.0038538825530502205,&quot;idr&quot;:0.16579938980543535,&quot;ils&quot;:3.868790113669988e-05,&quot;inr&quot;:0.0008815752541604583,&quot;jpy&quot;:0.0015732297419223371,&quot;krw&quot;:0.01401898619368475,&quot;kwd&quot;:3.2676921157501527e-06,&quot;lkr&quot;:0.0032546843018766477,&quot;ltc&quot;:1.1072223716740448e-07,&quot;mmk&quot;:0.022325131916649563,&quot;mxn&quot;:0.00017749453985216137,&quot;myr&quot;:4.986475807947468e-05,&quot;ngn&quot;:0.01709901116624765,&quot;nok&quot;:0.00011156095930908122,&quot;nzd&quot;:1.7272120330669586e-05,&quot;php&quot;:0.000589217959465289,&quot;pkr&quot;:0.0029674185101374886,&quot;pln&quot;:4.165717314791149e-05,&quot;rub&quot;:0.0009728227935862656,&quot;sar&quot;:3.98950297215421e-05,&quot;sek&quot;:0.00010895032106124242,&quot;sgd&quot;:1.4180877169398504e-05,&quot;thb&quot;:0.0003795412845095556,&quot;try&quot;:0.00034171746929304763,&quot;twd&quot;:0.00033521882807475333,&quot;uah&quot;:0.0004121206675407987,&quot;usd&quot;:1.0637815056954612e-05,&quot;vef&quot;:1.0651644216528657e-06,&quot;vnd&quot;:0.2626945355964822,&quot;xag&quot;:4.270214896120167e-07,&quot;xau&quot;:4.9056284135146126e-09,&quot;xdr&quot;:7.958989831497241e-06,&quot;xlm&quot;:7.153564235072883e-05,&quot;xrp&quot;:1.5703854755902642e-05,&quot;yfi&quot;:1.1066861912175402e-09,&quot;zar&quot;:0.00019798020683430722,&quot;bits&quot;:0.00014588261539646337,&quot;link&quot;:5.973649400699496e-07,&quot;sats&quot;:0.014588261539646338}" data-prev-price="0.000010637815056954612">$0.00001064 on March 14.

<p>PEPE is currently in recovery mode.</p>
<p>Its value is going up, but its Relative Strength Index is 65 and falling, indicating that the latest spate of buying (prompted by the Coinbase announcement) is cooling off. Still, PEPE is not likely to lose much from this downturn in the short-term.</p>

<h2>Pepe the Frog, or Slothana the Sloth?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pepe is a massively successful meme coin because, like its rivals Dogecoin, Bonk and DogWifHat, the underlying meme that inspired it has oodles of cultural capital.</p>
<p>However, dog coins and Pepe are beginning to feel like meme coins from a different era. Crypto has changed very rapidly over the last few months, thanks largely to pivotal market narratives such as the launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and Bitcoin&#8217;s fourth quadrennial halving update last weekend.</p>
<p>In short, the jokes around Pepe and the dog coins run the risk of getting stale.</p>
<p><span>Enter Solana&#8217;s latest meme coin sensation Slothana ($SLOTH). From the clock on the wall indicating 4:20 to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is clearly cut from a different cloth. </span></p>
<p>Slothana has raised<span> </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-whales-are-accumulating-this-new-solana-meme-coin-before-it-lists-on-exchanges-what-do-they-know.htm">over $15 million</a><span> </span>in his ICO as traders flocked to the coin hoping to catch some of the early price booms of other Solana meme legends that have pumped recently, like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHIB has risen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/shib-shiba-inu/">the Shiba Inu price</a> reaching $0.00002713 on a day when the crypto market as a whole has gained by 1%.</p>
<p>The token has now increased by 21% in a week, with its returns coming as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins make a recovery across the board</a>.</p>
<p>But with SHIB still down by 2.5% in the last 30 days, it still has plenty of space to recover further in the coming days.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case when Shiba Inu remains one of the strongest meme coins in terms of its fundamentals, with this week seeing the announcement of a $12 million raise for the coin&#8217;s new layer-three network.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Meme Coins Bounce Back – Can SHIB Overtake Ethereum?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It&#8217;s debatable as to what SHIB is going to do in the near term, with its indicators looking as though it may need to dip a little before we see more gains.</p>
<p>Its 30-day average (orange) has been above its 200-day (average) for a few days now, and while it may hang in there for a few days yet, it seems to have lost momentum.</p>
<figure id="attachment_203046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203046" style="width: 4310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-203046" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="4310" height="2396" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 4310w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x167.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x569.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x427.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x854.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1139.png 2048w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24110641/1713956797-shiba-inu-price-chart-150x83.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4310px) 100vw, 4310px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-203046" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, SHIB&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) is hovering around the 50 mark, having declined from 80 a few days ago and looking like it may drop towards 30 or 20 before picking up again.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s discouraging for SHIB is that its trading volume today is $700 million, in contrast to the $13 billion levels we saw in early March.</p>
<p>Clearly, major demand has not yet returned to Shiba Inu, which may seesaw between recovery and dips for as long as it struggles to attract new volume.</p>

<p>&mdash; Whale Alert (@whale_alert) <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1782930203393565004?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Having said that, the very early hours of this morning did see a SHIB transfer worth $79.9 million between two unknown wallets.</p>
<p>This suggests that some whales may have begun accumulating the token again, and that we may be at the beginning of an uptrend.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s arguable that such a trend began when Shiba Inu&#8217;s developers <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoshibs/status/1782881954440028257">announced they had raised $12 million for its new privacy-focused layer-three network</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no release date yet for this new network, although what is known is that it will have its own native TREAT token, which will be the final non-stablecoin Shiba Inu ecosystem coin.</p>
<p>This launch points to sustained future growth for Shiba Inu and the Shiba Inu price, which could reach $0.000040 by the summer.</p>
<h2>New High-Potential Meme Tokens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While SHIB is undoubtedly one of the most solid meme coins in the market, there are other, smaller cap tokens that could be worth a look if traders wish to maximize their exposure to the potential upside.</p>
<p>In fact, there are several <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coins/">promising meme coins</a> in the market right now that boast some very strong fundamentals, and that are also holding their presales and generating plenty of momentum.</p>
<p><span></span>One of the best of these is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/">Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE)</a><span>, a multi-chain meme token that has raised over $10 million in its sale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let’s go! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOGEVERSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DOGEVERSE</a> raises over $10 Million! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>As the first ever Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, DOGEVERSE will operate on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.</span></p>
<p>This will give it very wide application, with the token potentially finding usage on numerous apps within numerous ecosystems.</p>
<p>As such, it could experience strong demand, which in turn will boost its price over time, especially when it comes with a hard cap of 200 million tokens.</p>
<p>On top of this, holders will be able to stake the token, earning themselves a passive income while also taking much of the DOGEVERSE supply out of circulation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dogeverse Meme Coin Raises $10,000,000 - Best Crypto to Buy Now?!?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZn6pDPqW9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In other words, DOGEVERSE could rise strongly in price, with investors able to buy it early and cheaply by going to <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/">the official Dogeverse website</a>.</p>
<p>1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000301, although this will rise in just under a day.</p>
<p>And given that meme coins have outperformed much of the market this year, this price could surge dramatically once the token lists on trading platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jack Dorsey&#8217;s payments company Block has shifted its focus from designing chips to developing a full Bitcoin mining system.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.mining.build/latest-updates-3nm-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent blog post</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Block unveiled its accomplishment of designing a standalone three-nanometer (3nm) Bitcoin mining chip and disclosed that it is currently collaborating with a leading global semiconductor foundry to finalize the chip&#8217;s design. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the company&#8217;s mining project doesn&#8217;t stop at chip development. It plans to expand its efforts to include system design as well.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We’ve spent a significant amount of time talking to a wide variety of </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> miners to identify the challenges faced by mining operators,” the announcement reads.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Building on these insights and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">pursuant to</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> our goal of supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone mining chip as well as a full mining system of our </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">own</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> design.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Block Aims to Decentralize Supply of Mining Hardware</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Concerns over network stability and hardware vulnerabilities have long plagued the Bitcoin community. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ASIC chips used in mining rigs are predominantly manufactured in China, a country that has exhibited hostility towards the cryptocurrency sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jack Dorsey&#8217;s Block initiative aims to decentralize the supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate, which serves as a measure of industry competition and mining difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One major obstacle that Block seeks to overcome is the limited availability and high cost of mining rigs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, the company aims to improve the user experience and reliability of mining operations, addressing common issues such as heat dissipation and noise production.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While specific details regarding the mining system are scarce in the announcement, Dorsey had previously mentioned the possibility of a &#8220;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> mining system based on custom silicon.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also emphasized the need for more vertical integration and diversification in silicon design, which he believes is currently concentrated among a few companies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest development comes shortly after the most recent Bitcoin halving, which occurred recently and reduced the issuance of new Bitcoin by half. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dorsey&#8217;s vision of accessible mining extends beyond generating new Bitcoin. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Mining needs to be more distributed. The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the bitcoin network becomes.”</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Square is considering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide. If we do this, we’d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community. First some thoughts and questions.</p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Block Backs Gridless</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Block&#8217;s venture arm has also backed Gridless, a company operating Bitcoin mines powered by renewable energy sources in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, Gridless has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kenyan-volcano-turns-on-lights-in-rural-homes-with-jack-dorseys-bitcoin-mining-support.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">found an innovative way</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to power its operations and bring electricity to rural homes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Located near Hell’s Gate National Park, it has set up shop at the site of an extinct volcano, where the company utilizes a mobile container equipped with solar power and energy from a nearby geothermal site. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gridless operates six mines across Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, all powered by a combination of renewable energy sources. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin mining has faced criticism due to its energy consumption. However, when coupled with renewable energy sources, it can help unlock trapped renewable power and incentivize increased production.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers, utilizing excess power from renewable sources and providing financial incentives for further development.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a report from </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/hong-kong-bitcoin-btc-ether-eth-etf-launches-to-test-crypto-hub-ambition?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Bosera-HashKey Capital spot ETFs </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">are scheduled</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to begin trading on April 30.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-sfc-approves-spot-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-as-market-rebounds.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">granted approval to</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> several fund managers</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to offer these ETFs </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in a bid</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to establish itself as a hub for digital assets by introducing a range of cryptocurrency ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chinese asset managers are also preparing for the introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, drawing comparisons to the highly successful three-month-old US Bitcoin funds that have amassed an impressive $56 billion in assets to date.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chinese Investors Might Show Interest in Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Potential sources of demand for Hong Kong&#8217;s spot crypto ETFs include Chinese wealth invested in the city, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as well as</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Asia-Pacific crypto exchanges and market makers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Rebecca Sin estimates </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that these</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> funds could accumulate $1 billion in assets under management over the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US-based Bitcoin funds offered by major players like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have sparked global interest and attracted significant investment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the prospective Hong Kong issuers, including Harvest Global Investments Ltd. and a partnership between </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">HashKey </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Capital Ltd. and Bosera Asset Management (International) Co., may lack the same level of recognition. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Roger Li, co-founder of One Satoshi, a Hong Kong-based chain of stores offering cash-to-crypto conversions, told Bloomberthat expectations for </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ETF demand should be adjusted</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> considering the city&#8217;s smaller financial sector.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly allowed ETFs </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">investing</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> directly in Bitcoin earlier this year but remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies due to market volatility and past incidents of fraud. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approving ETFs for Ether, the second-largest digital asset, will likely present additional challenges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In contrast, Hong Kong has given initial approval for </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">spot-Bitcoin</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and Ether ETFs, with the added distinction that the HashKey Capital and Bosera offerings will utilize an in-kind subscription and redemption mechanism. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This mechanism allows for the direct exchange of underlying assets for ETF units, offering greater efficiency and arbitrage opportunities compared to the cash redemption model employed by US funds.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hong Kong Offers Futures-Based ETFs</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The city already permits crypto futures-based ETFs, and a framework for stablecoins is also in development. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The success of Hong Kong as a crypto hub remains uncertain, but the ETF launches benefit from Bitcoin&#8217;s impressive rally over the past year, attracting significant interest from Bitcoin holders. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, it will take time for the virtual asset ETF infrastructure </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to fully develop</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, opening the door for more participants, increased liquidity, and improved market conditions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As digital assets continue to gain popularity in China, with a mixed outlook for stocks and a weak real estate sector, the demand for cryptocurrencies remains strong. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, crypto trading is prohibited on the mainland, leading to underground activity, and the upcoming fund launches in Hong Kong are likely to be beyond the reach of Chinese investors accessing Hong Kong ETFs through specific programs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto betting app <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinpoker">CoinPoker</a> has announced it has removed all withdrawal fees on its platform, with only blockchain network fees now applying when users cash out their winnings.</p>
<p>This puts CoinPoker in line with other online gambling sites, such as Rollbit, and it could end up being something that helps the newer site gain more market share over time.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case when CoinPoker offers many of the features provided by sites such as Rollbit, while also adding several more unique propositions, such as poker games against human opponents.</p>
<p>And given that the removal of withdrawal fees comes at a time when gambling coins such as Rollbit (RLB) have been performing well, its implementation could help CoinPoker&#8217;s own CHP token post some gains.</p>
<h2>Crypto Betting App CoinPoker Follows Rollbit With Zero Withdrawal Fees Trend</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Announcing the new policy yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinPoker_OFF/status/1782807509528420829">CoinPoker&#8217;s official X account explained</a> that &#8220;all cashout fees have been eliminated on CoinPoker&#8221; and that only &#8220;the standard network transaction fees will apply&#8221; to customer withdrawals.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4e2.png" alt="📢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We are pleased to inform you that all cashout fees have been eliminated on CoinPoker. </p>

<p>&mdash; CoinPoker (@CoinPoker_OFF) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinPoker_OFF/status/1782807509528420829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>CoinPoker <a href="https://coinpoker.com/deposits-and-withdrawals/#content_2">had previously applied &#8220;nominal fees&#8221; to withdrawals</a>, in order to help fund the stability and security of its site.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s now able to ensure security without taking withdrawal fees, a move that&#8217;s likely to help the site grow its already expanding user base.</p>
<p>SimilarWeb currently <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/coinpoker.com/">ranks it 90th globally in the poker category</a>, with the site having risen 14 places between February and March.</p>
<p>It could continue rising up the rankings following this announcement, with CoinPoker arguably providing a stronger user experience than many of its rivals.</p>
<p>For instance, while it offers an online casino much like rivals such as Rollbit, its poker section also covers games against other human players.</p>
<p>This has particularly come to the fore in its Crypto Series of Poker (CSOP) tournament, which <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-poker-site-coinpoker-launches-1000000-guaranteed-tournament-series-will-chp-gamblefi-token-explode.htm">it launched this month</a> and which is offering a guaranteed prize pool of at least $1 million.</p>
<p>This tournament saw celebrity poker player <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-whales-bet-300k-usdt-on-a-crazy-hand-of-poker-at-coinpoker.htm">Tony G win just over $300,000 in a single game</a> over the weekend, while it also saw the same player win the largest ever prize pot recorded in online poker in February 2022, at $7.7 million.</p>
<h2>Poker Tokens Show Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Combined with the new removal of withdrawal fees, CoinPoker&#8217;s status as the best place on the Internet for crypto-friendly poker should help it bite into the market share of sites such as Rollbit.</p>
<p>In turn, it should also boost the price of CoinPoker&#8217;s native token, CHP.</p>
<p>The latter is up by 1% in the past 24 hours, with buyers likely responding to yesterday&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>At $0.05848, it has gained by 5% in the past fortnight, although it remains down by 43% in a year.</p>
<p>Yet this decline means that the coin is now trading at a good discount, and with CoinPoker expanding consistently, it may only be a matter of time before CHP posts some strong gains.</p>

<p>It could end up following in the footsteps of Rollbit&#8217;s own coin, RLB, which has recorded a 670% increase in the last 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/floki-inu/">Floki price</a> has surged by 15% today, reaching $0.0001968 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole posts a 1% gain in 24 hours.</p>
<p>FLOKI has now gained by an impressive 40% in a week, and while the meme token remains down by 15% in a month, it has also increased by 600% in the past year.</p>
<p>These figures make Floki Inu one of the best-performing major meme coins of this period, with its gains over the past few days coming after <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/floki-now-listed-on-europes-leading-neobank-revolut-302125119.html">Revolut announced it would be listing the FLOKI token</a>.</p>
<p>And with the wider market improving today after a difficult couple of weeks, we could see more Floki price gains very soon.</p>
<h2>Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Suddenly Spikes Up 15% – Are Whales Buying?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FLOKI&#8217;s indicators remain in a very bullish position, signalling that the coin could continue to post gains in the near term.</p>
<p>Its 30-day average (orange) is still rising further beyond the 200-day average (blue), providing a clear sign that the token remains in a growth phase.</p>
<figure id="attachment_202927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-202927" style="width: 4310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-202927" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart.png" alt="Floki price chart." width="4310" height="2396" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart.png 4310w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart-300x167.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart-1024x569.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart-768x427.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart-1536x854.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart-2048x1139.png 2048w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24090608/1713949563-floki-price-chart-150x83.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4310px) 100vw, 4310px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-202927" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, FLOKI&#8217;s RSI is hanging around the 60 mark, where it could easily rise again once the past hour&#8217;s dip has played out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also bullish that the coin&#8217;s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are rising in parallel, with $0.00020 being the key resistance to watch.</p>
<p>If Floki can break through this price, we could certainly see more buyers entering its market and pushing its price up further.</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven&#8217;t been any recent signs of big transfers involving whales, yet the fact that FLOKI&#8217;s volume has risen from $100 million over the weekend to nearly $500 million today would certainly suggest that traders are stocking up on the coin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FLOKI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FLOKI</a> just got listed on Revolut, the biggest neobank and retail trading app in Europe!</p>
<p>This listing will make <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a> accessible to <a href="https://twitter.com/RevolutApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RevolutApp</a>&#39;s 40 million+ users in 150+ countries who will be able to buy FLOKI with 25+ fiat currencies including GBP, EUR, USD and more.</p>

<p>&mdash; FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1782511586248196453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Driving interest in Floki has been the aforementioned announcement that Revolut has added support for the token, meaning that around 40 million of the fintech&#8217;s customers could potentially become FLOKI holders.</p>
<p>Not only is this a vote of confidence in the meme coin, but it offers a reminder that it could see further listings in the near future, with Coinbase (for example) yet to add the token.</p>
<p>And seeing as how the wider market is expecting an improvement in macroeconomic conditions later in the year (e.g. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-cut-rates-september-maybe-once-more-this-year-2024-04-18/">rate cuts</a>), the Floki price could continue to rise as positivity increases.</p>
<p>It may reach $0.00025 by the end of summer, before breaking its record high ($0.0003365) in the final quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Other High-Potential Meme Tokens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FLOKI looks very good at the moment, but it isn&#8217;t the only growing meme token that could post some very big gains in the near future.</p>
<p>There are also various recently launched meme coins that are showing strong potential, with several presale tokens generating lots of momentum as they get ready to list.</p>
<p><span>One of the hottest of these is </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/slothana">Slothana (SLOTH)</a>, <span>a Solana-based cryptocurrency that has raised more than $10 million in its soon-to-be-closing sale.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The sale will end in five days, at which point the coin will hold its airdrop and list on trading platforms.</p>
<p>Given that it has raised over $10 million in a matter of weeks, its listings could see it post some very big gains.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this will be helped by the fact that it&#8217;s launching at a time when demand for Solana-based <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins</a> is still high, with certain tokens (e.g. DogWifHat) enjoying eye-watering returns in recent months.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, Slothana has already done a good job in building a strong online community, with its</span> <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://twitter.com/SlothanaCoin">official X account now having more than 24,000 followers</a>.</p>
<p>Because meme tokens often live or die by the health of their communities, Slothana&#8217;s ability to generate a following so quickly is a good sign for its future.</p>

<p>Investors can join its sale at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/slothana">the Slothana website</a>, where they can buy the token at a rate of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH.</p>
<p>This works out at about $0.0156 per token, a price that could end up seeming very cheap once the token lists in less than a week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ECB executive board member wants Apple to change how iPhone payments work to support a potential digital euro. He claims the tech giant&#8217;s current system may not support offline payments for any European Central Bank digital currency.</p>
<p>The member, Piero Cipollone, outlined his concerns <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.letter240419_Vestager~8f8210db09.en.pdf">in a letter</a> to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager dated April 19.</p>
<p>“Apple’s proposed commitments would not give third parties full access to the secure element (SE), but only allow for the usage of Host Card Emulation (HCE),” he said. For clarification, a secure element (SE) is a specialized chip engineered for enhanced security. It functions like a miniature safe within a device, commonly present in smartphones, tablets, and certain credit cards.</p>
<p>Also, he thinks Apple&#8217;s proposal may not offer the same level of authentication and transaction speed as ApplePay.</p>
<p>Apple didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.</p>
<h2>Limited NFC Access on iPhones Creates Friction for Potential Digital Euro</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cipollone added that currently, Apple&#8217;s proposals don&#8217;t ensure a fair level playing field for third-party payment solutions. This is especially true for in-store payments with iPhones. Were these proposals to be applied to a potential digital euro, they wouldn&#8217;t guarantee user-friendly payments on iPhone, the economist said.</p>
<p>He also noted certain limitations with the EU&#8217;s recent antitrust investigation into Apple. It doesn&#8217;t address limited access to near-field communication (NFC) technology in various payment situations, including person-to-person payments, he said.</p>
<p>“We note that this use case is crucial for the digital euro,” he said.</p>
<h2>ECB Pushes for Open Access to Phone Security Chips for Digital Euro</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the economist, the proposed digital euro regulation requires device manufacturers and electronic communication service providers to offer fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory access to the secure element in their devices.</p>
<p>He said this access should be unrestricted and not reliant on other mobile operating system applications. This ensures that digital euro payments on mobile devices are user-friendly.</p>
<p>The European Commission has released draft laws outlining the groundwork for a potential digital euro. This includes establishing basic criteria and preparing necessary legislation for potential issuance.</p>
<p>In late 2023, the ECB initiated a two-year preparatory phase for the digital euro. This phase involves finalizing regulations, selecting private-sector collaborators, and conducting testing and experimentation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span>Wednesday, April 24, 2024</span></i><span> &#8211; Newcomer meme coin and multi-chain good boy </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span> ($DOGEVERSE) has rammed through its soft cap target ahead of schedule, taking in over $10 million along the way, in a presale that’s shaking up the saturated world of meme coins. </span></p>
<p><span>The latest in crypto’s long line of Shiba Inu-inspired funny tokens has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see its cross-chain capabilities as a hint of what tomorrow’s meme coins will look like. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently priced at $0.000301 and due to rise in just under two days, </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span> has already sold out its soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launch. </span></p>
<p><span>A meaty $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated for the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team’s initial expectation of a 6-day first round.  </span></p>
<p><span>Fast forward one fortnight and </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span> has already moved onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens will be sold to the public across five remaining rounds that close on June 11. </span></p>
<p><span>The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used for liquidity and buy-back funds.</span></p>
<p><span>Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards. </span></p>
<p><span>The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span>But why exactly is everybody lapping up </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span>?</span></p>

<h2><span>Dogeverse: The First Multi-Chain Good Boy</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>It all started with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. His adorable avatar didn’t need much selling because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!) </span></p>
<p><span>Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but none of them are inherently multi-chain. </span></p>
<p><span>Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, and as another proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, it eats up a lot of electricity to validate blocks and mine DOGE. </span></p>
<p><span>Since then, Dogecoin’s competitors have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span> is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism. It is already live on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain,  Polygon, Base and Avalanche. A Solana rollout is planned soon. </span></p>
<p><span>At the center of the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span> is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners. </span></p>

<h2><span>Dogeverse, The Halving, Onwards</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>As any holder will tell you, meme coins are some of crypto’s most volatile investments. This is because they have a tendency to exaggerate broader market-wide price movements. </span></p>
<p><span>This means, for instance, that on days when investors are feeling risky and pumping Bitcoin, meme coins can often be found rallying harder. Conversely, a risk-off day in crypto may manifest itself in spiraling meme coin prices. </span></p>
<p><span>Investors should be aware then, that meme coin performance is linked to crypto’s perpetual news cycle. That said, two immediate price drivers will have a strong relationship to Cosmo’s multi-chain </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The first is last Saturday’s Bitcoin halving. The halving slashes Bitcoin mining rewards in half, effectively choking the issuance of new BTC and helping drive prices higher. Halvings have historically catalyzed bull runs, and already we can see Bitcoin has risen steadily (3%) since the halving. </span></p>
<p><span>The second is May 23. That’s the SEC’s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for an Ethereum ETF. </span></p>
<p><span>Many analysts see the date as the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto’s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.</span></p>
<p><span>As will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>Dogeverse</span></a><span>.  </span></p>
<p><span>So Cosmo is clean and green, with staking and seamless multi-chain fun. What’s not to love about crypto’s new hyper-jumping pupper?</span></p>
<p><span>Join the presale over on </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/"><span>the Dogeverse website</span></a><span> before the price rises in under two days. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The President of Indonesia Joko Widodo has raised concerns over the use of cryptocurrencies in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-changpeng-zhao-faces-3-years-prison-money-laundering.htm">money laundering</a>.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/311610/optimizing-seat-at-the-fatf-to-combat-transnational-crimes">report</a> by Antara, President Widodo highlighted the alarming volume of illicit financial flows during his address at the 22nd Anniversary of the National Movement for Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Prevention.</p>
<h2>Indonesia Joins Global Efforts in AML Through FATF</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Indonesia achieved a permanent position in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body combating money laundering and terror financing, following approval from member states at a meeting in Paris on October 25 last year.</p>
<p>This milestone marked the culmination of Indonesia&#8217;s efforts since June 29, 2018, when it first joined the FATF as an observer, steadily working towards becoming the organization&#8217;s 40th member.</p>
<p>Widodo expressed his hope that Indonesia&#8217;s full membership in the FATF would motivate stakeholders to intensify their efforts against money laundering.</p>
<p>He viewed the membership as crucial for enhancing Indonesia&#8217;s economic credibility and improving the global perception of its financial system, which he believes will subsequently attract more investments.</p>
<p>Widodo noted that Indonesia&#8217;s FATF membership would provide support from 39 countries, which could offer expert testimony and evidence in efforts to combat money laundering, including crimes involving crypto.</p>
<p>The importance of vigilance among stakeholders was also emphasized, particularly as money launderers increasingly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-money-laundering-dropped-almost-30-in-2023-chainalysis.htm">exploit</a> crypto markets to obscure their activities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting discussions today as we met with Nordstar and its impressive lineup of portfolio companies including Nothing, Airwallex, and Worldcoin. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Enhancing Legal Frameworks to Combat Money Laundering</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sigid Suseno, a criminal law observer from Padjadjaran University, stressed the importance of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indonesia-australia-authorities-ink-crypto-taxation-deal.htm">country</a> leveraging its FATF membership effectively to curb money laundering and hold offenders accountable.</p>
<p>Suseno called for heightened collaboration among law enforcement agencies to respond to rapidly changing money laundering methods, pointing out that such activities often precede other crimes like drug abuse and terrorism.</p>
<p>Moreover, Suseno emphasized the urgency of implementing the Asset Forfeiture Bill into enforceable law, enabling law enforcers to more effectively trace and seize assets derived from criminal activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, is reportedly launching a $15 million TV commercials across four channels airing NBA playoffs.</p>
<p>The move, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/coinbase-dunks-traditional-payment-methods-15m-nba-ad-spend">reported by the Fox news</a>, is aimed at attracting more sports enthusiast into the crypto space. Symbolized by pizza, these commercials showcase the process pizzas go through, if it was a money in today’s system.</p>
<p>“If pizza worked like this, you wouldn’t like pizza,” the ad narrates.</p>
<p>The news of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-advertises-bitcoin-halving-in-new-commercial.htm">Coinbase commercials</a> hasn’t been reported officially yet. It is set to run three separate ads across four channels telecasting NBA playoffs, starting Wednesday.</p>
<p>The motive to run these ads is to emphasize how complex traditional payments systems are, when compared to cryptos. Two commercials are 30 seconds each and one run for 60 seconds, airing on ESPN, ESPN2, TNT and ABC.</p>
<p>Further, the report added that these ads will run until June 9.</p>
<p>“We’re under the illusion that when we use credit cards or Venmo, things are happening instantly, but they&#8217;re actually just part of very complex plumbing that’s masked by a digital interface,” Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at Coinbase, noted.</p>
<h2>Coinbase’s Pizza Ad Journey</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The pizza, which is being described, will go through several scrutiny and approval stages, per the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=NON0euNOj3k">ad posted on YouTube</a>. The ad throughout mimic traditional credit card transaction, represented by several people taking a bite of the pizza pie.</p>
<p>This basically symbolizes the role of middlemen in traditional finance transactions that take a sizeable portion of commission.</p>
<p>“This is pretty much what happens to your money whenever you spend it or send it,” the narrator says.</p>
<p>At the final stage, the pizza barges into a door marked “surcharge,” indicating the credit card fees. A delivery boy picks up the pizza noting, “we deserve a better system, easier simpler faster. That’s how crypto works.”</p>
<p>“Coinbase is building the future of money to make sure American consumers own their own pie &#8212; and making sure their payment moves at the speed of the internet,” Coinbase’s vice president of engineering, told Fox news.</p>

<p><span>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC/USD)</a> hovers around $66,980, up approximately 1%, attention intensifies on its upward trajectory, potentially surging towards $70,000. Recent developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly the influx of $59.7 million into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs after a period of outflows, signal a shift in sentiment. </span></p>
<p><span>As institutional players like Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC near 300,000 Bitcoins, and additional spot Bitcoin ETFs emerge, the landscape evolves. Amidst these dynamics, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price prediction</a> gains prominence, echoing both market optimism and the ongoing evolution of digital asset investment strategies.</span></p>
<h2>U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Experience Influx; Market Shows Signs of Recovery</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Thirteen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto last communicated about Bitcoin. Recently, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant shift, securing $59.7 million in inflows on Friday after a week of losses. This change hints at a potential market rebound.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s New BIP Editors Aim to Enhance Development Efficiency</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is undergoing significant changes to its Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process with the introduction of five new editors, moving away from the traditional single-editor system previously spearheaded by Luke Dashjr.</p>
<p>This new approach aims to enhance the efficiency of reviewing and integrating proposals, potentially accelerating the development of the cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2><strong>Hong Kong Tests Crypto Hub Ambitions with New Bitcoin ETF Launches</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hong Kong is launching <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/hong-kong-bitcoin-btc-ether-eth-etf-launches-to-test-crypto-hub-ambition?utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">Bitcoin and Ether ETFs</a> to establish itself as a global digital asset hub. This initiative, driven by top Chinese asset managers, aims to rival the United States, where similar funds hold assets worth $56 billion.</p>
<p>The success of Hong Kong’s ETFs depends heavily on local market demand and faces stiff competition from established US brands like BlackRock and Fidelity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF recently secured a record $40 million from financial advisers Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas, marking the largest single investment in the fund. This influx highlights growing confidence among traditional investors, with Bitcoin now comprising 6% and 5% of these firms&#8217; portfolios, respectively.</p>

<p>Despite this significant institutional buy-in, overall public participation in Bitcoin ETFs remains low. Fidelity’s fund, holding over $10 billion, stands as the second-largest but faces a slowdown in demand as evidenced by recent net outflows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>US prosecutors are pushing for a 3-year prison sentence for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who is set to be sentenced on April 30 in Seattle.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-changpeng-zhao-faces-3-years-prison-money-laundering.htm">Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Faces 3-Year Prison Sentence for Money Laundering</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US prosecutors are seeking a 3-year prison term for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, per a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570.78.0.pdf"><span>Tuesday court filing</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Zhao is scheduled for sentencing on April 30 in Seattle, having <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm"><span>pleaded guilty</span></a> in November to breaching US anti-money laundering laws. He stepped down from his role as CEO at the crypto exchange, yet retains majority ownership. As part of the agreement, he agreed to a $50m fine, while the company offered to pay $4.3b in fines and compensation.</p>
<p>“Given the magnitude of Zhao’s willful violation of US law and its consequences, an above-Guidelines sentence of 36 months is warranted,” US prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Binance didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.</p>
<h2>Prosecutors Push for Harsher Punishment for Crypto Mogul&#8217;s Crimes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Zhao was initially set to face up to 18 months in prison, a condition he accepted without appeal. In November, he was released on a $175m bail while awaiting sentencing for banking law breaches. Still, he was required to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-barred-from-travel-by-us-judge.htm"><span>adhere to travel restrictions within the US</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Now, prosecutors want a more severe penalty for him than what the federal sentencing guidelines recommend.</p>
<p>“Zhao reaped vast rewards for his violation of US law,&#8221; the filing read. &#8220;And the price of that violation must be significant to effectively punish Zhao for his criminal acts and to deter others who are tempted to build fortunes and business empires by breaking US law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim that Zhao neglected to establish a robust anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance. This allegedly enabled illicit actors to exploit the exchange. Further, the actors used Binance for activities like operating mixing services to conceal crypto origins.</p>
<p>Moreover, Binance is said to have facilitated Iranian customers&#8217; transactions with US customers. This move undermined US sanctions against Iran and jeopardized exchange liquidity.</p>
<h2>Operational Shortcomings and Reporting Failures</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In February, a settlement addressed significant operational deficiencies found within Binance. Notably, this included the platform&#8217;s failure to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions linked to designated terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, al Qaeda, and ISIS.</p>
<p>Additionally, Binance faced allegations of facilitating <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-judge-approves-binances-4-3-billion-plea-deal-can-bull-market-resume-now.htm"><span>transactions related to child sexual abuse materials</span></a> and proceeds from ransomware activities.</p>
<p>Despite facing legal obstacles, Zhao&#8217;s fortune has experienced significant growth over the past year, surging by nearly $10b, per the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/zhao-changpeng/"><span>Bloomberg Billionaires Index</span></a>. Currently, his wealth exceeds $42b, making him the 29th wealthiest individual worldwide, according to the index.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Renowned crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes has shared his insights on the macroeconomic landscape, predicting a strengthening trend that could further propel </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin&#8217;s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ascent. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a <a href="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/left-curve-ef2e1e187027">recent blog post</a>, Hayes highlighted the looming threat of a sovereign debt bubble on the horizon, which may intensify the macro setup favoring cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hayes said that there is a prevailing narrative gaining traction in </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">both</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> retail and institutional investing circles, pointing to major economic blocs like the US, China, the European Union (EU), and Japan debasing their currencies </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as a means</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to deleverage their </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">governments&#8217;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> balance sheets.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This narrative has spurred interest in crypto-derivative products, such as US Bitcoin ETFs, as traditional finance seeks to preserve wealth against the erosion of fiat currencies.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Market to Continue Bullish Trajectory</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">As Bitcoin experienced a period of weakness due to US tax payments on April 15 and the Bitcoin halving, Hayes said the market will continue its bullish trajectory, driving prices higher.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hayes emphasized that </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in markets,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the strategies and factors that led to previous successes often differ from those that will drive future gains.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, he noted that the macro setup responsible for the fiat liquidity surge that fueled </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin&#8217;s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> remarkable ascent will only grow more pronounced as the sovereign debt bubble approaches its bursting point.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the global financial landscape evolves, Hayes </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">urged caution</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> against premature profit-taking and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">encourages</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> investors to embrace the ongoing market momentum.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He advocated existing in the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8220;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Left Curve,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8221; </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a mindset focused on seizing opportunities and adding to winning positions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hayes added that he expects the bull market to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">continue,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and the potential for Bitcoin to reach even higher price levels, far beyond its current position. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;H</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">owever, the macro setup that created the fiat liquidity surge that powered </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin’s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ascent will only get more pronounced as the sovereign debt bubble begins to burst</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Stagnates as ETF Inflows Slow Down</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The price of Bitcoin has remained within the $66,000 range as of late amid slowing spot ETF inflows. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sosovalue.xyz/assets/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SoSoValue</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF yesterday, April 23, was $31.6354 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net outflow of $66.8838 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The single-day net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was $37.9233 million, and the current total historical net inflow of IBIT reached $15.479 billion.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German security technology group Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) is partnering with the Central Bank of Mauritania to explore the design and development of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a> dubbed ‘digital Ouguiya.’</p>
<p>The partners <a href="https://www.gi-de.com/en/group/press/press-releases/the-central-bank-of-mauritania-commissions-g-d-to-design-a-digital-currency">signed a deal</a> during the World Bank Group’s Spring Meetings held this month in Washington. Wolfram Seidemann, CEO of G+D Currency Technology, and Mohamed Lemine Ould Dhehby, governor of the Banque Centrale de Mauritanie inked a deal to work together in investigating the creation of a CBDC.</p>
<p>The collaboration focuses mainly on the potential advantages of a digital Mauritanian Ouguiya for the nation’s economy and society.</p>
<p>The governor noted that the central bank is “strategically positioned” for the potential launch of its digital currency.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Through the exploratory work we have now agreed, we are expanding our knowledge base, skills and experience. G+D&#8217;s expertise in this innovative, rapidly developing field will help us to bring it to life for the benefit of the whole country.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>G+D’s Role in CBDC Development</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per the company’s release on Tuesday, G+D will offer technical solution for initial testing of CBDC use cases. Additionally, it would help the central bank in defining the requirements for a digital Ouguiya.</p>
<p>“The digital Ouguiya is part of the digital transformation agenda for the entire country,” Seidemann said in the statement. “It is of critical importance for economic and social progress.”</p>
<p>G+D has conducted research into CBDC adoption for several jurisdictions including Brazil, Ghana and Eswatini. For instance, G+D’s CBDC pilot with the Bank of Ghana proved a successful integration of financial intermediaries. It facilitated seamless interoperability and enhanced user experience capabilities.</p>
<p>According to Seidemann, G+D provides expertise on public currency technology, cryptology, smart cards, and digital and mobile payments to central banks conducting research on and implementing CBDCs. One of the solutions – G+D Filia – supports central banks in operating CBDCs nationally.</p>
<p>As far Mauritania is concerned, the evaluation of a CBDC is important for consolidating macroeconomic stability and improving the sustainability of Mauritania&#8217;s economic growth.</p>

Gox-era Bitcoin in the coming weeks could unsettle the market and exert negative price pressure on Bitcoin, according to analysts at K33 Research.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this week, some creditors of the now-defunct Mt. Gox crypto exchange </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mt-gox-trustee-reveals-bitcoin-and-fiat-repayment-for-creditors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shared updates on their claims</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> on Reddit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These updates included information about the amount of cryptocurrency and fiat owed to the creditors</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, as well as</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> completed repayment dates.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mt. Gox Creditors Could Receive Payments Next Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new updates suggest that creditors might start receiving their Bitcoin as soon as next month, as </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">noted by</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> K33 Research analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde in an April 23 market note.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The outstanding debt to Mt. Gox&#8217;s 127,000 creditors amounts to over $9.4 billion in Bitcoin, $72 million in Bitcoin Cash, and $445.8 million (69 billion Japanese yen).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helseth and Lunde cautioned that </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the release of</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Bitcoin may not necessarily result in immediate selling pressure.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, they emphasized that the substantial &#8220;overhang&#8221; of 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH could &#8220;spook the market.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">currently</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> trading at just over $66,700, with recent volatility attributed to changing tensions in the Middle East and the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> halving that occurred on April 20.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Mt. Gox creditors have been eagerly awaiting the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">return</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of their funds for over a decade since the exchange&#8217;s collapse in February 2014 due to a series of undetected hacks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In January, the Mt. Gox trustee </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">initiated contact with</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> creditors to verify their identities and the crypto exchange accounts that </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">would be used</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for repaying the owed Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some creditors had already begun receiving Japanese yen repayments by December of last year, and further fiat transfers </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were reported</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in March, according to the K33 report.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the final repayment deadline for base repayments, early lump-sum repayments, and intermediate repayments </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is currently set</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for October 31, 2024, it remains subject to potential changes.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Surges After Halving</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Bitcoin did not immediately react to the much-anticipated halving event, the leading cryptocurrency has since registered some gains. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While some analysts, including JPMorgan, have cautioned about a potential further price slide following this quadrennial event, the overall consensus remains bullish in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Just recently, Bitwise said that while the month immediately following the halving typically sees a modest drop in price, the subsequent year often </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/asset-manager-bitwise-says-market-underestimates-long-term-impact-of-halving.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">witnesses exponential gains</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The asset manager noted that following the 2012 halving, Bitcoin experienced a meager 9% increase in the month post-halving, only to skyrocket by a staggering 8,839% over the following year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similar patterns </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were observed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with Bitcoin’s price surging significantly in the year following each event.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Likewise, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has recently said that Bitcoin may experience some selling pressure in the lead-up to the highly anticipated halving event, but the long-term </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-long-term-outlook-remains-bullish-despite-selling-pressure-ahead-of-halving-crypto-com-ceo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">outlook remains bullish</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia and Australia’s taxation authorities on Monday signed a pact in Jakarta to establish a crypto information-sharing arrangement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this agreement, <a href="https://indonesia.embassy.gov.au/jakt/MR24_033.html">announced Tuesday</a>, is to improve identifying assets potentially subject to taxation in either nation. It is also meant to facilitate a more efficient exchange of crypto-related data and information between the tax authorities. Further, it addresses adherence to tax responsibilities.</p>
<p>According to Mekar Satria Utama, a director at the Indonesian Directorate General of Taxes (DGT), the MoU underscores the importance of innovation and collaboration amongst tax authorities. This approach is crucial to keep pace with the rapid advancements in the global landscape of financial technologies, he added.</p>
<p>“While crypto assets are relatively new, the need to ensure equitable taxation remains essential to promote economic growth and provide revenue for crucial public investments in areas like infrastructure, education and healthcare,” Utama said.</p>
<h2>ATO-DGT Collaboration Sets New Standards</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A history of collaboration exists between the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the Indonesian DGT. This partnership has included various DGT priorities. It includes aspects like the digitization of taxpayer services through the introduction of a virtual tax assistant.</p>
<p>Additionally, the two entities have worked together on the implementation of value-added tax (VAT) for digital goods and services.</p>
<h2>Regulations and Information Sharing Take Center Stage</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/giant-indonesian-market-gets-first-regulated-local-crypto-ex-5164.htm"><span>Indonesia has been proactively formulating regulations</span></a> for the crypto sector. It has also fostered collaborations with foreign countries and international entities to craft a strong crypto framework.</p>
<p>Spearheading these initiatives is Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK), which has been collaborating with financial regulators in Malaysia, Singapore, and Dubai to lay down a solid groundwork for crypto policy.</p>
<p>Per a recent regulation, crypto firms intending to operate in Indonesia must undergo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-firms-regulatory-sandbox-evaluation-licensing-indonesia.htm"><span>assessment within a regulatory sandbox</span></a> before obtaining licensing, effective from Jan. 2025. This regulatory adjustment coincides with the transition of oversight of the crypto sector to the Financial Services Authority (OJK).</p>
<p>Entities providing cryptocurrency services in Indonesia without undergoing sandbox assessment will be considered to be operating unlawfully.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Australia is among numerous countries engaged in cooperation with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a framework for the automatic exchange of information regarding crypto-assets, known as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-regulation-news-weekly-digest-major-nations-commit-to-crypto-tax-reporting-standard-and-eu-issues-draft-stablecoin-guidelines.htm"><span>Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework</span></a> (CARF).</p>
<p>The objective is to establish a uniform method for taxing cryptocurrencies globally. Although not specifically a bilateral tax treaty, this collaboration seeks to enhance tax transparency and mitigate tax evasion concerning crypto profits.</p>
