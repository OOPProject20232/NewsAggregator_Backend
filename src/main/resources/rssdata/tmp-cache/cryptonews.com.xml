										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ZKasino, a blockchain-based gambling project, has found itself at the center of a heated controversy after it abruptly shifted $33 million worth of investor and user funds to the staking protocol Lido. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move deviated from the project&#8217;s initial plan to return the funds to its users.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://zkasino.medium.com/the-zkasino-network-goes-live-f39dfa1f740a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">blog post on April 20</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, ZKasino announced the launch of its network. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over 10,000 users had bridged a total of 10,515 Ether (ETH) to the network, hoping to acquire the ZKasino (ZKAS) token. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, instead of returning the ETH as promised, ZKasino stated that it had made changes to its original plan. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bridged ETH was converted to ZKAS at a discounted rate of $0.055, subject to a 15-month vesting schedule.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ZKasino Backtracks On Promise to Return ETH</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">ZKasino justified these changes as a means to facilitate a smooth transition, as its chain did not utilize ETH. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Users also noticed that the project had altered the wording on its website, removing the statement guaranteeing the return of the ETH.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Concerns escalated further when an on-chain transfer revealed that ZKasino had moved all 10,515 ETH from its users into the Lido staking protocol. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On social media platform X, numerous posts from purported ZKasino users who had invested in the project now accuse it of being an exit scam. </span></p>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Further controversy emerged when venture capital firm Big Brain claimed, in an April 21st X post, that ZKasino appeared to be fraudulent. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Previously, ZKasino had announced on X that it had secured a Series A investment round at a valuation of $350 million, with support from crypto exchange MEXC and venture firm Big Brain Holdings, among others. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, MEXC distanced itself from the project, stating that it was just one of the investors and that ZKasino&#8217;s behavior had nothing to do with them.</span></p>

<p><span>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) demonstrates robust performance, with a notable price surge to $66,270, an uplift of approximately 2.50%. This positive momentum places Bitcoin&#8217;s trading dynamics in the spotlight, crucial for those monitoring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin price predictions</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>As it surpasses the pivotal $64,853 mark, the digital currency may be poised for further gains, with key resistance levels emerging that could test the resilience of this uptrend. This scenario presents an interesting phase in Bitcoin&#8217;s market trajectory, making it a critical moment for investors and analysts alike.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Currency Stability Amid Global Policy Shifts and Geopolitical Developments</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the early hours of Asian trading, the euro and yen have held steady, while the <a href="https://www.dimsumdaily.hk/global-currencies-hold-steady-amid-policy-reviews-and-geopolitical-shifts/">US dollar remains near recent highs</a>, influenced by recent Federal Reserve statements and higher-than-expected inflation data. Attention is now turning to the Bank of Japan&#8217;s policy review as the yen hovers near a 34-year low against the dollar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the easing of Middle East tensions has reduced market volatility.</p>

<p>During the International Monetary Fund meetings, discussions reinforced the dollar&#8217;s dominance, affecting global currency dynamics. Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent &#8220;halving&#8221; event could alter its supply and potentially impact its price trend.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Miners Thrive as Runes Debut Skyrockets Transaction Fees</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin miners are experiencing a significant windfall due to the introduction of the Runes protocol, which has pushed transaction fees to unprecedented levels, offsetting the decreased block rewards post-halving.</p>
<p>On April 20, transaction fees soared to $127.97, contributing to a record <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/21/bitcoin-miners-reap-windfall-as-runes-debut-sends-transaction-fees-to-record-highs/">mining revenue of $107.8 million</a>. The Runes protocol, enabling token creation directly on Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, has led to the production and exchange listing of hundreds of tokens.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The launch of Casey Rodarmor&#39;s Runes, right at the Bitcoin halving, spurred a flurry of transactions that sent fee rates and miner revenue to records, dramatically altering the conversation over network security <a href="https://twitter.com/Liqquidity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@liqquidity</a> reports <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MARA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MARA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RIOT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$RIOT</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CORZ&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CORZ</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HUT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$HUT</a> <a href="https://t.co/LLgqjLGu4O">https://t.co/LLgqjLGu4O</a></p>

<p>Despite these gains, the high fees and resulting network congestion raise concerns. Critics emphasize the necessity of scalable solutions like the Lightning Network.

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Futures Launch Sees High Demand on Brazil&#8217;s B3 Exchange</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On its debut, Bitcoin futures trading on Brazil&#8217;s B3 exchange captured significant interest, with 7,400 contracts exchanged and orders peaking at 111,000. Marcos Skistymas, B3&#8217;s Listed Products Director, highlighted the importance of offering these futures to local investors as a hedge against Bitcoin&#8217;s price volatility.</p>
<p>This initiative follows the approval from Brazil&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) and complements B3&#8217;s existing suite of 14 cryptocurrency ETFs.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Each futures contract, denominated in Brazilian reais, represents 0.1 BTC and settles financially using the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price Index.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand will restrict access to unauthorized crypto platforms due to concerns of law enforcement effectiveness and money laundering risks.</p>
<p>According to a Friday <span>announcement</span>, the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) will <a href="https://www.sec.or.th/TH/Pages/News_Detail.aspx?SECID=10732&amp;fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0BMQABHfcwra1QtmXgckCBiPpfgG5OKOrRxpWY8tSF13jeQDi2qDks1El5_GsYKQ_aem_ASNhM3cWgGaZHUMVDkCdGUnbDIL2U3wt3oc9MbFlXn_BLI5zhNoT1-6f0q6k7mGKLVc">refer the matter to the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society</a> (MDES) for further action. MDES will then initiate the appropriate legal process, potentially including a court petition.</p>
<p>The regulator cited the examples of India and the Philippines. Both countries have restricted access to unauthorized cryptocurrency platforms.</p>
<p>Recognizing potential inconvenience to users, the SEC said will allow a grace period for users to manage their accounts before service termination. However, it urged users to promptly withdraw their assets from such platforms.</p>
<h2>Thailand SEC Tightens Grip on Crypto Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Previously, the SEC said it pursued legal action against unauthorized digital asset businesses such as Binance and Bybit. The regulator further cautioned the public against engaging with unlicensed digital asset businesses. These businesses lack legal protections, potentially exposing investors to financial risks.</p>
<p>To ensure a safe environment, the SEC encouraged crypto investors to consult the <a href="https://market.sec.or.th/public/idisc/th/InvestorAlert"><span>official list of licensed operators</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>The Thailand Digital Asset Association <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-surge-could-attract-fraudsters-thai-digital-asset-association.htm"><span>issued a recent warning to Thai users</span></a>, highlighting the potential for increased cyberattacks due to the recent uptrend in crypto prices.</p>
<p>“Everyone expects the cryptocurrency market to be on a bull run this year, thanks mainly to the launch of spot Bitcoin exchanged-traded funds and the halving of Bitcoin,” said the association’s director Suppakrit Boonsat.</p>
<h2>Thailand to Address Online Fraud in P2P Crypto Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Separately, Thai state authorities emphasized the need for regulations <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/thailand-authorities-seek-regulations-on-crypto-p2p-activities.htm#:~:text=Crypto%20P2P%20Regulation%20in%20Thailand,investigate%20crypto%2Drelated%20online%20scams."><span>governing peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transactions</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p>Minister Prasert Jantararuangthong specifically called upon regulators to develop and implement a framework that addresses P2P crypto purchases and sales, aiming to mitigate the risks of online fraud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A group of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> enthusiasts based in Switzerland is making a renewed effort to convince the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to include Bitcoin in its reserves. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Their plan involves launching a petition to initiate a referendum that would seek to amend the country&#8217;s constitution, which will require gathering over 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yves Bennaïm, the founder and chairman of 2B4CH, a non-profit think tank leading the campaign, believes that adding Bitcoin to the SNB&#8217;s reserves would safeguard Switzerland&#8217;s &#8220;sovereignty and neutrality&#8221; in an increasingly uncertain global landscape, he told </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/nun-kommt-die-volksinitiative-welche-die-nationalbank-zum-kauf-von-bitcoin-verpflichten-will-ld.1827256" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to the Swiss news outlet Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2B4CH Finalizing Preparations for the Necessary Documents</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bennaïm said that they are finalizing the organizational preparations for the committee and the necessary documents to be submitted to the State Chancellery.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the process is not without its challenges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Swiss constitution stipulates that a referendum can only be held if at least 100,000 Swiss citizens sign a petition within 18 months. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This requirement posed difficulties for 2B4CH during their first attempt in October 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At that time, they launched the &#8220;Bitcoin Initiative&#8221; with the goal of amending Article 99-3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to include Bitcoin as a reserve currency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a population of 8.77 million in Switzerland, approximately 1.15% of the locals need to support the petition by signing it. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin-focused trading platform Bitcoin Suisse, who is assisting Bennaïm in this initiative, believes that including Bitcoin in the SNB&#8217;s reserves would signify Switzerland&#8217;s independence from the European Central Bank and enhance its neutrality.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meisser to Discuss Benefits of Adding Bitcoin to Balance Sheet</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meisser will have an opportunity to present the benefits of adding Bitcoin to the SNB&#8217;s balance sheet during a meeting scheduled for April 26. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, he will only have three minutes to make his case. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the past, Meisser attempted to persuade the central bank to allocate 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) each month to Bitcoin as an alternative to German government bonds in March 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unfortunately, SNB Chair Thomas Jordan reportedly stated in April 2022 that Bitcoin did not meet the requirements to be considered a reserve currency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meisser argues that Switzerland would currently be 30 billion Swiss francs ($32.9 billion) richer if the central bank had followed his suggestion in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also warns that delaying the move could result in other central banks acquiring Bitcoin at significantly higher prices, leaving Switzerland at a disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The NZZ article discussing the petition has garnered support from Joana Cotar, a German politician and Bitcoin activist who strongly opposes a European Union-backed digital currency. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>China’s blanket ban on crypto mining, followed a mass exodus of miners to various African nations including Angola.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese Embassy in Angola has reminded its nationals on Angola’s recent prohibition of all <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-mining/">crypto mining</a> activities. The authority issued firm warning, emphasizing severe penalties to those who violate the law.</p>
<p>The Angolan parliament passed a bill early this year on the “Prohibition of Cryptocurrency and Other Virtual Asset Mining,” which became effective on April 10. Under this law, any form of crypto mining is termed as a ‘criminal’ offence.</p>
<p>As for the legal consequences, possession of information or any crypto mining-related equipment will lead to 1-5 years in jail. Additionally, the <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hXlYEkLGyjonzM3yGRGkqg">Chinese Embassy note</a>, read that the government would confiscate the equipment used for mining purposes.</p>
<p>“Mining cryptocurrencies by yourself or through others Currency and other virtual assets, or connecting such mining equipment to the national power system, will be sentenced to 3 to 12 years in prison,” it warned.</p>
<p>Violators that utilize power facility license to engage in crypto mining activities, will face 3 to 8 years in prison.</p>
<h2>China Crypto Miners Shift to Africa</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The warning comes at a time when China’s blanket ban on crypto mining, implemented in 2018, followed a mass exodus of miners to various African nations. This is mainly due to the drastic decrease in the electricity price per unit.</p>
<p>Angola, for instance, decreased electricity prices to $17.1 per megawatt hour in 2020. This was the lowest level during the period observed. Overall, prices for electrical energy have been decreasing in the country, according to Statista.</p>
<p>As a result, the African nation has become a hotbed for crypto miners, particularly blackballed from nations like China.</p>
<p>“Since last year, several Chinese citizens in Angolan have been held legally responsible for engaging in virtual &#8220;mining&#8221; and suspected of illegal use of electricity,” the Embassy noted.</p>
<p>The warning also stressed key hazards of crypto mining, which could easily disrupt economic and financial order. It would also breed illegal and criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, pyramid schemes, etc.</p>
<p>The Embassy has specifically reminded Chinese citizens and institutions in Angola to strictly abide by the local rules. It cautioned them to use electricity in-accordance with the law, which does not engage in mining activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) iShares Bitcoin Trust trading under the ticker “IBIT” has seen inflows 69 days straight, said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in a social media post.</p>
<p>The fourth Bitcoin halving took place late on Friday at block height 840,000. This marked a pivotal change in the cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics. The halving event occurs approximately every four years and has reduced the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Waking up on 4/20 to see <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBIT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$IBIT</a> took in cash for the 69th straight day, which was also the halving. It’s a little too perfect <a href="https://t.co/7Z8W3t9L7h">https://t.co/7Z8W3t9L7h</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1781657113221091718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Bitcoin halving has in turn triggered a supply squeeze. R<span>eductions are part of a predefined strategy to limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million, enhancing its scarcity by halving the influx of new coins into circulation.</span></p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://twitter.com/FarsideUK/status/1781529848730583502">data</a> from Farside Investments shows that Bitcoin ETF flows are once again gaining momentum after experiencing a slowdown in inflows despite the highly anticipated<span> bullish Bitcoin halving event.</span></p>
<h2><span>Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East Impacting Market </span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The growing Israel-Iran conflict has played a role in impacting the Bitcoin price. Last week <span>Bitcoin saw a sell-off and experienced volatility triggered by the military situation in the Middle East. </span>Usually, Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against global uncertainty. On Monday, Bitcoin price remains stable trading at around<span> $66,300.</span></p>
<div>&#8220;One financial effect of the conflict in Israel was the strengthening of the Dollar, for instance, measured by the U.S. Dollar Index. This is a move towards safety. Portfolio managers reduce the exposure to high-volatility assets in such a situation. Bitcoin has one of the highest historical volatilities in a portfolio that contains stocks and bonds too. So portfolio managers sell Bitcoin to effectively reduce their portfolio volatility,&#8221; B<span>asile Maire, a co-founder of D8X, a decentralized exchange told Cryptonews. </span></div>
<h2>Macro-Driven BTC Price Largely Driven by Bitcoin ETF Trading</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<div>
<div>
<p lang="EN-US"><span>Maire went on to explain that w</span>e have seen similar Bitcoin price actions earlier this year that coincided with a Dollar strengthening or flight-to-safety. These political events often have a short-lived impact on financial markets.</p>
<p lang="EN-US">&#8220;It looks like macro-driven price impacts on Bitcoin are largely sparked by Bitcoin ETF trading as opposed to crypto-native trading. The introduction of ETFs also seems to strengthen the impact of macro-events on Bitcoin prices,&#8221; said <span>Maire.</span></p>
<p lang="EN-US">&#8220;From the standpoint of portfolio management, it&#8217;s understandable that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may experience sharper declines compared to stocks and other traditional assets in this situation,&#8221; explains Maire.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p lang="EN-US">This doesn&#8217;t contradict Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a hedge against global uncertainty in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/modernizing-financial-markets-with-wcbdc/"><span>released a report</span></a> investigating wholesale <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">central bank digital currencies</a> (wCBDCs). The document explored ongoing initiatives, potential use cases in financial markets, and the potential of wCBDCs to alleviate significant industry challenges and address key pain points.</p>
<p>It revealed that more than 98% of central banks worldwide are conducting research, pilot programs, or implementation of CBDCs to enhance the functionality of and broaden access to central bank money (CeBM).</p>
<p>“CeBM is ideal for systemically important transactions despite the emergence of alternative payment instruments,” the report states. “Wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) is a form of CeBM that could unlock new economic models and integration points that are not possible today.”</p>
<h2>Building Efficiency in Interbank Operations with CeBM</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report states that CeBM is a particularly suitable choice for interbank payments and securities transactions due to several key characteristics. Firstly, CeBM eliminates credit and liquidity risks, aligning with the recommendations of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) for critical transactions. This reduces the possibility of financial instability stemming from these areas.</p>
<p>Secondly, CeBM facilitates final settlement of transactions. Backed by a robust legal framework, it guarantees the irreversible transfer of assets, fostering confidence and stability within the financial system.</p>
<p>Finally, CeBM promotes financial stability by acting as a virtually risk-free instrument. It complements existing credit creation processes without introducing additional risks, ensuring a healthy financial ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Disparate Settlement Cycles Hinder Efficiency</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report identified eight longstanding challenges within the industry, with four specifically highlighted as areas where a wCBDC could offer significant value. These areas represent opportunities for modernization using wCBDC technology.</p>
<p>One key challenge is the issue of &#8220;disparate settlement cycles&#8221; in cross-border securities settlements. The globalization of capital markets necessitates harmonized settlement cycles across different regions. However, most real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems operate within limited windows.</p>
<p>For instance, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has identified a narrow five-hour window (from 6 AM to 11 AM GMT) with maximum overlap between systems. To address this limitation, the report proposes that wCBDC could facilitate a global settlement window, effectively extending the reach of RTGS systems by offering near 24/7 operation.</p>
<p>“This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible and secure future for financial markets,” it said.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The demand for block 840,000 was largely driven by enthusiasts of memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) competing to inscribe and etch rare satoshis using the Runes protocol, a newly launched token standard that debuted at the halving block. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A total of 3,050 transactions were included in that block, resulting in an average fee of slightly under $800 per user.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The elevated block fees persisted until approximately block 840,200, as per mempool.space. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, fees have fallen to around 1-2 Bitcoin per block. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The substantial block fee payouts to miners during the halving day initially shielded them from the impact of the block subsidy reduction from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, with the average block fee now well below 3.125 Bitcoin, miners are feeling the effects of the halving.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, Bitcoin has surpassed Ethereum in terms of fees for six consecutive days between April 15th and 20th, with the 7-day fee average standing at $17.8 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, the Bitcoin halving event did not significantly impact the price of Bitcoin, which has risen by 1.5% since then, reaching $64,840, as reported by CoinGecko.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Surges After Halving</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Bitcoin did not immediately react to the much-anticipated halving event, the leading cryptocurrency has since registered some gains. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $66,266, up by almost 2% over the past day, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While some analysts, including JPMorgan, have cautioned about a potential further price slide following this quadrennial event, the overall consensus remains bullish in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Just recently, Bitwise said that while the month immediately following the halving typically sees a modest drop in price, the subsequent year often </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/asset-manager-bitwise-says-market-underestimates-long-term-impact-of-halving.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">witnesses exponential gains</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The asset manager noted that following the 2012 halving, Bitcoin experienced a meager 9% increase in the month post-halving, only to skyrocket by a staggering 8,839% over the following year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similar patterns were observed after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with Bitcoin’s price surging significantly in the year following each event.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Likewise, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has recently said that Bitcoin may experience some selling pressure in the lead-up to the highly anticipated halving event, but the long-term </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-long-term-outlook-remains-bullish-despite-selling-pressure-ahead-of-halving-crypto-com-ceo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">outlook remains bullish</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world&#8217;s leading stablecoin issuer Tether has made a fast start on The Open Network (TON), issuing $60 million worth of USDT since <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usdt-payments-launching-with-telegram-wallet-and-the-open-network.htm">integrating with the blockchain on April 19th</a>. This makes TON the 11th blockchain to host Tether, expanding its reach and offering new options for users.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the two, announced at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, also saw the launch of Tether Gold (XAUT) on TON. This gold-pegged stablecoin offers users additional diversification options.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-ceo-details-partnership-with-fbi-and-secret-service-in-letter-to-legislators.htm">Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino</a> expressed optimism about the partnership, calling it a &#8220;great start&#8221; with $35 million issued initially.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Already 35M USDt issued on TON.<br />Great start!</p>
<p>&mdash; Paolo Ardoino <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f350.png" alt="🍐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@paoloardoino) <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1781956881663074639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Tether Transparency report confirms the figure has grown to $60 million within just two days.</p>
<p>This integration has significant implications for Telegram users. Tether&#8217;s presence on TON allows for instant and free cross-border payments between all platform users. The integration allows to send payments across without the need of a blockchain address or downloading separate apps. According to Telegram, sending money will be as simple as sending a direct message.</p>
<h2>Tether and Ton’s Seamless Integration With Fiat Currencies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tether on <a href="https://ton.org/">TON</a> also boasts seamless integration with fiat currencies. Users can expect easy on-ramping from most global currencies at launch, with off-ramping functionalities planned soon. This will allow users to convert their Tether back to fiat and withdraw it directly to bank accounts or cards.</p>
<p>While TON is a new addition, Tether&#8217;s dominant presence remains on the Tron network, holding over $57.8 billion worth of USDT. Ethereum, once the leader, currently holds $51 billion, reflecting a gradual shift as Tether seeks to escape Ethereum&#8217;s high network fees. Solana stands as the third-largest Tether host with $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>Tether currently holds a staggering 69% share of the entire stablecoin market, valued at roughly $159.5 billion according to CoinGecko. Its closest competitor, Circle&#8217;s USD Coin (USDC), holds a 21% share with $33.7 billion in circulation.</p>
<p>While TON’s price initially spiked 22% on the Tether announcement, it has since returned to previous levels. At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading down 1.1% at $6.15.</p>

<p>Amid a vibrant market rally, the cryptocurrency Bonk price (BONK/USD) stands out, currently trading at $0.000021 with a remarkable 24-hour trading volume of $434.6 million.</p>
<p>As Bonk secures a 5.89% increase and a market cap of about $1.34 billion, it ranks #70 on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>This surge prompts an intriguing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bonk-price-prediction/#:~:text=Our%20price%20forecast%20predicts%20that,%240.00001020%20for%20Bonk%20in%202024.">Bonk price prediction</a>: could this momentum herald a shift in the meme coin hierarchy, potentially challenging Dogecoin’s dominance?</p>
<h2>Bonk Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The pivot point, a key technical indicator used to determine overall market trends and potential reversal points, is currently set at $0.000022 for <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bonk1/">Bonk</a>. This level serves as a crucial marker for traders to assess the directional movements of the asset.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance Levels</strong> Bonk faces immediate resistance at $0.000025, with subsequent resistance levels at $0.000027 and $0.000029. These thresholds represent critical points where selling pressure might intensify, potentially capping further gains unless significant buying momentum occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Support Levels</strong> On the downside, immediate support is found at $0.000018, followed by stronger support levels at $0.000015 and $0.000013.</p>
<p>These figures are essential for traders as areas where buying interest might solidify, providing a foundation for the price if downward pressures mount.</p>
<figure id="attachment_201451" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201451" style="width: 1753px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-201451 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165.png" alt="Bonk Price Prediction" width="1753" height="911" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165.png 1753w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165-300x156.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165-1024x532.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165-768x399.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165-1536x798.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22014911/1713750551-image-165-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1753px) 100vw, 1753px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201451" class="wp-caption-text">Bonk Price Prediction</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bonk is currently at 78, suggesting that the asset may be in an overbought territory.</p>
<p>Typically, an RSI above 70 indicates that a security might be overvalued and could face a potential pullback.</p>
<p>Conversely, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.000017 supports a generally bullish trend from a longer-term perspective but confirms the near-term overbought condition suggested by the RSI.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Indicators and Candlestick Patterns:</strong> The current chart formation shows a spinning top candlestick under the $0.000022 resistance level.</p>
<p>This pattern, characterized by a small body with longer upper and lower shadows, indicates indecision among traders, suggesting potential for a reversal or consolidation.</p>
<p>This, combined with the resistance posed by the downward trendline at $0.000022, hints at possible bearish correction in the near term.</p>
<h3>Market Outlook</h3>
<p>Based on the technical outlook, Bonk is currently positioned bearishly below its pivot point of $0.000022. A break above this level could shift momentum and foster a more bullish bias.</p>
<p>Conversely, failure to overcome this barrier may encourage a downward correction, aligning with the overbought signals indicated by the RSI.</p>

<p><span>In the latest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin price prediction</a>, the cryptocurrency has climbed to $65,225, marking a 1.50% increase on Sunday. </span></p>
<p><span>This uptick reflects growing investor confidence, potentially influenced by high-profile investments and bullish market sentiment surrounding digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span> As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> continues to draw interest from both retail and institutional investors, its trajectory remains a focal point in the financial landscape.</span></p>
<h2><span>Michael Saylor&#8217;s Strategic Bitcoin Investments Catapult Net Worth to $4 Billion in 2024</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Michael Saylor, a dot-com billionaire who once faced a $6 billion loss in a single day, has significantly bolstered his wealth through astute investments in Bitcoin and his company&#8217;s shares.</p>
<p>In 2024 alone, Saylor&#8217;s assets surged by 60%, reaching $3.49 billion, thanks to an 86% rise in MicroStrategy stock since January, driven by Bitcoin&#8217;s gains and new ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andy Vermaut shares:A dot-com entrepreneur who once lost $6 billion in one day has made billions from the Bitcoin rally and his company&#39;s surging shares: Saylor has billions of dollars worth of paper gains from his holdings of MicroStrategy… <a href="https://t.co/3AiSEuXsUY">https://t.co/3AiSEuXsUY</a> Thank you. <a href="https://t.co/DVFjs9hjNb">pic.twitter.com/DVFjs9hjNb</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This growth has pushed Saylor’s net worth close to $4 billion. Despite previous setbacks during the dot-com bubble, Saylor remains a fervent advocate for Bitcoin, predicting it will eclipse gold as a dependable store of wealth.</p>
<p>His success underscores growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, with MicroStrategy often viewed as a proxy for the cryptocurrency, further validating Bitcoin as a viable investment.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Saylor&#8217;s net worth nears $4 billion, fueled by Bitcoin and MicroStrategy shares.</li>
<li>Saylor champions Bitcoin, foreseeing its rise over gold as a store of wealth.</li>

<h2><span>Grayscale Launches Bitcoin Mini Trust with Industry-Low 0.15% Fee to Boost Accessibility</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Grayscale is challenging its competitors by launching the Bitcoin Mini Trust, which offers the lowest fee among spot <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/662485d7b6bf785084e751b2/">Bitcoin ETFs at just 0.15%</a>.</p>
<p>This move is designed to make its offerings more competitive, particularly against the backdrop of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which previously charged a higher fee of 1.5%.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grayscale&#39;s Planned Mini Bitcoin ETF Will Have a 0.15% Fee, the Lowest Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs <a href="https://t.co/vgffrZxWKz">https://t.co/vgffrZxWKz</a>   <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>By transferring 10% of GBTC&#8217;s assets to the new Mini Trust, Grayscale provides a more cost-effective investment option without triggering capital gains taxes for investors who switch.</p>
<p>This strategic decision aligns with the growing demand for more affordable cryptocurrency investment vehicles, potentially attracting a broader investor base and enhancing Bitcoin&#8217;s market presence.</p>
<p>With over $19.6 billion under management, Grayscale remains a significant figure in the cryptocurrency investment landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Grayscale introduces Bitcoin Mini Trust with an industry-low fee of 0.15%.</li>
<li>Strategic asset transfer from GBTC to Mini Trust enhances affordability.</li>
<li>Move aims to expand Bitcoin’s accessibility and attract more investors.</li>

<h2><span>IRS Drafts New Digital Asset Tax Form, Experts Warn of Privacy Risks</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The IRS has introduced a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f1099da--dft.pdf">draft of tax Form 1099-DA</a> to enhance the reporting of digital asset transactions, which includes a requirement for brokers and providers of unhosted wallets to disclose transaction proceeds.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency tax expert Shehan Chandrasekera voices significant concerns over the inclusion of wallet addresses on the form, citing it as a potential threat to user privacy and data security.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Set to take effect in 2025, this form aims to collect detailed transaction data, potentially undermining the anonymity traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Chandrasekera warns of the serious privacy and security implications of the IRS&#8217;s data collection practices.</p>
<p>This regulatory move could influence the operational dynamics of cryptocurrency platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, possibly necessitating KYC procedures for unhosted wallets and fundamentally altering the DeFi landscape.</p>

<h2 class="c-message_attachment">Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC/USD)&#8217;</a>s  pivot point stands at $64,850, the cryptocurrency exhibits potential for further ascension if it can sustain this level.</p>
<p>Technical analysis points to immediate resistance at $66,910, with subsequent barriers at $69,232 and $71,425.</p>
<p>Should Bitcoin falter, it faces downward pressure towards support levels at $63,045, $61,387, and $59,686, which could stabilize declines or trigger a sharper sell-off.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56, suggesting moderate buying activity, while the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $64,682 provides near support, reinforcing the bullish scenario above the pivot point but cautioning of potential declines if this threshold is breached.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Located near Hell&#8217;s Gate National Park, the miners have set up shop at the site of an extinct volcano, where they utilize a mobile container equipped with solar power and energy from a nearby geothermal site. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This unique setup allows them to mine Bitcoin while simultaneously electrifying local communities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The venture </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is led</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by a startup called Gridless, backed by Jack Dorsey&#8217;s Block. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gridless Operates Six Mines</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gridless operates six mines across Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, all powered by a combination of renewable energy sources. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Most people think about bitcoin and the price of bitcoin and how they can save value in it or maybe spend it,” Gridless CEO Erik Hersman </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/20/bitcoin-miner-gridless-backed-by-block-builds-site-at-kenya-volcano.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">told CNBC</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“That doesn’t happen without the bitcoin miners and us </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">being globally distributed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin mining is a process that requires substantial amounts of electricity. Miners worldwide run powerful computers to validate transactions and create new tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Seeking the cheapest </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sources of power</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, miners often face challenges due to fluctuating cryptocurrency prices. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value has renewed interest in mining operations, making it more profitable to continue supporting the network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysts predict a shift in the geography of crypto mining following the recent halving event, as profit margins become slimmer. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Countries with lower energy costs, such as </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">those in</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, are attracting crypto miners. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> presents an opportunity for renewable energy developers in these regions to utilize their excess power and support the expanding Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gridless&#8217;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Bitcoin Mining Operations Serve Dual Purpose</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gridless, founded by Hersman and his co-founders Philip Walton and Janet Maingi, aims to bridge the gap between power generation and capacity in Africa. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With approximately 600 million people lacking access to electricity, the company&#8217;s Bitcoin mining operations serve a dual purpose. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They harness renewable energy sources that would otherwise go to waste and provide electricity to homes and businesses in underserved communities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The volcanic region where Gridless operates, known as Hell&#8217;s Gate, has a rich history and is home to diverse wildlife. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By leveraging the energy potential of volcanoes, geothermal power stations have been established in the area. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This approach is not unique to Kenya; other countries like Iceland and El Salvador have also harnessed geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin mining has faced criticism due to its energy consumption. However, when coupled with renewable energy sources, it can help unlock trapped renewable power and incentivize increased production.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers, utilizing excess power from renewable sources and providing financial incentives for further development.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gridless has </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">not only</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> powered thousands of households </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">but also</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> facilitated containerized cold storage for local farmers, charging stations for electric motorcycles, and public WiFi points.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Through its mining operations, the company is making renewable energy economically viable in Africa while contributing to the secure functioning of the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It’s not </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">really</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> sexy,” Hersman said. </span></p>

<p>With a significant 24-hour trading volume of $2.97 billion and a price surge to $151.34, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> showcases robust market performance.</p>
<p>This 5% increase over the last day has propelled <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana</a>&#8216;s market capitalization to approximately $67.62 billion, cementing its position as the fifth largest by market cap.</p>
<p>As market watchers closely monitor these developments, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/solana-price-prediction/#:~:text=Our%20Solana%20price%20prediction%20expects,hit%20a%20high%20of%20%24380.">Solana price predictions</a> become increasingly optimistic, let&#8217;s take a look at Solana&#8217;s technical outlook.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Solana&#8217;s pivot point set at $147.20 with an immediate resistance at $164.56, with further hurdles at $185.94 and $204.26.</p>
<p>Should the momentum continue, crossing these barriers could indicate a stronger bullish trend for Solana.</p>
<p>Conversely, support levels are identified at $126.23, followed by $110.96 and $92.64. These levels could provide significant bounce-back points if downward pressures emerge.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 39, suggesting that Solana is nearing oversold conditions, which may prompt buying interest if it dips further.</p>
<figure id="attachment_201400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201400" style="width: 1735px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-201400 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162.png" alt="Solana Price Prediction" width="1735" height="904" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162.png 1735w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162-300x156.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162-1024x534.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162-768x400.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162-1536x800.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20205748/1713646668-image-162-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1735px) 100vw, 1735px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201400" class="wp-caption-text">Solana Price Prediction</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $156.28 presents a potential resistance level.</p>
<p>The EMA&#8217;s proximity to the current price implies that Solana is testing significant technical thresholds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the current outlook for Solana is bullish above the $147.20 pivot, a drop below this mark could trigger a sharper sell-off.</p>
<p>Investors and traders will be watching these levels closely, as a breakout could lead to further gains, while failure to hold could see Solana retreating to lower support zones.</p>
<p>The key will be whether Solana can sustain its upward momentum amidst the broader market conditions and overcome the resistance posed by the 50-day EMA.</p>

<p><span>Bitcoin, currently trading at $63,999 with a 3.50% increase post-halving, introduces a supply squeeze that might kickstart a new bull market. </span></p>
<p><span>The event cuts the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins, underpinning Bitcoin&#8217;s strategy to cap its total supply at 21 million coins. </span></p>
<p><span>While the halving aims to increase scarcity and potentially boost prices, the immediate market reaction has been subdued, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $64,000. </span></p>
<h2><b>Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze Shakes Up the Market</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The fourth <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> took place late Friday at block height 840,000, marking a pivotal change in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply dynamics. This event, occurring approximately every four years, reduces the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins.</p>
<p>Such reductions are part of a predefined strategy to limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million, enhancing its scarcity by halving the influx of new coins into circulation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Bitcoin network completes the fourth-ever ‘halving’ of rewards to miners <a href="https://t.co/2ZoDt4k69b">https://t.co/2ZoDt4k69b</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1781478493802406018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the potential for a supply squeeze to elevate prices, the immediate market reaction was understated, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price stabilizing around $64,000.</p>
<p>This muted response might stem from the halving already being factored into the price, reflecting a more sophisticated market understanding compared to earlier halvings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The halving reduces the mining reward, thus tightening Bitcoin&#8217;s supply.</li>
<li>Immediate market reaction has been calm, possibly due to pre-event pricing adjustments.</li>
<li>Long-term effects remain uncertain, although historical trends suggest possible price increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is too soon to determine the long-term impact of this halving, historical trends have shown significant price rallies following such events. However, whether this pattern will repeat remains to be seen, as each halving unfolds under unique market conditions.</p>
<h2><span>Bitcoin Halving 2024: Miner Rewards Cut Sparks Surge in Mining Stocks</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/19/google-searches-for-bitcoin-halving-get-higher-than-420/">Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024</a>, significantly altered the compensation landscape for Bitcoin miners by slashing the block reward from 6 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This pivotal event, which occurs roughly every four years, drastically impacts the economic viability of mining activities.</p>
<p>Leading up to the halving, anticipation fueled a rise in the stock prices of major Bitcoin mining firms, reflecting investor speculation about which companies would adapt best to the new reward structure.</p>
<p>Notable firms like Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw their stock prices increase by over 10%, with similar gains observed in other prominent companies such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Clean Spark (CLSK).</p>

<li>Bitcoin in half, directly affecting profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on stock prices:</strong> Mining firms on the Nasdaq experienced substantial stock price increases due to pre-halving speculation.</li>
<li><strong>Operational adjustments:</strong> Mining companies are compelled to refine their strategies, often by expanding operations to mitigate the impact of reduced rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-halving, mining operations must enhance their efficiency and possibly seek additional capital to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Historical trends suggest that although total miner revenue typically drops shortly after a halving, it tends to recover over the year as Bitcoin&#8217;s price potentially increases and larger mining operations expand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f1099da--dft.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">released a draft of Form 1099-DA</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for reporting income derived from digital asset transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Titled &#8220;Digital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions,&#8221; the form is expected to be implemented in 2025 for reporting purposes in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under the new regulations, brokers, including kiosk operators, digital asset payment processors, hosted wallet providers, and unhosted wallet providers, will </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">be responsible for preparing</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Form 1099-DA for customers engaged in selling or exchanging digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Copies of the form will be sent to both customers and the IRS, enabling the tax authority to verify reported information.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Draft Form Requires Inclusion of Addresses</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The draft form requires the inclusion of token codes, wallet addresses, and blockchain transaction locations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a rule proposed in August 2023, cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and stablecoins will be subject to reporting. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rule aims to enhance the IRS&#8217;s ability to identify taxpayers involved in digital asset transactions, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which are</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> often challenging to detect without third-party reporting.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upon </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the announcement of</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the proposed reporting requirements, the crypto community expressed mixed reactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Blockchain Association criticized the rule, citing &#8220;fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of digital assets and decentralized technology.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similarly, Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, warned that the rules could establish a concerning precedent of financial surveillance, as nearly all digital asset transactions, even minor ones like purchasing a cup of coffee, would need to be reported.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tax Experts Raise Concerns</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tax experts have also raised concerns regarding the new reporting rule. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ledgible, a crypto tax and accounting service, highlighted the challenges of reporting decentralized finance transactions where intermediaries may not exist to fulfill reporting requirements. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ledgible&#39;s own Jessalyn Dean takes a look at the new draft 1099-DA, and walks you through what stands out, what&#39;s surprising, and everything you need to know. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/taxinformation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#taxinformation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/digitalassets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#digitalassets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/regulation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#regulation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IRS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IRS</a> <a href="https://t.co/jw7iakRj93">https://t.co/jw7iakRj93</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, brokers will face an increased administrative burden as they process </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a large volume of</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The accurate determination of</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> cost basis (initial value or purchase price) for digital asset transfers will require information sharing among brokers, which currently lacks an established mechanism. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, distinguishing between self-transfers and taxable transfers when a crypto owner moves assets between exchanges remains </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a challenge</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxpayers who previously underreported their crypto income may face scrutiny when reporting their taxes in 2025. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While users of foreign exchanges that do not formally serve </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">U.S.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> citizens may not submit the form, the IRS can potentially detect offshore activity if assets </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">are subsequently transferred</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to a </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">U.S.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> exchange.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The draft form is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">currently</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> open for public comments, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback and suggestions before its finalization. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Countries </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">around the world</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are increasingly recognizing the need to tax cryptocurrency holdings as the digital currency market expands.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brazil, for instance, has introduced legislation effective </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">from</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> January 1, 2024, imposing a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brazilian-senate-oks-15-crypto-tax-rate.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tax of up to 15%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> on profits from cryptocurrencies held overseas by Brazilian nationals​​.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meanwhile, India continues to enforce stiff taxes on crypto transactions, maintaining a 30% tax on profits and a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on all transactions​​.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Likewise, the UK national taxing authority asked crypto users last year to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tax-crackdown-uk-authorities-target-crypto-users-for-unpaid-taxes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">disclose any unpaid taxes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> they might have </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in order to</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> avoid fines.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-19/ftx-investors-settle-with-sam-bankman-fried-to-pursue-promoters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">court filings made on April 19</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the plaintiffs, who had sued FTX influencers in 2022, have decided to pursue their case against FTX promoters using information presented during </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> criminal </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">trial,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> rather than continuing to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">pursue</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> judgment against him.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The filing states that Bankman-Fried possesses knowledge and information that the plaintiffs and their counsel believe will be valuable in their cases against other defendants in the FTX multidistrict litigation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This information relates to the underlying actions, the connection to the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">company&#8217;s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> U.S. headquarters in Miami, Florida, and the involvement of other defendants in various states where jurisdiction </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is asserted</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Plaintiffs to Target FTX Influencers</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If approved by the court, the settlement would resolve the lawsuit between Bankman-Fried and the crypto users seeking compensation for losses incurred during the collapse of FTX. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposal suggests that the plaintiffs offered Bankman-Fried the opportunity to assist in prosecuting FTX influencers and aiding victim recovery by providing documents and testimony from his criminal trial. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, the information could shed light on the involvement of celebrities and companies such as Naomi Osaka, Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, and Shaquille </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">O&#8217;Neal</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, who endorsed the crypto exchange before its downfall.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawsuit was initially filed in November 2022, shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">was consolidated</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> into its current form in June 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Moskowitz Law Firm, known for handling crypto-based class-action lawsuits, represents the plaintiffs in this case.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> legal team filed a notice to appeal his conviction and sentence on April 11. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They have also requested that Bankman-Fried remain at the Metropolitan Detention Center in </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brooklyn,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> rather than being transferred to a federal prison in the San Francisco Bay </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Area,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to assist in his defense.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SBF Appeals Fraud Conviction and Sentence</span></h2>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last week, Bankman-Fried </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-files-notice-of-appeal-for-ftx-trial.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed to appeal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> his conviction and sentence for fraud and conspiracy charges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The disgraced crypto boss was convicted last November after a month-long trial on seven different charges and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">was sentenced</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to 25 years in federal prison.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In an additional court filing, attorneys for the FTX founder requested that Judge Lewis A. Kaplan keep Bankman-Fried at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> “</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">facilitate access to his appellate counsel</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as he works to overturn his sentence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During his sentencing, lawyers for Bankman-Fried called the Metropolitan Detention Center</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> “</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the worst federal jail in the country,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">with prisoners having experienced issues such as lack of access to water and poor electricity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, the FTX bankruptcy estate has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-liquidators-target-repayment-to-creditors-by-end-of-2024.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">outlined its target to initiate </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">repayments</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to customers</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the end of 2024, as disclosed during a meeting of FTX </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digital’s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Joint Official Liquidators in the Bahamas. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The FTX bankruptcy consists of two distinct processes, including the Chapter 11 bankruptcy </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">being</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> overseen</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by a Delaware court in the United States and the official liquidation of FTX Digital, the Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, both entities have agreed to collaborate, allowing creditors to submit their claims to either party while ensuring that no creditor receives less than their entitled value.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin halving is not that significant for price, though on-chain metrics suggest that Bitcoin hasn't quite reached bear market territory.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving-bull-market-glassnode.htm">Is The Bull Market Over Before The Bitcoin Halving? Glassnode Report</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin’s latest price dip to under $60,000 has raised questions as to whether the asset’s spectacular bull run this year could be ending earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Lead Glassnode analyst James Check, however, says bull have very little to worry about.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s Pullback: Dip Or Doom?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1781214390672621951">video analysis</a> posted on Friday, Check reviewed various on-chain metrics concerning short-term Bitcoin holders, who first acquired their coins less than five months prior.</p>
<p>Firstly, Bitcoin’s short-term holder MVRV ratio is now re-approaching 1.0, meaning its unrealized profit and loss have reached a break-even point. This level can serve as support after a bull market dip, but also major resistance during bear markets when most Bitcoin holders are underwater.</p>
<p>“Little undercuts are good,” said Check. “In 2023 we had several of these retests. If we assume this is a resilient uptrend, we should expect the short-term holder cost basis to hold, somewhere in that $58,000 to $59,000 region. “</p>
<p>Similarly, short-term holder SOPR has also recently dipped beneath 1.0, meaning that short-term holders are now beginning to realize more losses than profits. Should SOPR fall significantly under this level without resurfacing, it may be a sign of a sustained bear market to come.</p>
<p>As of this week, short-term holders realized losses have spiked substantially – a sign that new buyers were panic selling at a loss amid news of rising conflict between Iran and Israel.</p>
<p>“This is essentially what you do want to see, as a contrarian,” Check added. “As a contrarian, you kind of want to see people doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.”</p>
<p>Days ago, Check noted that Bitcoin’s price may transition into being “top-heavy” if its price moves below $58,800. The asset trades for $64,000 at writing time.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s Long Term Momentum</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Other metrics like the AVIV momentum indicator suggest that Bitcoin price momentum remains positive on longer time frames, merely experiencing a cooldown on the 30-day timeframe for a “proper reset.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The AVIV Momentum indicator also remains in positive territory, with all timeframes hitting higher altitudes on each successive peak.</p>
<p>A cooldown is underway on the faster 30-day indicator, which is what we want to see for a proper reset.<a href="https://t.co/hk4UJ1FZ7x">https://t.co/hk4UJ1FZ7x</a> <a href="https://t.co/aSDhff53AM">pic.twitter.com/aSDhff53AM</a></p>
<p>&mdash; _Checkmate <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f7e0.png" alt="🟠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f511.png" alt="🔑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2622.png" alt="☢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e2.png" alt="🛢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@_Checkmatey_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1780765932035653882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> itself, Check believes its financial impact may be overhyped. Compared to Bitcoin futures volume, spot volume, and ETF trade volume, the daily BTC issued to miners is a tiny fraction of the market.</p>
<p>“The size of the halving, is a narrative game more than it is in terms of size now… it’s just very very small,” he said.</p>

<p><span>Given the rising popularity of digital assets in the U.S., industry experts believe that education about cryptocurrency has become increasingly necessary. </span></p>
<h2><b>Bitcoin Educational Initiatives In The U.S. </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Kendra Cole, Co-founder and CEO of Sparrow Finance, told Cryptonews that the recent a</span><span>pproval of </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/navigating-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-the-us-what-you-need-to-know.htm"><span>Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S</span></a><span>. has </span><span>pushed digital assets to the mainstream. </span></p>
<p><span>Cole believes that individuals—particularly women and children—must be presented with better educational opportunities regarding Bitcoin adoption. </span></p>
<p><span>“The impetus for women to get involved in Bitcoin now is to build stronger bonds through shared experiences and interests,” said Cole. “We know that women are oftentimes the chief financial officers of the home, making the majority of the financial and gifting decisions. Sparrow Finance aims to provide the tools to do this through Bitcoin education.” </span></p>
<p><span>During Financial Capability Month, Cole shared that Sparrow Finance participated in </span><span>Chicago’s Ultimate Baby Shower. Th</span><span>is was a community-wide event for parents to discuss financial education.  </span></p>
<p><span>“During this gathering, we met with new parents to provide information about how women can get involved with digital assets,” she said. “We also discussed ways for women to leverage Bitcoin to build connections with loved ones.” </span></p>
<p><span>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is also focused on crypto education this month. A Coinbase spokesperson told Cryptonews that 87% of Americans want to update the financial system. </span></p>
<p><span>“The top drivers of this discontent are frustration over fees and speed,” the spokesperson noted. “The current system costs regular Americans too much, takes too long, and gets you less for your money over time.”</span></p>
<p><span>In order to shed light on this, </span><span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-advertises-bitcoin-halving-in-new-commercial.htm">Coinbase released a commercial</a> this week explaining the Bitcoin halving</span><span> event to the masses. </span></p>
<p><span>“The spot will air on major U.S. channels, including TNT, ESPN, and ABC during the NBA Playoff games,” the spokesperson said. “The commercial will run from April 17 through April 22.” </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Food for thought:<br />What if money was designed to get you more over time, not less?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://t.co/z8eHF8JltQ">pic.twitter.com/z8eHF8JltQ</a></p>

<p><span>Coinbase believes that this advertisement sends viewers an important educational message. </span></p>
<p><span>“This April, the rate of new Bitcoins created will be cut in half—just like it has been every four years or so since it was created in 2009,” the spokesperson explained. “This halving ensures its supply remains finite over time (similar to gold).”</span></p>
<p><span>Coinbase added that the company’s marketing philosophy seeks to meet audiences where they are “in a tech-forward way.” “All of our campaigns have both online and offline components, and we invite the audience to participate,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span>BlackRock, the San Francisco-based asset management giant with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, also recently released an educational series covering Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span>A series of four short videos focused on different Bitcoin topics are available on Blackrock’s </span><a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/education/investing-with-bitcoin"><span>official website</span></a><span>. Bitcoin ETFs, the halving event, security, and Bitcoin adoption are all discussed in easy-to-understand language. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, Blackrock’s educational video on the Bitcoin halving notes, “To ensure no more than 21 million coins enter circulation, every four years there is what is known as a halving event, where the amount of bitcoin issued to miners for completing each block is cut in half.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto Education Increases Across The World</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>While crypto education is becoming increasingly important in the U.S., a number of initiatives are being launched throughout the world as well.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/bitget-launches-blockchain4youth-project-plans-to-invest-10-million-to-support-young-talents-301815841.html">Bitget recently </a></span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/bitget-launches-blockchain4youth-project-plans-to-invest-10-million-to-support-young-talents-301815841.html"><span>announced</span></a><span> that it will allocate up to $10 million to the corporate social responsibility Blockchain4Youth project. </span></p>
<p><span>Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, told Cryptonews that the purpose of this undertaking is to support young talent while establishing a blockchain-friendly educational environment.</span></p>
<p><span>“Since the launch of Blockchain4Youth in May 2023, the program has been hosting campus roadshows around the world to educate global youth about blockchain knowledge,” said Chen. “This month, Bitget hosted a Blockchain4Youth event at Ton Duc Thang University in Ho Chi Minh City as part of the HUB FORUM 2024 event, gathering over 1,000 students from various universities in Ho Chi Minh City.”</span></p>
<p><span>Chen pointed out that hosting events like Blockchain4Youth has become a necessity, noting that a recent </span><span>Bitget study</span><span> found that Millennials and GenZ’s are likely to become the <a href="https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitget-study-reveals-forty-six-percent-of-millennials-across-major-countries-own-cryptocurrencies">main drivers of crypto adoption</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Chen added that Bitget has other educational crypto events planned in the Philippines and Japan later this month as well. </span></p>
<p><span>“Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide financial access to people who are underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems,” she said. “Education can help bridge the gap by teaching people how to use cryptocurrencies and access financial services in a decentralized manner.”</span></p>
<p><span>Stablecoin issuer </span><span>Tether also recently established an educational initiative in the Middle East</span><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The USDT issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-partners-with-fuze-to-promote-digital-asset-awareness-in-turkey-and-the-middle-east.htm">partnered with digital asset infrastructure provider Fuze</a> to create digital asset awareness for businesses and individuals across Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span><a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-and-fuze-forge-strategic-collaboration-to-elevate-digital-asset-education-in-turkey-and-the-middle-east/">Tether and Fuze will develop programs</a> and workshops to enhance awareness and understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology among local financial institutions. </span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto Education Remains Challenging</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>While it’s notable that crypto education is becoming prioritized, challenges associated with digital assets may create barriers. </span></p>
<p><span>For instance, Cole believes that the biggest challenge involved with digital asset education is overcoming the knowledge and confidence gap. </span></p>
<p><span>“This gap disproportionately affects women, who juggle multifaceted responsibilities —like their career, family, and finances —all while navigating the complexities of digital assets,” she said. “Amidst all of this, finding time to delve into digital asset education can seem daunting.”</span></p>
<p><span>To overcome these obstacles, Cole views the power of community and in-person events as ways to help women and families understand cryptocurrency.  </span></p>
<p><span>While this may be the case, Chen believes the crypto industry’s fast-paced nature is problematic for most individuals. </span></p>
<p><span>“The cryptocurrency industry may see new innovations emerge every month, week, or even daily,” she said. “Only learners with a high level of curiosity and initiative are able to keep up with the crypto industry&#8217;s pace effectively.”</span></p>
<p><span>Given this, Chen noted that individuals wanting to learn about digital assets shouldn’t rely solely on articles, videos, books, or the internet to grasp the industry fully.</span></p>
