										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto-supportive litigator John Deaton is off to a strong start in his bid to displace Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren from her place in Parliament ‚Äì at least when it comes to fundraising.</p>
<h2>John Deaton&#8217;s Campaign Fundraising</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As reported by Eleanor Terret of Fox Business, the lawyer-turned-senate hopeful raised $1.36 million for his campaign Q1, compared to Warren‚Äôs $1.1 million.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to his campaign, Deaton has received donations from prominent figures in the crypto industry such as Ripple execs Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Charles Hoskinson, Jameson Lopp, and Anthony Scaramucci,‚Äù Terret <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1778797246751904135">wrote</a> to X on Friday.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/12/crypto-executives-put-money-behind-longshot-bid-to-oust-elizabeth-warren-00151882?nname=massachusetts-playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-704c-d54c-a1ff-fb6da68f0000&amp;nrid=172e6d46-d5a8-44ae-98a9-b9b547df46d9&amp;nlid=630384"><em>Politico</em></a>, donors including Garlinghouse, Larsen, Scaramucci, and the Winklevoss twins put down the maximum donations of $6600 for his campaign.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Deaton‚Äôs large, largely corporate funding is as foretold by Warren, who <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-responds-to-senate-challenge-from-john-deaton-im-not-afraid.htm">issued warnings</a> to her followers in February in anticipation of Deaton‚Äôs campaign announcement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid, but this now means we need to prepare to compete against funding from powerful special interests, Wall Street, and the GOP,‚Äù she said at the time.</p>
<p>Deaton‚Äôs history with the crypto industry is no secret. He‚Äôs best known for representing 75,000 XRP holders in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that closed last year, which mostly panned out in Ripple‚Äôs favor.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs also blasted the SEC for harshly treating the crypto industry in several other high-profile lawsuits, including its fight with Grayscale ‚Äì the issuer of the world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin ETF. The result of that lawsuit ultimately forced the SEC into allowing Bitcoin spot ETFs to trade, which Elizabeth Warren loudly disapproved of.</p>
<h2>Is Elizabeth Warren Worried?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Beyond crypto, Warren and Deaton fiercely disagree on other partisan topics: student loan forgiveness, the migrant crisis, and loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve beaten the odds as an underdog my entire life and I‚Äôm going to do it again. The only difference this time, is the world will get to witness it,‚Äù Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1778794486631379390">wrote</a> to X on Friday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/12/politics/white-house-iran-threat-israel/index.html">Israel is braced for a counterattack</a> from Iran after they recently took out IRGC military leaders in Syria.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Tensions have been high in the Middle East since the October 7<sup>th</sup> Hamas attack against Israel, and Israel‚Äôs devastating counterattack into Gaza.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/%5d">Bitcoin</a> was a relative safe haven versus most of the market, dropping just 4.5% to $67,000. That leaves it still only about 9% down from its recent record highs near $74,000.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> increasingly viewed as a form of digital gold, it could even rally if Iran/Israel/US tensions rise further.</p>
<p>But with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">halving</a> around the corner and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-daly-absolutely-no-urgency-cut-us-interest-rates-2024-04-12/">Fed rate cut bets fading</a>, investors may remain reluctant to pile in.</p>
<p>They may instead be eyeing up opportunities in the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/">shitcoin</a> markets.</p>
<p>On-chain markets refer to the market for tokens that are issued directly onto blockchains like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>. The name ‚Äúshitcoin‚Äù refer to the fact that most of these tokens are scams, pump-and-dumps, or lacking in real utility.</p>
<p>But on-chain shitcoin markets are also one of the only places where traders are able to secure gains of 10x or more in under 24 hours.</p>
<p>Here are the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be watching, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, potential investors should always do their own research into tokens and never risk more than they can afford to lose.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Crypto Gainers Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>42 times 10 (420)</strong></h3>
<p>A just-launched meme coin called 42 times 10 (420) is up 1,750% on Friday, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x6ccbd352db737f2c7cb76e451ba636054df85a77?t=1712962337585">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these big gains, the token‚Äôs market cap was last around $150,000, with only around $40,000 in liquidity.</p>
<p>The token also still has less than 100 holders and only saw $28,000 in trading volumes over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>As per DEXTools‚Äô smart contract audit, the token has three concerning aspects to its smart contract. Traders should be very careful with this highly illiquid shitcoin.</p>
<h3><strong>WojakPepe (WOPE)</strong></h3>
<p>A new hybrid version of the Pepe and Wojak meme coins called WojakPepe (WOPE) is up 550% on Friday.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x35c29fd797928b5cfc9206625707be41751f424c?t=1712962341702">DEXTools</a>, who puts the token‚Äôs market cap at $1 million and liquidity at $100,000.</p>
<p>The token last had just over 550 holders and 24 hour trading volumes of $6,2 million. Not bad for a first day of trade.</p>
<p>That being said, the token has two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools.</p>
<p>The utility of the token also isn‚Äôt clear. So traders should be very cautious with this shitcoin.</p>
<h3><strong>pepcoin (PEP)</strong></h3>
<p>A new meme coin claimed to be the ‚Äúretard cousin ov Pepe‚Äù called pepcoin (PEP) is up 1,150% on Friday.</p>
<p>But, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x9334df2f07742245fef27f0ff9c6d65963f19628?t=1712962344798">DEXTools</a>, it market cap was last only around $60,000 with $25,000 in liquidity and 220 holders.</p>
<p>That means a very small volume of sales could trigger a huge price crash. Traders should be very cautious of such an illiquid coin.</p>
<h2><strong>A Better Way to Make Quick Gains</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shitcoins offer the prospect of quick gains, but are very risky. That‚Äôs not just due to their illiquidity and volatility. Its also due to the fact that most are scams of some sort, or pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<p>A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>Up-and-coming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-web3/">web3</a> projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development.</p>
<p>If crypto investors can identify project‚Äôs with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction.</p>
<p>But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first.</p>
<p>Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects.</p>
<p>Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.</p>

With <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/xrp-price-prediction/">XRP</a> now sharply below its major moving averages, focus is turning to a test of a long-term uptrend.</p>
<p>Indeed, the XRP price has followed an uptrend going all the way back to its early 2023 lows.</p>
<p>Should this uptrend break, a short-term retest of support in the $0.43-46 area. Even a break under $0.40 could be on the cards.</p>

<p>Of course, assuming the broader market is in a bullish phase, such a dip would probably be bought into.</p>
<p>But whether a recovery to $1 is incoming remains difficult to predict.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-pumps-16-eyes-test-of-yearly-highs-near-1-0-as-crypto-community-discusses-potential-99-9-victory-for-ripple-versus-sec.htm">Ripple Labs maintains winning momentum</a> in its lawsuit versus the SEC. A judge ruled last year that Ripple Labs‚Äô sales of XRP didn‚Äôt necessarily constitute a security transaction.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html">Ripple Labs predicts that its winning momentum will encourage banks to begin using its XRP</a>-powered global payments solution.</p>
<p>That could substantially boost XRP‚Äôs adoption. That being said, concerns remain about XRP‚Äôs lack of decentralization.</p>
<p>Moreover, many are concerned that XRP lacks a major use case, when compared to other major cryptocurrencies, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/%5d">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>.</p>
<p>The former is increasingly viewed as digital gold, while the latter two are fast-growing smart-contract blockchains and the homes of fast-growing decentralized finance and application ecosystems.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
XRP investors would be right to be concerned about the cryptocurrency‚Äôs near-term price risks.</p>
<p>Sometimes traders hunting quick gains often turn to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-best-shitcoins-buy-like-elon-musk-dogecoin.htm">shitcoin</a> markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<p>A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>Up-and-coming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-web3/">web3</a> projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development.</p>
<p>If crypto investors can identify project‚Äôs with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction.</p>
<p>But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first.</p>
<p>Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects.</p>
<p>Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has received a nod from a Federal Court to appoint receivers for digital assets held by a group of collapsed crypto mining companies and their sole owners.</p>
<h2><strong>ASIC Takes Action Against Collapsed Crypto Mining Companies</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
ASIC launched civil proceedings against three crypto-mining firms, collectively known as NGS Companies. The proceedings also included the directors of these mining schemes: Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have commenced civil proceedings against <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blockchain</a> mining companies NGS Crypto, NGS Digital and NGS Group ‚Äì and their directors ‚Äì for allegedly providing financial services without a licence <a href="https://t.co/Hgwk81V5TD">https://t.co/Hgwk81V5TD</a> <a href="https://t.co/XpKcXCBZxt">pic.twitter.com/XpKcXCBZxt</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ASIC Media (@asicmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/asicmedia/status/1778619570514780241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-073mr-asic-obtains-federal-court-orders-appointing-receivers-over-digital-currency-assets-of-blockchain-mining-companies/">According to a Friday statement from ASIC</a>, the court order also restrained Brett Mendham from traveling outside Australia. The regulator applied for these orders because it thinks investors in these crypto-mining schemes ‚Äúare at risk of dissipation.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Mining Collapse Leaves Investors $41 Million in the Red</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto mining firms collapsed into liquidation owing 450 investors more than USD $41 million. The companies allegedly targeted investors to establish self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and then converted them into cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>‚ÄúASIC alleges in the proceedings that the NGS Companies contravened section 911A of the Corporations Act by providing financial services without an Australian financial services license,‚Äù the release read.</p>
<p>The regulator is now holding the companies accountable for illegally marketing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-mining-rigs/">investment products backed by crypto mining</a>.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo warned investors to consider risks before using their SMSF to invest in crypto-related investments like mining.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinized by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h2><strong>Three Other Crypto Funds Thrust Into Liquidation in Australia</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In addition to NGS Companies, fellow crypto funds in Australia ‚Äì DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund ‚Äì have been forced into liquidation.</p>
<p>Following a collapse of these crypto funds all within a week, the schemes potentially owe more than $150 million to investors. A Federal Court has appointed liquidators from KordaMentha to the three firms operated by Balanian that offered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-to-buy/">cryptocurrency investments</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, liquidators are tasked to investigate and uncover more investors. Despite the allegations, the Balanian team has yet to respond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Prominent author of "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," Robert Kiyosaki, stated on April 12 that he would never participate in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Bitcoin spot prices or in any other "Wall Street financial products."</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 12, Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of &#8220;Rich Dad, Poor Dad,&#8221; expressed his lack of interest in investing in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and any other &#8220;Wall Street financial products.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Times best-selling author, who has been a stoic supporter of Bitcoin over the years, noted that he favors direct ownership of physical assets due to his entrepreneurship pathway.</p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Claims Bitcoin ETFs Are For Institutions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1778640352444084425">In an X article</a>, Robert Kiyosaki shared his opinion that spot Bitcoin ETFs and other asset-backed &#8220;ETFs are best for most people and institutions.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Q:  Will you buy the Bitcoin ETF?<br />A:  No. Just as I own gold and silver coin and mines and own apartment houses I do not own gold or silver ETFs or REITS, real estate ETFS. ETFs are best for most people and institutions. Personally I am an entrepreneur and prefer to stay as far‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1778640352444084425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Having invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, and real estate, which he said are bargains today, Kiyosaki is sticking to his guns. He believes in making his own financial moves that align with his entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>However, the renowned author reiterated that investors should always choose what is best for them, noting that his stance against Bitcoin ETFs works best for him. If he makes a mistake, he has no one else to blame but himself, he noted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETFs market is at an all-time high, with tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) picking up pace.</p>
<p><a href="https://etp.coinshares.com/knowledge/market-activity/fund-flows-08-04-24">CoinShares data showed</a> that cryptocurrency investment products, including Bitcoin ETFs, have recorded positive inflows of late. Total inflows were $646 million on April 8, and the year-to-date (YTD) inflow was $13.8B, the highest volume ever recorded.</p>

<p>Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, predicted an upward shift towards the tokenization of RWAs, such as bonds issued on blockchains, <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1778043230115738061">during a Chainalysis Links Conference held in New York</a>.</p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Endorses Cathie Woods BTC Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The remarks of Robert Kiyosaki, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robert-kiyosaki-recommends-bitcoin-backs-michael-saylor.htm">who has always been bullish on Bitcoin</a>, came on the heels of the bullish price prediction made by Cathie Woods, the founder of Ark Invest asset management firm, who has been optimistic about the prospect of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-btc-etf-approval-will-encourage-more-institutions-to-invest-in-bitcoin-cathie-wood.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs encouraging institutions to invest in Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>During the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22, Wood stated that the BTC price could soar to $2.3M per token.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: &quot;Cathie Wood guarantees <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> will hit <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b5.png" alt="üíµ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> $2.3M per <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a>. </p>
<p>Do I believe her? Yes I do. </p>
<p>Cathie Wood is very smart. I trust her opinion,&quot; says Robert Kiyosaki. <a href="https://t.co/GpHokUfd6N">pic.twitter.com/GpHokUfd6N</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1778430301661725134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While Wood&#8217;s prediction generated criticism for being unreasonable, <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1778265859355820228">Kiyosaki praised her</a> and highlighted his trust in her opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kathie Wood guarantees Bitcoin will hit $2.3 million per BTC. Do I believe her? Yes, I do. Kathie Wood is very smart. I trust her opinion,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Could she be wrong? Yes, she could be. So what? The more important question is &#8216;What do you believe?&#8217; What if Kathie is right? What if Kathie is wrong? And most importantly, &#8216;How many Bitcoin do you own?&#8217; If Kathie is right, I will wish I bought more.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Kiyosaki and Cathie Wood might disagree on ETFs, they both see immense potential in Bitcoin. Their optimism sparks discussions about the asset&#8217;s future trajectory and place in the investment space.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no surprise then that cryptocurrency prices came under pressure ‚Äì many investors deem <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins">cryptocurrencies</a> as a high beta risk assets.</p>
<h2><strong>Altcoins Bear the Brunt as Cryptocurrency Prices Dump</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Friday sell-off in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/%5d">Bitcoin</a> was decidedly mild compared to that of many major altcoins.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/toncoin/">Toncoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> all dropped between 10-16% in 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogwifhat/">Dogwifhat</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bonk/">Bonk</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-seeks-dao-approval-for-400-million-gaming-ecosystem-fund.htm">Arbitrum</a> were amongst the worst-performing names in the top 100 by market capitalization.</p>
<p>Friday‚Äôs carnage saw open interest in altcoin cryptocurrencies slashed by 30%.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That comes after $770 million in leveraged long crypto futures positions were wiped out on Friday, as per <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">coinglass.com data</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_197990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-197990" style="width: 1125px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-197990" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12205919/1712955558-screenshot-2024-04-12-155431.png" alt="Cryptocurrency prices dumped on Friday as leverage long futures position liquidations spiked / Source: coinglass.com" width="1125" height="476" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12205919/1712955558-screenshot-2024-04-12-155431.png 1125w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12205919/1712955558-screenshot-2024-04-12-155431-300x127.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12205919/1712955558-screenshot-2024-04-12-155431-1024x433.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12205919/1712955558-screenshot-2024-04-12-155431-768x325.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12205919/1712955558-screenshot-2024-04-12-155431-150x63.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-197990" class="wp-caption-text">Cryptocurrency prices dumped on Friday as leverage long futures position liquidations spiked / Source: coinglass.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the aforementioned altcoins are at least 25% down from recent highs.</p>
<p>Some, like Arbitrum and Bonk, are down over 50% from yearly highs.</p>
<p>Indeed, it had already been an ugly few weeks for most alternative cryptocurrency prices, even prior to Friday‚Äôs sharp.</p>
<p>After a strong finish to 2023/start to 2024 that saw many major altcoins posting 2-3x or more gains, as well as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> recovering to new record highs, momentum has stalled, and profit-taking has taken over.</p>
<p>Jitters about a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> related turbulence, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/inflation-still-too-high-fed-cut-interest-rates-schmid-says-2024-04-12/">fading Fed rate cut bets</a> and geopolitics have added fresh reasons to derisk.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Next For Cryptocurrency Prices?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It remains far too early to say definitively that the latest drop in cryptocurrency prices is over.</p>
<p>After all, there remains plenty of room left for escalation between Iran and Israel.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/">altcoin</a> pullback presents a great opportunity for investors to get in at bargain prices versus a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>But anyone jumping into the market now should be ready for significant two-way volatility.</p>
<p>Or, if they fancy buying a crypto that carries a much lower risk of near-term 15% intra-day moves, there‚Äôs Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yes, Bitcoin has dropped 5% in 24 hours on risk off flows. But trading in the $67,000s, BTC is only down 8% from the record highs it hit near $74,000 last month.</p>
<p>Moreover, it remains locked well within recent ranges.</p>
<p>That could reflect the fact that many view Bitcoin to actually be a safe haven asset, much like gold.</p>
<p>And its general resilience in recent weeks could reflect a reluctance to sell ahead of the halving/amid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-etfs/">ETF optimism</a>.</p>
<p>While a article-halving ‚Äúsell-the-fact‚Äù reaction could see Bitcoin dip back towards the $60,000s, its outlook remains strong.</p>
<p>Prior halvings have typically been followed by huge price run-ups to fresh record levels within a few months.</p>
<p>Big US deficit spending and global central bank easing suggests that macro will remain a tailwind. That‚Äôs even if the Fed is comparatively slow to begin cutting rates, amid robust US data.</p>
<p>And finally, institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has added a new, long-term source of buy pressure to the market.</p>
<p>$100,000 Bitcoin for later this year remains very much on the cards.</p>

<p>And that suggests that, while the near-term altcoin outlook is bumpy, traders should brace for strong comebacks later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist claiming to be Bitcoin&#8217;s creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has dropped his appeal in a Norwegian defamation case against the well-known Bitcoiner Hodlonaut (a.k.a. Marcus Granath), according to a statement released on X Thursday.</p>
<h2><strong>Marcus Granath Celebrates As Norway Appeal Is Dropped</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Granath first found himself in legal hot water with Wright when he took issue with a series of now-deleted March 2019 X posts referring to the so-called </span><span>Bitcoin inventor</span><span> as a ‚Äúfraud,‚Äù ‚Äúmentally ill,‚Äù and a ‚Äúpathetic scammer.‚Äù</span><span></span></p>
<p>By that summer, the London-based Wright had filed a defamation lawsuit against Granath in the U.K.¬†<span>Around the same time, Granath filed a lawsuit in his native Norway alleging that his judgements against Wright were fully compatible with the law.</span><span></span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In October 2022, a Norwegian court ruled in Granath‚Äôs favor, in part claiming that Wright had insufficient evidence to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/who-created-bitcoin/"><span>verifiably prove he was Satoshi Nakamoto</span></a><span>.</span><span></span></p>

<h2>Craig Wright Is Not Satoshi Nakamoto, London High Court Rules</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>News of Wright‚Äôs failed Norwegian appeal comes just two months after London‚Äôs High Court found the alleged Australian fraudster to have lied about being the inventor of Bitcoin in a case filed by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) challenging his claims.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Justice Mellor found that:<br />1) Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.<br />2) Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.<br />3) Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System.<br />4) Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.<br />1/4</p>
<p>&mdash; COPA (@opencryptoorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/opencryptoorg/status/1768286022083727392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúFor over eight years, Dr. Wright and his financial backers have lied about his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto and used that lie to bully and intimidate developers in the bitcoin community,‚Äù COPA posted to their X account shortly after the ruling. ‚ÄúThat ends today with the court‚Äôs ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>In fact, a recent linguistic analysis of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s writing shows that the enigmatic founding father of crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/investigation-reveals-bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-could-group-not-an-individual.htm">may be a collective group</a>, not just one individual.</p>
<p><span>Shortly after the ruling, <a href="https://bitcoindefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/COPA-v-Wright-WFO-Approved-Judgment-28.03.2024.pdf">UK Judge James Mellor froze the entirety of Wright‚Äôs assets</a> after he attempted to transfer several of his London firm‚Äôs shares to a Singapore-based entity, potentially in a bid to evade financial penalties related to the case.¬†</span></p>
<p>Despite Granath&#8217;s latest victory, Wright&#8217;s original libel lawsuit against him remains open in the UK. It&#8217;s unclear when or if they will return to court for this case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>The global stablecoin supply currently stands at </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins"><span>over $150 billion</span></a><span>, demonstrating new demand for relatively stable digital assets.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>The stablecoin market has also grown more competitive. For example, XRP issuer Ripple recently </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-stablecoin-launch-this-year-boost-xrp-adoption.htm"><span>announced plans to </span><span>launch a United States dollar-backed stablecoin</span></a><span>.¬†</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Launching a stablecoin is a natural step for Ripple as we bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto.

<p>&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1775873645044486171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin will likely compete with the two most dominant stablecoin issuers, </span><span>Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). The supply of </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether"><span>Tether&#8217;s USDT </span></a><span>and </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdc"><span>Circle&#8217;s USDC</span></a><span> expanded by nearly $10 billion combined over the past month.¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>Is The Bull Market Driving Stablecoin Demand?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Interestingly, increasing demand for stablecoins coincides with the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-market-cap-hits-1-39-trillion-time-to-buy-or-sell.htm"><span>current crypto bull market</span></a><span>.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Yet while stablecoin growth may be correlated with increasing cryptocurrency prices, </span><span>industry experts believe demand for digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar are surging for other reasons.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Austin Campbell, Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, told Cryptonews that while there is a correlation between stablecoins and the wider crypto market cap, it has been declining over time.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt appears that stablecoins are being used independently of crypto trading for payments,‚Äù said Campbell.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>He added that dollar-backed stablecoins are addressing a broader market segment compared to digital assets solely used for speculation.</span></p>
<h2><b>Stablecoin Use Cases For Payments On The Rise</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Their utility may be increasing as well, as a number of stablecoin payment use cases are coming to fruition.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>For ex</span><span>ample, David Uhryniak, Head of TRON Ecosystem Development, told Cryptonews that an app called Grab ‚Äì known as the ‚ÄúUber of Singapore‚Äù ‚Äì recently began accepting USDT on TRON for payments.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúTRC20-USDT holders can now pay for their rides or food delivery directly without converting to fiat currency,‚Äù said Uhryniak. ‚ÄúI expect a growing trend where more international e-commerce platforms will integrate with TRON to accept crypto transactions for everyday services.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>According to Uh</span><span>ryniak, the TRON blockchain ha</span><span>s become one of the preferred transport layers for popular stablecoins like USDT due to its low transaction fees and fast processing.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúTRON has the highest circulating supply of USDT, at over $54.8 billion,‚Äù said Uhryniak. ‚ÄúSince early February of this year, USDT on TRON has been averaging over 2 million</span><a href="https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1772942737903427716?s=20"><span> transactions daily</span></a><span>.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Jelena Djuric, CEO and Co-Founder of digital asset issuance chain Noble, told Cryptonews that while stableco</span><span>ins can be </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/navigating-the-world-of-defi-swaps-evolution-and-the-future.htm"><span>used for decentralized finance (DeFi)</span></a><span>, th</span><span>e platform has recently seen a surge in stablecoins for payments.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúAn example of this is being seen with Cypher Wallet, where users can load USDC from Noble and spend those dollars in stores wherever Mastercard is accepted,‚Äù said Djuric.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Djuric added that she believes the most interesting stablecoin use cases currently focus on digital dollars.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúStablecoins are more convenient, efficient and scalable than the traditional financial rails,‚Äù she said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Djuric shared that Noble is currently handling $1 billion of volume per month of USDC transactions from the platform to other Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol chains.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe have grown USDC issuance more than most other native issuance chains for the past few months. This represents real adoption by users and Dapp chains that plug into Noble for liquidity,‚Äù said Djuric.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Massimiliano Silenzi, CEO of research firm Cryptorefills Labs, told Cryptonews that recent </span><a href="https://cryptorefills.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/report/2024/Cryptorefills_Stablecoins_Report_2024.pdf"><span>findings from Cryptorefills show</span></a><span> almost 80 percent of crypto-shoppers prefer to pay for goods and services with stablecoins versus other cryptocurrencies.</span></p>

<p><span>While notable, Silenzi pointed out that due to transaction speeds and fees, only one-sixth of stablecoin payments take place on the Ethereum mainnet.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe majority of stablecoin payments are dispersed fairly evenly across alternative networks like Polygon, TRON, Solana, and Avalanche as well as Ethereum layer-2s like Optimism and Arbitrum,‚Äù said Silenzi. ‚ÄúAs a result, when it comes to stablecoin payment networks that are quick, inexpensive, and scalable, there isn&#8217;t yet a clear winner.‚Äù</span></p>
<h2><b>Challenges May Hamper Stablecoin Adoption</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>While it‚Äôs notable that stablecoin adoption may be increasing due to real-world payment use cases, regulations and other concerns may slow adoption.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, while </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-ceo-jeremy-allaire-expects-us-to-pass-stablecoin-legislation-in-2024.htm"><span>stablecoin legislation may get passed this year in the U.S.</span></a><span>, </span><span>Senator Elizabeth Warren recen</span><span>tly criticized the proposed stablecoin bill.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senator-elizabeth-warren-slams-push-for-stablecoin-bill-cites-national-security-risks.htm"><span>Cryptonews previously reported</span></a><span>, Warren argues that creating new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins could ‚Äúamplify and entrench‚Äù risks they pose to the American banking sector.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, David Pope, Commissioner of The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, </span><span>told Cryptonews that tax rules around stablecoins remain a barrier to adoption as well.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe IRS views all crypto (including Stablecoins) as property (as opposed to cash),‚Äù said Pope. ‚ÄúThis means whenever a US person or entity uses a stablecoin for anything, it has to be reported on their tax return (even though there is normally no gain or loss).‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Pope believes that if stablecoins become commonly used, this will likely result in thousands of transactions needing to be documented.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to regulations, Djuric believes that non-crypto natives still struggle with Web3 concepts such as private keys, wallets, on-ramps, bridged versions of the same stablecoins, and more.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúNoble is trying to solve all of these challenges, but it doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. Eventually, we should see chain and asset abstraction as secure but highly intuitive wallet interfaces,‚Äù she said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, these challenges may eventually lead to decreasing demand in stablecoins.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, </span><a href="https://paxos.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PYUSD-Monthly-Stablecoin-Reporting-March-2024-PYUSD-Disclosure.pdf"><span>Paxos‚Äô most recent transparency report on PayPal USD</span></a><span> noted the circulation of PYUSD in March totaled $188.5 million. This marks a 39% decrease in PayPal‚Äôs stablecoin compared to the previous month.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ways To Ensure Stablecoin Growth Moving Forward</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Challenges aside, Campbell believes that stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto space matures.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúStablecoins will probably outgrow DeFi and become a tool for real-world payments around the globe,‚Äù he said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Although adoption may be slow, education, along with retail demand for stablecoins, will ensure growth in the future.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Notably, Tether is already taking steps to provide better stablecoin education.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>On April 10, Tether announced a partnership with Coins.ph ‚Äì</span><span> a popular digital asset exchange in the Philippines ‚Äì to promote financial education for blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and stablecoins in the region.</span></p>
<p><span>According to a Tether </span><a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-and-coinsph-collaborate-on-blockchain-education-initiative-in-the-philippines/"><span>blog article</span></a><span>, the educational initiatives being launched will target diverse segments of the Filipino population. This includes finance professionals like bankers and fintech companies, but also overseas Filipino workers seeking efficient remittance solutions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Pope also believes that as the general public moves through the learning curve, retail demand for stablecoins will increase.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThis all suggests that stablecoins are slowly being adopted,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut can anyone buy their cup of morning coffee with them yet? Probably very few places accept a wallet transfer for that, but adoption does seem to be moving along.‚Äù</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong is expected to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs as early as Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter, marking a big step for the cryptocurrency industry in the region.</p>
<p>Harvest Fund Management, along with Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital, is anticipated to receive approval for its spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications.</p>
<p>By the end of April, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hong-kong-set-approve-its-first-spot-bitcoin-etfs-april-sources-say-2024-04-10/">ETFs are expected to receive the green light</a> from the Securities and Future Commissions (SFC). Additionally, the SFC is reportedly collaborating with Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd to finalize the approval process.</p>
<p>While the exact timeline is unknown, sources suggest that the initial approvals, which may include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-poised-to-unveil-first-spot-bitcoin-etfs-on-april-15.htm">Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs</a>, could occur as soon as Monday.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Regulators based in the cities have already approved the launch of crypto-based ETFs. CSOP Ether Futures, Samsung Bitcoin Futures, and CSOP Bitcoin Futures collectively hold an estimated value of $170 million.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETFs Show Strong Inflows Since Launch</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the year began, Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to a resurgence in the cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>By mid-April, the total assets under management for the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/etfs/funds-bitcoin/">11 ETFs</a> are projected to reach a record $73 billion, with $59 billion raised to date. The net flows into Blackrock&#8217;s iSharesBitcoin Trust have exceeded $15 billion in just three months.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this week, Harvest was expected to get approval to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the city. Both Harvest and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/CHASSZ:CH">China Asset Management</a> were given approval by the SFC to supply virtual asset fund management services on April 9.</p>
<h2>Regulators Working to Allow Investors to Buy Spot ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Julia Leung, deputy chief executive director of intermediaries for the SFC, stated the regulator was ‚Äúactively seeking to set up a regime to approve ETFs that provide investor guarails for airstream virtual assets‚Äù.</p>
<p>Hong Kong‚Äôs crypto appeal had encountered a problem in the form of JPEX, an unlicensed crypto exchange responsible for an alleged $1.6 million in fraud. However, authorities still continue to show ambitions to support crypto entrepreneurs in hopes of restoring the city&#8217;s reputationas a global business center.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), led by Sarah Cardell, has voiced its displeasure with the control of AI Foundation Models (FMs) by a small number of tech companies. This concern was outlined in a paper presented by Cardell during an Antitrust Law Spring Meeting in Washington on April 11.</p>
<h2><strong>UK Competition and Markets Authority Concerned over Potential Market Exploitation</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cardell, head of the regulatory body, has expressed concern that Big Tech investments in the artificial intelligence sector could stifle competition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We‚Äôre committed to applying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at our disposal ‚Äì now and in the future ‚Äì to ensure that this transformational and structurally critical technology delivers on its promise,‚Äù Cardell explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-outlines-growing-concerns-in-markets-for-ai-foundation-models">According to the CMA boss</a>, there&#8217;s an ‚Äúinterconnected web of over 90 partnerships and strategic investments involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia (the leading supplier of AI accelerator chips).‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We‚Äôve outlined our growing concerns in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AI</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/foundationmodels?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#foundationmodels</a> market, including 3 key interlinked risks to fair, open and effective competition. </p>
<p>Read more about these, as well as our plans for further action, here: <a href="https://t.co/pP2larduqN">https://t.co/pP2larduqN</a> <a href="https://t.co/YeShd28aUH">pic.twitter.com/YeShd28aUH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Competition &amp; Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1778434517516128391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The concern is regarding the impact of these investments on customer choice and healthy competition within the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/ai-crypto-coins/">rapidly growing AI sector</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA chief outlines three specific dangers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control over inputs</strong>: Big Tech could gain control of essential AI inputs like data and specialized chips.</li>
<li><strong>Limiting choice</strong>: Companies could leverage existing market power to limit user options for AI services.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-competitive alliances</strong>: These tech giants could form partnerships explicitly to concentrate market power and hinder innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Big Tech Firms Invest Massively In Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-commits-2-billion-in-funding-to-ai-startup-anthropic-db4d4c50">Google have invested billions in AI development</a>, hiring top talent and building products for vast user bases.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s backing of OpenAI (the creators of ChatGPT and leading model GPT-4) is a prime example. These investments, while fueling progress, also solidify their positions as gatekeepers within the industry.</p>
<p>The CMA recognizes the potential benefits of AI and the expertise these corporations possess. However, Cardell worries that smaller companies could be squeezed out if the current trend continues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Leading U.S. lawmakers from the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Thursday afternoon to discuss their long-awaited stablecoin bill.</span></p>
<h2>House Financial Services Committee Reps. Meet With Senator Chuck Schumer</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span><a href="https://x.com/BrendanPedersen/status/1778537586547663195">According to Punchbowl News</a>, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) were seen entering Schumer‚Äôs office on April 11 to pitch their yet-to-be-released stablecoin bill proposal. </span></p>
<p><span>Reports say McHenry and Waters discussed linking their stablecoin reform to the upcoming funding reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in hopes of securing bipartisan support.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEWS: The two top lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this afternoon to discuss stablecoin reform. Lawmakers discussed whether the FAA reauthorization could be a potential vehicle for bipartisan legislation. PBN text out now. <a href="https://t.co/Abcb6H7nGy">pic.twitter.com/Abcb6H7nGy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Brendan Pedersen (@BrendanPedersen) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanPedersen/status/1778537586547663195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Should the forthcoming stablecoin bill be tacked on to the FAA reauthorization, Punchbowl News reports that the strategy would be ‚Äúfairly unprecedented in financial services policy.‚Äù</span></p>
<h2>The Long Journey To A Stablecoin Bill</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>McHenry has long advocated for stablecoin reform, going so far as to draft the yet-to-be-approved ‚ÄúClarity for Payment Stablecoins Act‚Äù in 2023. </span><span>If passed, McHenry‚Äôs bill would see stablecoins face <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-regulations/">regulatory oversight</a> similar to that of the traditional finance sector. </span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) are planning to unveil new stablecoin legislation that would ‚Äúweed out bad actors while still promoting growth and innovation‚Äù as early as this week. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2024/04/09/a-new-stablecoin-bill-could-be-introduced-in-us-senate-this-week/?sh=4193b71916a1">According to a recent Forbes report</a>, the upcoming legislation would allow federal and state depository institutions to become stablecoin issuers while non-depository institutions would be overseen by the federal government yet regulated at the state level.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe bill is a product of common sense compromise,‚Äù Gillibrand said, claiming it would ‚Äúhelp drive innovation in the cryptocurrency landscape.‚Äù</span></p>
<h2>Lawmakers Face Pushback From Senator Elizabeth Warren</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Despite the strong push for stablecoin reform on Capitol Hill, not all U.S. lawmakers are thrilled by the idea. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Elizabeth Warren&#39;s letter to Congress highlights concerns about stablecoin risks and the need for strong anti-money laundering measures.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Just this week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote to McHenry and Waters to discuss the potential risks of passing such legislation without effective anti-money laundering laws in place.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúPolicymakers should be weary of efforts to integrate stablecoins into the formal banking system ‚Äì or extend any of the concomitant safety net protections to stablecoin issuers ‚Äì without strong rules that ensure safety and soundness,‚Äù the letter states. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-criticizes-crypto-says-it-threatens-u-s-security.htm">Warren, who has built a staunch anti-crypto reputation</a>, is still attempting to advance the ‚ÄúDigital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act‚Äù (DAAMLA) since she first proposed it in 2022.</p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIf we are going to create new on ramps, increasing traffic, which is exactly what the House bill does, then we need a regulatory framework that will put the rules for Anti-Money Laundering in place so that we do not have more opportunities for Iran and terrorists and drug lords and human traffickers to make more money,‚Äù she said.</span></p>
<p>It is currently unclear when McHenry and Waters will present the finalized version of their stablecoin bill, but many believe it will be sooner rather than later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As blue-chip cryptocurrencies consolidate within recent ranges, with Bitcoin (BTC) continuing to swing either side of $70,000, traders and investors are looking for the best crypto to buy now in the altcoin market that might offer the prospect of quick gains.</p>
<p>Major cryptocurrencies have been indecisive this week as traders weigh various themes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/%5d">Bitcoin</a>, last trading in the upper $68,000s, has swing between lows around $67,500 and highs around $72,500 this week.</p>
<p>Traders continue to monitor themes such as easing GBTC outflows, the prospect of near-term <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-poised-to-unveil-first-spot-bitcoin-etfs-on-april-15.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-more-than-expected-march-2024-04-10/#:~:text=Economists%20polled%20by%20Reuters%20had,has%20a%202%25%20inflation%20target.">hotter-than-expected US economic data</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-williams-said-outlook-uncertain-data-will-drive-rate-decisions-2024-04-11/">pushing back on Fed rate cut bets</a> and next week‚Äôs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">halving</a> event.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are some nerves about a short-term dip in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> market in wake of the halving. But technicals paint a bullish picture for BTC.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has been consistently posting higher lows in recent weeks. Meanwhile, its price has continued to top out in the low $70,000s.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin to $80,000 Next?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
That means Bitcoin has been forming a bullish ascending triangle structure. Such structures generally form ahead of bullish breakouts.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin is to break convincingly to the north of its current 2024 highs near-$74,000, $80,000 could be next.</p>

<p>The bears could regain control and send Bitcoin back to the low $60,000s or even $50,000s. But such a retracement wouldn‚Äôt snap the thesis that BTC remains in a bull market.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, within a few months of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">halving</a>, Bitcoin has always pumped to new record highs.</p>
<p>Add to that picture that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-demand-to-rise-on-the-back-of-inflation-says-grayscale.htm">US continues to run a big deficit</a>, that rate cuts are coming sooner or later, that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etfs-anticipated-to-attract-220-billion-in-three-years.htm">ETF demand</a> should continue to act as a long-term tailwind, and that the 2024 Presidential election could see the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/if-trump-wins-he-plans-free-wall-street-burdensome-regulations-2024-04-12/">US political and regulatory landscape shift in a more pro-crypto direction</a>, $100,000 remains on the cards for later this year.</p>
<p>For investors looking to get involved in crypto, Bitcoin has to be one of the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p>But some investors looking for bigger than 2x potential gains will be looking to smaller, lesser-known <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/">altcoins</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-are-altcoins/">altcoins</a> could article gains of as much as 5-10x this bull market.</p>
<p>Here are some strong performers on Friday that could be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>BitTorrent (BTT)</strong></h3>
<p>BitTorrent (BTT) is one of the few cryptos trading in the green on Friday as the BTC price turns lower.</p>
<p>It was last up 6.5% in 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bittorrent-new/">CoinMarketCap</a>, and trading in the $0.0000015s.</p>
<p>And BTT‚Äôs gains could be able to accelerate. The cryptocurrency appears to have formed an ascending triangle. A break above resistance could see it pump higher towards $0.0000022.</p>
<figure id="attachment_197917" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-197917" style="width: 814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-197917" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12173048/1712943048-screenshot-2024-04-12-120256.png" alt="BTT‚Äôs gains could be able to accelerate, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. " width="814" height="729" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12173048/1712943048-screenshot-2024-04-12-120256.png 814w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12173048/1712943048-screenshot-2024-04-12-120256-300x269.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12173048/1712943048-screenshot-2024-04-12-120256-768x688.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12173048/1712943048-screenshot-2024-04-12-120256-150x134.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-197917" class="wp-caption-text">BTT‚Äôs gains could be able to accelerate, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a result, in a broadly bearish market, BTT could be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h3><strong>Cronos (CRO)</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto.com‚Äôs EVM-compatible blockchain Cronos (CRO) is another crypto holding up well on Friday.</p>
<p>It was last trading with gains of roughly 2% in the past 24 hours near $0.15, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cronos/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Its low market cap of under $4 billion, despite its link to one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges, suggests plenty of room left for growth this bull market.</p>
<p>With 5x gains possible, CRO could be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h3><strong>BNB (BNB) </strong></h3>
<p>The world‚Äôs fourth-largest crypto BNB (BNB) is another strong performer on Friday, also up 2% in 24 hours.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">CoinMarketCap</a>, BNB was last trading just above $610, with its market cap hovering around $91.5 billion.</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin, BNB is forming an ascending triangle and could be about to pump higher. Its record highs around $700 could soon come into play.</p>
<figure id="attachment_197918" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-197918" style="width: 820px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-197918" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12173141/1712943100-screenshot-2024-04-12-122005.png" alt="Like Bitcoin, BNB is forming an ascending triangle and could be about to pump higher.

Its record highs around $700 could soon come into play. It could thus be the best crypto to buy now / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>BNB could thus be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer investors the opportunity to potentially make quick gains.</p>
<p>But some traders are on the lookout for much faster gains than major altcoins can offer.</p>
<p>These traders often turn to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/5-best-shitcoins-buy-like-elon-musk-dogecoin.htm">shitcoin</a> markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<p>A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>Up-and-coming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-web3/">web3</a> projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development.</p>
<p>If crypto investors can identify project‚Äôs with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction.</p>
<p>But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first.</p>
<p>Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects.</p>
<p>Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>The first quarter of 2024 saw a major increase in demand for complex crypto products due to the crypto bull market, according to reports from various exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitget-transparency-report-q1-2024">Bitget‚Äôs Q1 2024 Report</a> shows a 100% surge</span><span> in spot and futures trading transaction volume, topping $1.4 trillion and $160 billion, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>The surge represents a substantial growth from the $658 billion in futures trading volume and $59 billion in spot trading volume, </span><span>respectively</span><span>, in Q1 of 2023.¬†</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúFebruary saw a robust market recovery, with Bitcoin soaring to unprecedented heights,‚Äù the Bitget report said. Together with the buzz around Solana and advancements in the AI sector, this underscored the market‚Äôs dynamic nature.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span>During Q1 2024, the market exchange introduced 186 new tokens, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogwifhat-price-prediction-as-wif-reaches-4-billion-market-cap-can-wif-overtake-dogecoin.htm">Dogwifhat (WIF)</a>, Solana meme coin, and rollup utility token Altayler (ALT), which experienced a major pump of over 1,000% article-listing.¬†</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cutting edge AI token Bittensor (TAO) has fallen 20%¬† in 24 hours to trade at $572, only a day after listing on Binance in what looks like &#8220;buy the rumour, sell the news&#8221; trading activity, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittensor">data</a> by Coin Gecko.</p>
<p>Bittensor is a pioneering peer-to-peer (p2p) machine learning protocol that incentivizes participants to train machine learners across a global decentralized network of nodes.</p>
<p>By spreading the computing load across multiple nodes, the Bittensor team hopes to create a collaborative and open-source AI training ecosystem that will rival the more centralized machine learning systems used by corporations like Google and IBM.</p>
<p>Bittensor employs a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. PoI is an alternative to Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-Work (PoW) model, where the nodes with the most computing power validate the most transactions and mine the most BTC.</p>
<p>It also differs to the Proof-of-Stake model used by Ethereum, where the nodes that staked the most ETH validate the most transactions.</p>
<p>Bittensor is currently the number one <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/artificial-intelligence">AI-related cryptocurrency</a> with a market cap of nearly $4 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of just over $230k.</p>
<h2>Is it too late to buy AI token Bittensor (TAO)?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Given the sudden price drop, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to buy TAO.</p>
<p>TAO is frontrunning an AI token sector that will rise to prominence in the coming years once tech companies in jurisdictions across the world are confident about both crypto and AI regulation.</p>
<p>In fact, some would argue the depreciation is welcome because it offers new buyers a chance to get in at a discount ahead of a potential future rally.</p>
<p>However, Bittensor&#8217;s trading chart has followed a slightly different narrative to more mainstream cryptocurrencies over the last three months.</p>
<p>While, broadly speaking, the price has gone up over the period examined, it has not moved in tandem with the rest of the market.</p>
<p>According to the trading chart, the transition from February to March was more volatile for TAO than more leading cryptocurrencies. Having said that, the token has found strong support around $600 and is only trading 22% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of <span>$757.60 set a month ago, March 8.¬†</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_197796" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-197796" style="width: 1006px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-197796" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12141204/1712931124-taousdt_2024-04-12_15-11-37.png" alt="" width="1006" height="640" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12141204/1712931124-taousdt_2024-04-12_15-11-37.png 1006w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12141204/1712931124-taousdt_2024-04-12_15-11-37-300x191.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12141204/1712931124-taousdt_2024-04-12_15-11-37-768x489.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12141204/1712931124-taousdt_2024-04-12_15-11-37-150x95.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-197796" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, TAO&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44 and falling, which indicates there could be further losses over the next 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Beyond AI Tokens Like TAO: Solana Meme Coins are Worth Watching</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If AI related tokens and protocols are undoubtedly the blockchain&#8217;s next technological leap, then Solana meme coins are its next cultural one.</p>
<p>Bittensor is a good, solid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-april-11-bittensor-helium-neo.htm">cryptocurrency to invest in</a>. Sure, it has its risks. As with all cryptocurrency investments, people should only invest what they&#8217;re prepared to lose, but Bittensor&#8217;s Proof-of-Intelligence concept and decentralized AI-training model are revolutionary USPs for any token.</p>
<p>Meme coins are another promising sector and Solana meme coins are some of the buzziest right now.</p>
<p>The network‚Äôs latest star is a 420-friendly sloth with big dreams.</p>
<p>In just three weeks, traders have poured well <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-whales-are-accumulating-this-new-solana-meme-coin-before-it-lists-on-exchanges-what-do-they-know.htm">over $10 million</a> into an ICO for new Solana meme coin Slothana ($SLOTH) to try and recapture some of the early upside potential of recently profitable Solana funny tokens like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SLOTHANA IS A PRE-SALE GEM!! COULD BE THE NEXT 100X PRESALE!! SLOTHANA UPDATE!!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kZiAhBNajc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span>Slothana isn‚Äôt lazy, although he certainly appears that way. High on ambition (and surreptitious toking), he‚Äôs¬†</span><span>eyeing the clock hands, waiting for 4:20 because from there, he hopes to get to $420 million.¬†</span></p>
<p>Word on the grapevine says Slothana is by the same team that launched Smog (SMOG), which<span>¬†</span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-airdrop-meme-coin-smog-goes-parabolic-as-new-all-time-highs-defy-bitcoin-price-correction.htm">rallied strongly after ending its presale and listing</a>. Early investors hope to capture that explosive upside potential ahead of a Slothana listing.</p>
<p><span>The clock is ticking and the $SLOTH team has not confirmed launch dates, so the presale window duration is an enigma.¬†</span></p>

<h2><strong>SHORK Price Analysis: Is Shork Coin On The Verge of a Second Rally Leg?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action pushes to the upside once more, SHORK is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/GecXsoJoRkJbShBjAeMVbZtPpEHWCJ2eJoyD67GaAdUV?t=1712931996515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.035</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +15,030%).</p>
<p>This comes after the token launched at just Midnight UTC in a DEX listing on Raydium. It gained almost instant traction, and its price surged +10,000% in the first three hours.</p>
<p>Resistance at $0.062 sent the price tumbling into a strong consolidation pattern above lower support at $0.0225, setting the stage for a further push to SHORK&#8217;s current all-time high at $0.067.</p>

<p>Yet, with the all-time high delivering +50,000% returns to SHORK holders, early-backed moved for a quickfire sell-off around 6 AM UTC &#8211; sending the price tumbling back to support.</p>
<p>However, defying expectations, the support level has once again been successfully defended by holders &#8211; and SHORK price is once again on the climb &#8211; teasing the potential of a second rally leg.</p>
<p>The volatile price action has been fuelled by significant interest from retail investors, represented by an impressive $58m in 24-hour trading volume.</p>
<p>Now standing at a $41m market cap, interest threatens to wane, with the prospect of a major return for late-stage investors diminished to a generous 5x expectation at these levels.</p>
<p>Remarkably, despite more than 8,000 holders, bulls remain in control &#8211; with buy pressure representing 51% of transactions over the past hour.</p>
<p>In other news, a multi-chain dog-themed cryptocurrency is also doing rounds after unlocking viral success at presale with its promise to unify DOGE cross-chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nikolaj Rosenthal, former ice hockey star and CEO of non-custodial staking provider <strong>Myrmidon</strong>, sat down for another exclusive interview with <strong>Cryptonews Podcast</strong> host Matt Zahab.</p>
<p>He talked about his gradual and intentional switch from a professional sports player to a crypto entrepreneur, accepting <strong>Bitcoin</strong> as salary seven years ago, establishing a staking-as-a-service, and chains coming to Myrmidon soon.</p>
<p>Rosenthal told us why ETFs are useful but go against the basic crypto ethos, and how Myrmidon ensures true coin ownership.</p>
<p>Lastly, he discussed the pros and cons of the four staking types: which one is the most difficult but most beneficial earning-wise and which one is the least.</p>
<p>In this interview, Rosenthal discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>being the first athlete to accept BTC as salary in 2017;</li>
<li>Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider;</li>
<li>what‚Äôs going on with Ethereum;</li>
<li>the implications of Ethereum ETF;</li>
<li>solo-home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can watch what Rosenthal told Matt in the video above or read it below.</p>
<h2>From Hokey Player to Crypto Player</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There‚Äôs a pattern in the world of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uefa-searches-for-crypto-exchange-sponsors-for-champions-league.htm">sports</a>, Rosenthal said. Players retire and then feel like they‚Äôve lost their identity. They struggle to live outside the sports world.</p>
<p>Rosenthal didn‚Äôt want this happening to him, so he started spreading out career-wise early on.</p>
<p>Being a pro hockey player in the US or Canada pays very well. In Europe, too, a player can ‚Äúmake a pretty good living.‚Äù But making money article-retirement is difficult.</p>
<p>Rosenthal returned from the US to Europe, well aware that his career would come to its inevitable end.</p>
<p>Therefore, he went to study and earn his degrees from the <strong>Copenhagen Business School</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, in 2016, he fell ‚Äúdeep down the rabbit hole‚Äù of crypto through Danish Bitcoin entrepreneur Niklas Nikolajsen, who founded <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unfortunate-bitcoin-suisse-fed-rates-delayed-tax-season-more-9579.htm">Bitcoin Suisse AG</a></strong> in 2013.</p>
<blockquote><p>This path ultimately led to Rosenthal becoming the first athlete to accept Bitcoin as a salary in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many would certainly think this a very strange and/or bad financial decision at the time. Bitcoin and the world of crypto were very different seven years ago, and they were perceived differently in the mainstream.</p>
<p>But it turned out to be an excellent decision, and there are multiple athletes today accepting their salary in crypto.</p>
<p>And ‚ÄúI definitely orange-pilled a couple of boys, that&#8217;s for sure,‚Äù Rosenthal said.</p>
<p>He noted how relative the term ‚Äòearly‚Äô is. In 2016 he used to think of those who had gotten into the space in 2015 or 2013 as being early.</p>
<p>But now that he looks back, he was early too.</p>
<p>Anybody who gets in today will likely be ‚Äòearly‚Äô for somebody entering the space in 2030, let‚Äôs say.</p>
<h2>No Competitor for Ethereum Yet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rosenthal eventually went on to co-found <strong><a href="https://myrmidonstaking.com/">Myrmidon</a></strong> in 2022. It‚Äôs a non-custodial staking provider primarily focused on <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-sees-18-billion-daily-trading-volume-can-eth-overtake-btc.htm">Ethereum</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The CEO commented that ‚Äútoday, Ethereum is still the biggest L1 chain out there.‚Äù</p>
<p>There are some layer-1 blockchains competing with it, including <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-drops-10-in-a-week-whats-going-on.htm">Solana</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/which-new-meme-coin-will-avalanche-foundation-invest-in-next.htm">Avalanche</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-as-ada-drops-out-of-top-10-crypto-rankings-whats-going-on.htm">Cardano</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But ‚Äúthe bottom line is that Ethereum is still the one to beat, in my view,‚Äù Rosenthal remarked.</p>
<p>Since the last time Rosenthal was a guest at Cryptonews Podcast back in 2021, Ethereum has undergone a number of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-everything-you-need-to-know-before-the-dencun-launch-today.htm">major upgrades</a>. And ‚Äúeverything went smoothly,‚Äù he said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to the entire <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> community on a succesful Dencun upgrade on epoch 269,568. <br />Here are some of the most important things you need to know about the upgrade <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="üßµ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />: <a href="https://t.co/zQbYLS0ELg">pic.twitter.com/zQbYLS0ELg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Myrmidon Staking<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f987.png" alt="ü¶á" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f50a.png" alt="üîä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@Myrmidonstaking) <a href="https://twitter.com/Myrmidonstaking/status/1768280670160253358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>An issue, Rosenthal argued, is that some people may not understand what an update is supposed to do, expecting it to do something else ‚Äì for example, lower the fees, which are a major pain point for Ethereum.</p>
<p>A negative narrative is then created around the chain when an upgrade doesn‚Äôt do what it wasn‚Äôt supposed to do in the first place.</p>
<p>Though he doesn‚Äôt fully understand why there has been so much negativity recently directed at Ethereum, Rosenthal remarked that it does follow historical patterns of ‚ÄúETH getting hammered, Bitcoin taking off.‚Äù</p>
<p>The latter is up primarily because of the exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-etfs/">ETF</a>) approval is the US. And <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vaneck-ceo-says-sec-unlikely-to-approve-spot-ether-etfs-in-may.htm">Ethereum ETFs</a> are expected to follow.</p>
<p>And while personally he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúreally care about the ETF,‚Äù the entrepreneur finds it beneficial for adoption.</p>
<p>That said, ‚Äúlong-term, ETH ETF or not, it doesn&#8217;t really matter for the adoption of ETH because I can&#8217;t really see a competitor to ETH as it is right now,‚Äù Rosenthal opined.</p>
<h2>Case Against ETF and For True Ownership</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Going deeper into the ETF argument, Rosenthal argued that ‚Äúit&#8217;s a great product for the average person out there.‚Äù</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy way to enter the space and get exposure to the asset class.</p>
<p>But there is a big ‚Äòbut‚Äô. It‚Äôs counter-crypto.</p>
<p>Crypto, Rosenthal says, was invented for people to custody their own assets and always maintain full control.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF is, by default, not a product that allows this.</p>
<p>People make different choices when managing their assets. And it likely can‚Äôt be expected that everybody will self-custody.</p>
<p>However, ‚Äúfor me, the underlying asset and owning the underlying asset is really what matters,‚Äù Rosenthal said.</p>
<p>This is why the Myrmidon team made the non-custodial solution, <a href="https://myrmidonstaking.com/dashboard">Ethereum Staking Dashboard</a>, enabling people to easily stake their ETH without losing control over it.</p>
<p>The stakers don‚Äôt give up their keys, and they also earn yield.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a saying in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> &#8211;<br />&quot;Not your keys, not your coins&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s why we&#39;re all about native non-custodial <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> staking <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1fae1.png" alt="ü´°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So why pick us?<br />1&#x20e3; You have 100% validator control<br />2&#x20e3; 0% protocol rewards fee<br />3&#x20e3; 100% native staking</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notably, Rosenthal explained, Ethereum staking is a bit different. Most <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/proof-of-stake/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchains use delegation: for example, you delegate <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">ADA</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">SOL</a> to the stake provider.</p>
<p>However, if you want to stake your ETH, you have to make a transaction to the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/">Beacon chain</a>, and if you want to get the ETH back, you have to send the correct data to unlock it, the entrepreneur said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s a very complicated process,‚Äù Rosenthal opined.</p>
<p>And because it‚Äôs difficult for many to understand, they turn to centralized exchanges. This choice comes with its own set of security risks.</p>
<p>Therefore, Myrmidon enabled people to stake their ETH, maintain ownership over it, and exit the staking position easily.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe&#8217;re trying to make a friendly UI for ETH staking, which is not very UI-friendly,‚Äù Rosenthal said.</p>
<p>The downside of Myrmidon‚Äôs service is that it must support native ETH staking, which means that users must stake 32 ETH per validator.</p>
<p>That said, ‚Äúas of yet, we haven&#8217;t found one single provider [besides Myrmidon] who can safely say that they are truly non-custodial staking providers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hence, unlike Myrmidon, should something happen with the provider, the users‚Äô ETH is gone forever.</p>
<h2>The Four Staking Categories: Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Rosenthal went on to discuss the four categories of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dydx-community-vote-stake-60-million-security-boost.htm">staking</a>.</p>
<p>These are solo home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking.</p>
<p>He explained that we can observe <a href="https://myrmidonstaking.medium.com/ethereum-eth-staking-guide-b4ce2cbce62f">these categories</a> as listed from the most to the least decentralized, from the most difficult to the easiest, and from the most secure to the least secure.</p>
<p>Solo home staking is the hardest and requires the most knowledge and work, given the constant updates. But it‚Äôs also the most decentralized, the most secure, and the most rewarding.</p>
<p>Staking-as-a-service is what Myrmidon does. It‚Äôs a very decentralized way to stake ETH, and it‚Äôs also not easy. However, if you know how to operate a wallet, you can choose this option.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyrmidonStaking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MyrmidonStaking</a> offers a user-friendly platform for staking <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> kinda like the launchpad? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9d0.png" alt="üßê" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s actually more like a dashboard and launchpad in one built right into our staking solution, which is 100% non-custodial <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="üòé" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>&mdash; Myrmidon Staking<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f987.png" alt="ü¶á" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f50a.png" alt="üîä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@Myrmidonstaking) <a href="https://twitter.com/Myrmidonstaking/status/1777645033207816697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Pool staking is a very popular solution. For one, it doesn‚Äôt require 32 ETH, but only 0.1 ETH. It‚Äôs easy and convenient. But the big issues are smart contract risk and centralization.</p>
<p>The final option is the easiest and the riskiest one: centralized staking. Here, the centralized exchanges do the work for you. They don‚Äôt require 32 ETH either. At the same time, stakers give up control over their assets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the yield gets significantly lower as you go further down the list.</p>
<p>For example, those who use staking-as-a-service, get all base rewards, hence they earn more.</p>
<h2>More Chains Incoming</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Myrmidon team has so far primarily been focused on Ethereum.</p>
<p>However, that‚Äôs not to say they haven‚Äôt worked with other chains or started planning support for additional chains.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou should definitely check our website because we&#8217;re going to pop up new networks over course of 2024,‚Äù Rosenthal said.</p>
<p>Just recently, the team launched Cardano, which is ‚Äúoff to a great start.‚Äù</p>
<p>Users can now delegate their ADA coins via Myrmidon.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe run the largest pool as a third-party provider for that ecosystem,‚Äù said Rosenthal.</p>
<p>Therefore, the company supports three networks currently, while the fourth ‚Äì <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/internet-computer-enters-top-10-as-dfinity-offers-usd-223m-i-10465.htm">Fleek</a></strong> ‚Äì is expected to go live this summer, in Q3.</p>
<p>Myrmidon will not launch any chains before it has customers on them, Rosenthal stressed.</p>
<p>Running various networks without customers is wasting time and effort that can be put elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is especially true for Myrmidon, which hosts everything in-house and does not rely on third parties like <strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>Google Cloud</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, they focused on setting up a second server on a different energy grid as another security layer, which can take over should anything happen to the first one.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is plenty to do at all times.</p>
<p>And with their dashboard launched and doing well, these are ‚Äúgreat times, exciting times, exciting markets,‚Äù Rosenthal concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>The victims of an investment fraud scheme have called on China to negotiate with the UK government to recover 61,000 Bitcoin seized in a money laundering investigation, valued at $4.3 billion at the time of publication.</span></p>
<p><span>This Bitcoin is the result of a $6.2 Billion wealth management fraud conducted between 2014 and 2017, fronted by Chinese company Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology. </span></p>
<p><span>In which, more than 128,000 people were defrauded.</span></p>
<p><span>The UK government became aware of the situation after ex-restaurant worker Jian Wen attempted to launder funds by purchasing a $30 million property with Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span>However, the transaction could not be completed since Wen was unable to explain the source of the funds.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-197722 size-large" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12111209/1712920328-siezed-house-1024x576.jpg" alt="Image of the property that Wen attempted to purchase with Bitcoin.

<p><span>This prompted an investigation, which culminated in a raid on a property rented by &#8220;front person&#8221; Wen and her boss Zhimin Qian, the suspected mastermind of the operation. During the raid, investigators </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-worth-1-7b-seized-as-ex-restaurant-worker-tries-to-buy-30m-london-mansion-with-fraud-money.htm"><span>seized</span></a><span> 61,000 Bitcoins, worth $1.7 billion at the time.</span></p>
<p><span>Under pressure to explain the damning situation, Wen initially claimed that Bitcoin was mined. </span></p>
<p><span>She eventually changed her story, stating it was a &#8220;love present&#8221; from Qian, who fled the country after the raid.</span></p>
<p><span>Jian Wen was ultimately put on trial for assisting Qian in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewellery, and property. </span></p>
<p><span>While Wen denied all charges, Southwark Crown Court convicted her </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-woman-found-guilty-of-laundering-2-5b-in-bitcoin.htm"><span>guilty</span></a><span> of three counts of money laundering on March 20th.</span></p>
<h2><span>Bitcoin Seized: The Victims Want What is Rightfully Theirs</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Following the conviction, a group representing the scam victims set out to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money, now worth $4.3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span>The group reportedly </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/605a7ca9-3f5f-47e6-ab5c-818b9a1bf0d5"><span>submitted</span></a><span> a letter to China&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to negotiate with the UK government for the return of the &#8220;huge amount&#8221; of seized Bitcoin.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>They also contacted China&#8217;s Ministry of Public Security, claiming to have the backing of almost 2,500 signatures from the victims, and want to submit them to both ministries.</span></p>
<p><span>The letter requests that the Chinese government and the UK judicial departments work together to submit evidence proving their status as &#8220;legitimate owners.&#8221; The group said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>‚ÄúWe do not want, and will never accept, a situation where Bitcoins are confiscated by the UK and not returned to us.‚Äù</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>At the time of writing, the UK government had not issued a statement on how it intends to deal with the Bitcoin it holds, and Qian is still at large.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the UK government evaluates that no one else was entitled to the asset, it would typically be divided and distributed to the police and Home Office.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the victims who &#8220;suffered extremely serious economic losses, resulting in family breakdown, separation from their children, indebtedness, and no money for medical treatment,&#8221; have not gone without aid.</span></p>
<p><span>Four victims who lost money in the scam claim that, since last May, victims who enrolled with Chinese police have received two pay-outs from a task group on the fraud, headed by Tianjin authorities.</span></p>
<p><span>They stated that 8% and 5% of their investment capital had been returned with assets recovered from Lantian Gerui and its former employees.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, a local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country&#8217;s largest lender, has committed to assisting with the return process and has estimated that 207,000 people invested in the fraudulent scheme.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This figure is an improvement compared to the net loss of 90.6 billion won in 2022. Gopax&#8217;s revenue grew 97% year over year amid recovering market sentiment.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GOPAX reported a net loss of 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) for the fiscal year 2023. As of the end of the reporting period, the company&#8217;s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by KRW 66 billion, and total liabilities exceeded total assets by KRW 101 billion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most of Gopax&#8217;s net losses stemmed from GoFi-linked debt, from deposits stuck in Genesis Global Capital. Genesis, which operated Gopax&#8217;s crypto custody service GoFi, suspended withdrawals in November 2022 due to a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement with FTX. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the financial report, GoFi still owes users 63.7 billion won.</span></p>

Furthermore, the net operating loss decreased substantially, contracting 78% to approximately 17 billion won.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean cryptocurrency market propelled Gopax&#8217;s enhanced financial results in 2023.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance became the majority shareholder and took on the responsibility for GoFi&#8217;s debt, appointing Leon Singh Pung, the former head of Binance Asia Pacific, as CEO of Gopax.¬†</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite submitting a report on the change in virtual asset business to the FIU, the decision regarding its acceptance has been consistently postponed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gopax later replaced its CEO with former CEO Lee Jung-hoon and submitted another change report, but the FIU continued to delay its decision.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to these challenges, Binance has initiated discussions to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-reduce-stake-in-south-korean-digital-asset-exchange-gopax.htm">reduce its shares in Gopax to become the second-largest shareholder.</a> This strategic move will alleviate Gopax&#8217;s financial burdens and regulatory compliance pressures. Binance CEO Richard Teng even traveled to Seoul in March to engage with local financial regulators to address these concerns.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As of the latest financial report, Binance remains the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake. However, a Binance spokesperson has stated that there are no updates regarding any changes to Binance&#8217;s ownership stake in Gopax.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floki Inu has fallen by 4% in the past 24 hours, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/floki-inu/">the FLOKI price</a> sinking to $0.0001929 as the wider crypto market sees a very slight 0.5% dip today.</p>
<p>While FLOKI is up by 2.5% in a week, it has now declined by 30% in a week, although the popular meme coin has posted a 460% increase in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>This is very impressive performance, and with FLOKI remaining popular among retail investors and whales, it could easily see a recovery in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case when the market is waiting on a possible surge, which could coincide with the next Bitcoin halving on April 20.</p>
<h2>Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 4% Overnight ‚Äì What&#8217;s Going On?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One encouraging feature of FLOKI&#8217;s chart is that it has bounced a little in the past hour, after dropping earlier this morning.</p>
<p>This could mean that it has bottomed out as far as its recent decline is concerned, a claim which receives some tentative reinforcement from its support line (green).</p>
<figure id="attachment_197701" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-197701" style="width: 4310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-197701" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart.png" alt="Floki price chart." width="4310" height="2396" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart.png 4310w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart-300x167.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart-1024x569.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart-768x427.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart-1536x854.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart-2048x1139.png 2048w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12104159/1712918514-floki-price-chart-150x83.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4310px) 100vw, 4310px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-197701" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s also notable that FLOKI&#8217;s 30-day average (orange) has reached what looks like a bottom in relation to the 200-day (blue), implying that the coin has entered an oversold position and is ready to rebound.</p>
<p>Having said that, FLOKI&#8217;s trading volume remains largely lowkey at $150 million, whereas it rose as high as $2 billion in early March.</p>
<p>What we can take from this is that whales have yet to return to the meme token, despite <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1766161879905534311">having pumped it vigorously in the weeks preceding its last big surge</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a>: It seems that price is still in a wave-iv correction. Ideal target for wave-C is the 100% Fib extension level at $0.000137.</p>
<p>A break above $0.000266 would be the first sign that wave-iv already has bottomed. <a href="https://t.co/RSt5KjF9bi">pic.twitter.com/RSt5KjF9bi</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Yet given that the coin has been down for several weeks now, it may be a good time to buy it, given that it&#8217;s selling at a relative discount.</p>
<p>Indeed, the next week or so may see the crypto market rally as a whole, helped by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-less-than-two-weeks-remain-until-bitcoin-halving-event-100000-incoming.htm">the incoming Bitcon halving</a>, which is due in eight days.</p>
<p>And the Floki price could ride any resulting bull market, with <a href="https://content.bitazza.com/freedom-dao-listing-11-apr-2024/">the token continuing to attract new exchange listings</a> that could support it in the long run.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also has a detailed and ambitious roadmap that should help improve its utility and fundamentals.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">FLOKI ROADMAP: WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT ON OUR¬†AGENDA‚Ä¶</p>
<p>From the get-go, we‚Äôve been VERY clear about our goal for Floki:</p>
<p>To be the most known and most used cryptocurrency in the world.</p>
<p>Our new roadmap outlines how we intend to achieve this:<a href="https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH">https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH</a> <a href="https://t.co/hBydq4D4lX">pic.twitter.com/hBydq4D4lX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1771166636420034588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For this reason, the Floki price should reach $0.00025 in the next couple of months, before reaching $0.00035 in the latter half of the year.</p>
<h2>Newer Meme Tokens May Bring Bigger Returns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While FLOKI remains one of the most popular meme coins in the market, it isn&#8217;t the only promising token available right now.</p>
<p>Numerous newer meme coins have emerged in the past few weeks, with several holding presales that not only help support their development, but also help them attract supporters prior to listing.</p>
<p>One coin doing this is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/">Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE)</a>, a multi-chain meme token that has raised more than $2.8 million in its increasingly popular sale.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>$DOGEVERSE opens its doors to a wide audience, from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> aficionados to those preferring the rapid, cost-effective benefits of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Solana</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Polygon</a>, fostering a diverse and inclusive community. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f415.png" alt="üêï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f31f.png" alt="üåü" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/sXPOvaoz67">pic.twitter.com/sXPOvaoz67</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>What&#8217;s so exciting about Dogeverse is that it&#8217;s one of the only meme tokens in the market to make itself multi-chain.</span></p>
<p><span>It will </span>launch on <span>Ethereum, before bridging to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.</span></p>
<p>What this means is that it will find applications and uses in multiple ecosystems and platforms, something which could raise its demand in relation to other similar tokens.</p>
<p>It also comes with bullish tokenomics, with its capped supply of 200 million tokens ultimately making it a deflationary token.</p>
<p>And unlike the original Dogecoin, holders will be able to stake DOGEVERSE, earning themselves a passive income in addition to any price gains.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOGEVERSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DOGEVERSE</a> bringing in optimized costs and speed! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="‚ö°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Users enjoy the ability to choose chains with lower transaction fees and faster processing times, significantly enhancing the trading and transaction experience. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f310.png" alt="üåê" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/phcMnBhwLT">pic.twitter.com/phcMnBhwLT</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>All in all, the use of multiple chains will make DOGEVERSE one of the fastest and most useful tokens in the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p><span>Investors can join its presale by heading over to </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/">the official Dogeverse website</a>, where ¬†<span>1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000293.</span></p>
<p>The presale has an allocation of 15% of the coin&#8217;s overall supply, with 10% going to staking and 50% going to marketing and project funds (a further 15% goes to liquidity and another 10% to its ecosystem).</p>
<p>Given how quickly the sale is raising money, it may sell out fairly soon, so interested parties are advised to act quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of DeFi exchange Uniswap&#8217;s native token UNI is 15% lower than it was this time last week following yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sec-warns-uniswap-labs-potential-enforcement-action-2024-04-10/">news</a> that the US SEC may launch a potential enforcement action against it for alleged securities law violations.</p>
<p>UNI currently trades at $9.08, which makes for a 24-hour loss of about 2.1%. While these losses suggest more of a dip than a crash, it&#8217;s still the heaviest overnight depreciation by any of the 20 biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap except Toncoin (TON).</p>
<p>Telegram&#8217;s cryptocurrency spin-off TON shed 3.6% overnight and currently trades for $7.13. That&#8217;s heavy when juxtaposed with the rest of the leaders&#8217; performances today, but TON is still some 37.5% higher than it was this time last week, thanks to some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-neo-price-climbs-40-as-attention-shifts-to-new-blockchain-project.htm">singular rallies</a> recently.</p>

<p>According to UNI&#8217;s chart, token holders enjoyed remarkably steep and intense growth spurts on Friday, 23 February and Wednesday, 06 March, amidst a sustained turn-of-the-month fortnight-long rally across the market.</p>
<p>For UNI holders, this peaked when their token hit $16 and it has been in steady decline since, with the steepest losses posted in the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, a sell-off, which gained momentum on the eighth peaked yesterday when the RSI bottomed down to about 20.</p>
<p>Since a reading of 30 is considered &#8220;oversold&#8221;, this dump appears to have been heavy, however, in the last 24 hours, the reading has risen back up to about 41, indicating buying momentum is picking up.</p>
<h2>Uniswap? DEXs? DeFi? Learn and earn with 99Bitcoins!</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Uniswap is DeFi&#8217;s largest decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>
<p>This means users can buy and sell a large inventory of cryptocurrencies as with centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but they have to self-custody their crypto.</p>
<p>Some see this as a barrier to entry. While it&#8217;s not difficult to select a wallet and begin trading crypto on DEXs, it&#8217;s not as streamlined as whipping out a MasterCard, paying for it, and letting the exchange do the custodial work.</p>
<p>Many lost faith in letting exchanges custody their crypto after the recession in 2021/2022, when crypto companies with liquidity troubles routinely paused withdrawals to head off bank runs.</p>
<p>It culminated with the collapse of FTX, an exchange that had been sending billions of customer funds to its sister company, Alameda Research.</p>
<p>Since these revelations, there has been growing attraction around DeFi and self-custodying crypto through decentralized wallets that give them control over their own private keys, like Uniswap&#8217;s.</p>
<p>If anything, the events of 2021 were a reminder to the industry on the importance of educating the public.</p>
<p>The most important lesson people learned after FTX was the importance decentralization: the founding ethos of crypto.</p>
<p>However, it can be overwhelming to crypto novices to know where to educate themselves. Luckily, there is a new crypto presale for an established crypto education project that hopes to revolutionize learning with its learn-to-earn model.</p>
