<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The executive, Tigran Gambaryan, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">along with</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> another Binance official</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, is</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> facing accusations of laundering over $35 million.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The case, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which has </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">been</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> adjourned</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> until May 2, is being handled by Nigeria&#8217;s anti-corruption body.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance CEO Says They Are Working to Resolve Matter</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai, Binance CEO Richard Teng </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/binance-working-closely-with-nigeria-authorities-resolve-execs-detention-ceo-2024-04-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">addressed Gambaryan&#8217;s situation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, claiming </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that they</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are working to deal with the issue. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;What I can say is we are working very closely with the Nigerian authorities </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to try</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to resolve the matter.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Meanwhile, the other executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, a </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">British-Kenyan</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> serving as a regional manager for Africa, fled Nigeria last month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anjarwalla and Gambaryan had traveled to Nigeria after the country implemented a ban on several cryptocurrency trading websites. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, upon their arrival on February 26, they were detained by Nigeria&#8217;s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the EFCC case, Nigeria&#8217;s tax agency, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), has charged Binance and the executives with tax evasion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tax evasion case </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is set</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to appear before a court on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance&#8217;s head of regional markets, Vishal Sacheendran, emphasized that the detentions were an isolated incident and unprecedented for the company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, he declined to comment on the charges against Binance itself.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The charges against Binance Holdings Limited and its chief executives include tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering amounting to $35.4 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Court documents reveal that charges were filed against Binance Holdings Limited, Tigran Gambaryan, and Nadeem Anjarwalla (now at large) on March 28, 2024, before the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The charges include engaging in specialized financial business without a valid license, conducting business as a financial institution without authorization, unlawful negotiation of foreign exchange rates, conspiracy to conceal the origin of illicit funds, and money laundering.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, on March 22, the Nigerian government filed another four-count charge against Binance Holdings Limited, Anjarwalla, and Gambaryan, accusing them of offering services to subscribers on their platform without registering with the Federal Inland Revenue Service and failing to pay relevant taxes.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance Receives Dubai License</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance recently announced that it has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-dubai-crypto-licence-following-cz-resignation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">obtained a license from Dubai&#8217;s regulator</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, VARA, enabling the platform to cater to retail clients along with qualified and institutional ones. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Bloomberg, the licensing process involved Binance&#8217;s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, relinquishing voting control of the Dubai unit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, Teng dismissed the report as speculation, emphasizing that the company does not comment on media speculation and maintains confidential relationships with regulators.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The European Union&#8217;s securities watchdog recently highlighted that &#8220;crypto exchanges largely operate outside of national legal frameworks&#8221; and mentioned that Binance claims not to have a headquarters. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked about Binance&#8217;s choice of global headquarters, Teng revealed that the company has shortlisted potential locations but refrained from commenting on specific places or providing a timeline for a definitive decision.</span></p>

<p><span>Running from April 19th until April 28th, </span><a href="https://coinpoker.com/tournament/csop/"><span>CSOP Spring</span></a><span> will feature 41 high-octane events played out over 10 days, with freeroll beginning today.</span></p>
<h2><b>What to Expect at CoinPoker’s CSOP Spring?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Don’t miss out on the opportunity to participate in the CSOP Spring event, which will see up to $1,000,000 in total prizes and an additional $10,000 added value benefit.</span></p>
<p><span>With hundreds of participants fighting it out over 2 weeks, the event starts with the launch of freerolls on April 18th, alongside exciting $20 CSOP Opener and $50 MonsterStack events.</span></p>
<p><span>If that’s not enough, then don’t skip a beat in joining PKO action via PKO days with significant GTD events.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-200740 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064258/1713508978-csop-coinpoker-tournament-series-crypto-poker.jpg" alt="CoinPoker CSOP tournaments" width="966" height="283" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064258/1713508978-csop-coinpoker-tournament-series-crypto-poker.jpg 966w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064258/1713508978-csop-coinpoker-tournament-series-crypto-poker-300x88.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064258/1713508978-csop-coinpoker-tournament-series-crypto-poker-768x225.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064258/1713508978-csop-coinpoker-tournament-series-crypto-poker-150x44.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></p>
<p><span>Throughout the mid-series days of the tournament, there will even be special PLO events in a dramatic build-up to the highly anticipated CSOP signature high-stakes tournaments.</span></p>
<p><span>This culminates in a seismic showdown at the Grand Finale event where the high roller action will become a reality.</span></p>
<h2><b>New CSOP Leaderboard Could Generate Up To $10,000 In Extra Prizes</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Participants who commit to a $500 buy-in have the chance to climb the public CSOP leaderboard, which ranks players based on points earned through participation, in-the-money finishes and top-round placements.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal here is to create the ultimate competitive environment for players to thrive &#8211; and participation in any CSOP event will enroll you on the board.</span></p>
<p><span>And this isn’t just for bragging rights &#8211; the top 20 players on the board will receive a supercharged split of a $10,000 prize pot &#8211; including the possibility of unlocking a passport to attend the Summer Showdown series in July.</span></p>
<h2><b>CHP Price Analysis: Will Spring CSOP Supercharge CHP Token Price?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>At the time of writing CHP token was currently trading at a </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/polygon/0x69437901da6952da49bca49ffc923dfb82abfb16/"><span>market price of $0.059</span></a><span> (representing a 24 hour change of +0.10%).</span></p>
<p><span>A glance at the CHP price chart reveals the seismic impact of the upcoming CSOP Spring &#8211; which has breathed life into struggling price action &#8211; triggering an upside move.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-200741" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064404/1713509044-coinpoker-chp-price-chart.jpg" alt="CoinPoker CHP" width="1358" height="538" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064404/1713509044-coinpoker-chp-price-chart.jpg 1358w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064404/1713509044-coinpoker-chp-price-chart-300x119.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064404/1713509044-coinpoker-chp-price-chart-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064404/1713509044-coinpoker-chp-price-chart-768x304.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/19064404/1713509044-coinpoker-chp-price-chart-150x59.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1358px) 100vw, 1358px" /></p>
<p><span>This shifts CHP sentiment bullish, with price action now consolidating recent gains atop a higher support level above $0.0575.</span></p>
<p><span>Increased buy pressure (91% of transactions in the past 24 hours) due to the event announcement could fuel further upside moves &#8211; especially amid a reflected growth in volume.</span></p>
<p><span>And indeed, with a market cap standing at $16.24m &#8211; it doesn’t seem unlikely that CHP could unlock as much as 5x gains over the coming months ahead.</span></p>
<h2><b>How CSOP Could Make You Part of a Poker Legacy</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Participating in CoinPoker’s Spring CSOP could make you part of a major poker legacy in the GambleFi space, positioning you as a cutting-edge player at the beating heart of innovation in the space.</span></p>
<p><span>Past CSOP events have seen big names break out &#8211; and it’s clear that CSOP 2024 is where legends are made.</span></p>
<p><span>Look no further than </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TonyGuoga?"><span>Tony Guoga</span></a><span>, the founder of CoinPoker (often called ‘the Home of Poker on Web3’), a World Series of Poker veteran and Lithuanian Politician.</span></p>
<p><span>Affectionately known as Tony G, Guoga has had 15 money finishes in the World Series, and has appeared on the final table at the World Poker Tour twice &#8211; and took part in the biggest online poker pot in history ($7,750,000 played at CoinPoker) &#8211; so needless to say, this man knows his way around a pack of cards.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="BIGGEST POT in ONLINE POKER HISTORY! 7,750,000.62$ Pot! Pot Limit Omaha $5000/$10000 feat.

<p><span>CoinPoker is recommended by top review sites in the poker space </span><a href="https://www.rakeback.com/"><span>such as Rakeback</span></a><span>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said that war or terrorist attacks could potentially lead to a 10% to 15% decline in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/"><span>Bitcoin’s</span></a> value over the next year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/04/18/bitcoin-is-still-very-young-in-terms-of-adoption-says-skybridge-capitals-anthony-scaramucci.html"><span>CNBC interview</span></a> published Thursday, Scaramucci discussed Bitcoin’s nascent stage of adoption. He said the asset will not achieve its marketed role as an inflation hedge or a store of value until its user base surpasses 1 billion.</p>
<p>“Right now, it&#8217;s going to be way more volatile than people like,” he said. “And people look at it as a risk-on or risk-off trade until we get to that adoption.”</p>
<p>His comments came before Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Friday amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. The drop followed reports of an Israeli missile strike on Iran.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Falls in Wake of Reported Missile Strike</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to ABC News, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-gaza-hamas-war/?id=108860743"><span>Israel launched missiles in a retaliatory strike</span></a> against Iran early Friday. Iran&#8217;s Fars news agency reported hearing three explosions near a military base in Isfahan, a central city. An Iranian official reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-missiles-hit-site-iran-abc-news-reports-2024-04-19/"><span>refuted claims of a missile attack</span></a>, attributing the explosions to the activation of Iran&#8217;s air defense systems.</p>
<p>During geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, investors tend to become more cautious and seek safer assets to protect their investments. Traditionally, they turn to assets like gold and government bonds for safety.</p>
<p>Scaramucci went on to express optimism regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. He anticipates factors like the recent Spot ETF launch, the entry of major financial institutions, and the upcoming halving event to potentially propel Bitcoin&#8217;s value toward $200,000.</p>
<p>Additionally, he dismissed concerns about excessive centralization due to ETFs. Scaramucci argues that current institutional ownership, including BlackRock, represents a relatively small portion of the overall Bitcoin market, less than 10%.</p>
<h2>Scaramucci Ups Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Scaramucci&#8217;s most recent price prediction for Bitcoin exceeds his prior forecast. Earlier this year, he projected that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/skybridges-anthony-scaramucci-says-bitcoin-still-has-room-to-run.htm"><span>Bitcoin could surge to $170,000</span></a> by mid-to-late 2025, assuming it maintained a price of above $45,000 at the time of the halving.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin network undergoes a technical event known as a halving, which serves to decrease the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The e-CNY Research Institute has been inaugurated to support advancements of China’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-central-bank-to-speed-up-cbdc-project.htm">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Ethereum network reported a robust income of $365 million in the first quarter of 2024, an impressive year-on-year revenue growth of 155%. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://thedefireport.io/research/ethereum-networks-q1-earnings-results#7-key-insights-from-the-q-124-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report by Michael Nadeau</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an analyst at The DeFi Report, Ethereum&#8217;s Q1 income represents a staggering 200% increase compared to the $123 million profit recorded in Q4 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A major contributing factor to this substantial growth was the surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity during the quarter, driving heightened network participation.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum Fee Revenue Reaches $1.17B in Q1</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum&#8217;s fee revenue, generated through user transactions, reached a notable milestone of $1.17 billion in Q1, marking a remarkable 155% increase from the same period in 2023 and an 80% upswing from the previous quarter. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The amplified network activity, fueled by the surge in DeFi applications, has propelled Ethereum&#8217;s average daily transactions in 2024 to surpass last year&#8217;s figures.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The current average of 1.15 million daily transactions is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in close proximity to</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the peak levels witnessed during Ethereum&#8217;s momentous run in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that Ethereum, which was launched in 2015, achieved its first profitable year in 2023, amassing $623 million in revenue. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the revenues being significantly lower (75%) than the peak of $9.9 billion attained in 2021, this achievement can be attributed to the transition to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022, resulting in a substantial drop in token incentives paid to miners, now known as validators.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrencies to Outperform Other Assets</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nadeau said that &#8220;crypto will outperform everything else&#8221; in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He anticipates favorable liquidity conditions for the next few years, driven by the need for refinancing a substantial amount of debt in the United States and the market&#8217;s expectation of three rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These factors are poised to provide a tailwind for risk assets like tech stocks and quality cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nadeau identified three additional catalysts that indicate a bullish setup for the crypto market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is expected to increase interest and accessibility to cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Secondly, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 20, has historically prompted a bull run in the subsequent year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lastly, Nadeau highlighted the ongoing innovation cycle, which he believes will attract new venture funding and reignite retail interest in crypto as the industry matures.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Bitcoin typically outperforms in the early stages of a bull market due to its widespread recognition, Nadeau noted that Ethereum and altcoins tend to outperform Bitcoin in the later stages of the cycle. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Altcoins, which have a clear product market fit, have demonstrated substantial growth in the previous cycles, surpassing Bitcoin&#8217;s performance across the entire duration.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-network-achieves-one-million-validators.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">surpassed one million validators</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, show that the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span>Amid fluctuating market conditions, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s price has dipped to $60,547, signaling a 1.74% decrease in the last 24 hours. This movement underpins ongoing volatility as traders and analysts closely monitor trends to update their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/#:~:text=As%20more%20and%20more%20people,by%20the%20end%20of%202025.">Bitcoin price prediction</a>.</span></p>
<p><span> Despite this recent downturn, Bitcoin continues to dominate the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">crypto market</a> with a robust trading volume of $40.55 billion and a market capitalization nearing $1.19 trillion.</span></p>

<span>The technical analysis for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC/USD)</a> shows it navigating through a challenging phase.

<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $65,415, further reinforcing the resistance around the $62,200 level. This configuration of the EMA confirms the resistance created by the downward channel, adding a technical obstacle to Bitcoin’s upward mobility.</p>
<p><span>In conclusion, the outlook for Bitcoin is currently bearish below the key pivot of $62,216. Should Bitcoin manage to break above this threshold, it could indicate a shift to a more bullish sentiment. However, as long as the price remains below this level, the path of least resistance appears to be downward, with potential targets located at lower support levels.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs officials took a $53.2 million Bitcoin and ETH bribe from a crypto exchange executive, a major newspaper in the country claimed this week.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6650082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kommersant</a>, the officials were named Georgy Satyukov and Dmitry Sokolov, employees at “one of the ministry’s most secret divisions.”</p>
<p>The media outlet and major Russian Telegram news channels claimed the duo worked at the Bureau of Special Technical Events. The bureau is allegedly codenamed “Department K.”</p>
<p>Reports claim the duo received their bribes in crypto over a period from March 19 to October 2021.</p>
<h2>Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Rocked by Crypto Bribe Allegations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Telegram news channels claimed Department K is a secret cyber crime investigation unit. The unit appears to have been investigating the BTC-e crypto exchange.</p>
<p>A computer expert named Alexander Vinnik founded BTC-e. Vinnik worked at the firm from 2011 to 2017. He was arrested in Greece in 2017 on fraud and money laundering charges.</p>
<p>Media outlets explained that a Singapore-based firm named Wex took over BTC-e business operations. However, questions remained over what should happen regarding BTC-e customer funds.</p>
<p>Law enforcers allegedly believe a Wex executive named Alexey Ivanov offered Satyukov and Sokolov Bitcoin and Ethereum coins to “protect” him from a police probe.</p>
<p>Officers reportedly believe Ivanov sent Satyukov and Sokolov a combined total of BTC 2,200 and “more than ETH 10,000 thousand.”</p>
<p>The media outlets said the money “was transferred through Sokolov to cryptocurrency wallets held by Satyukov.”</p>

<h2>Officials ‘Fled Country Fearing Prosecution’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Kommersant said the duo had been arrested “in absentia” after fleeing the country. An unnamed source said they were residing in Dubai, with one living in an apartment in the Burj Khalifa – the world’s tallest building.</p>
<p>The media outlet said that investigators had “learned about the alleged corruption in the department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” from Ivanov.</p>
<p>The latter was accused of embezzling money from a crypto exchange in 2023. Kommersant said Ivanov had agreed to provide information in a “pre-trial agreement” with the First Deputy Prosecutor-General Anatoly Razinkin.</p>

<p>The newspaper wrote that, if the duo were guilty, this would be a new record for a bribery case in Russia.</p>
<p>The previous “holder” of this “record” was another interior ministry official, Colonel Dmitry Zakharchenko. The latter was jailed for 13 years in 2019 after taking a bribe worth almost $15 million.</p>

<h2>‘People Think Crypto Transactions Aren’t Traceable. They’re Wrong’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Media commentators said there was “a misconception that bribes or any fraudulent actions that make use of cryptocurrency cannot be tracked” in Russia. As such, many corrupt officials “actively use” crypto.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bfm.ru/news/548439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BFM</a> quoted the Co-chairman of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Alexander Treshchev as stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is great uncertainty about the legal status of cryptocurrency in Russia, even though there are at least 1.5 to 2 million crypto traders in this country. Few of them know anything about whether [crypto trading] is legal. They don’t know what can be done, and what cannot be done.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Russian government’s crypto working group chairman believes Bitcoin (BTC) mining regulation is now a priority for Moscow.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/news?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#news</a><a href="https://t.co/Gqdg4vwnZB">https://t.co/Gqdg4vwnZB</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Treshchev added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we can clearly see, law enforcement officers have begun to understand what crypto wallets are and how to transfer [coins]. But they are still just as naive as everyone else in that they do not understand that every single transaction is traceable [on blockchain networks].”</p></blockquote>
<p>Russia’s lack of crypto regulation has become a thorn in Moscow’s side. Earlier this year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russia-fatf-rating-downgraded-due-to-insufficient-crypto-regulation.htm">downgraded Russia’s compliance rating</a> due to its “insufficient regulation of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.”</p>
<p>Politicians and central bankers have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-government-central-bank-come-to-consensus-on-crypto.htm">claimed they are close to issuing a draft crypto regulation bill</a>, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-ministries-discuss-crypto-mining-legalization-but-theres-a-twist.htm">industrial miners urging a faster rollout for legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine announced that a serving lawmaker will stand trial after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ukrainian-lawmaker-to-face-trial-over-alleged-bitcoin-bribes.htm">allegedly trying to bribe a public official with Bitcoin</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Yuga Labs sold the IP rights of two of its games, Legends of the Mara and HV-MTL, to Web3 gaming firm Faraway on April 17 in a strategic move designed to refocus the organization. The decision was accompanied by a key change in leadership.</span></p>
<p><span>Yuga Labs simultaneously announced that Spencer Trucker, its chief gaming officer, would join Faraway as its new chief product officer. This move is structured to maintain continuity between the two companies and their games.</span></p>

<p>The XRP (XRP) price is struggling to keep up with a broader crypto market rebound on Thursday, rising just 1.4% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap versus gains of 3.5% for Bitcoin (BTC) and 4.5% for Solana (SOL), with XRP’s market cap having recently slipped below that of US dollar stablecoin Circle USD (USDC).</p>
<p>Down more than 20% on the month and trading just above $0.50, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP’s</a> market cap was last around $27.67 billion. That’s nearly $4.5 billion less than USDC’s market cap of just over $33 billion. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/xrp-price-prediction/">XRP’s</a> coin ranking it now number 7, with USDC taking the 6<sup>th</sup> spot.</p>
<p>The XRP price dumped hard earlier in the month amid a sharp altcoin sell-off. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-crash-as-iranian-drone-attack-on-israel-sparks-sell-off.htm">Geopolitics was the catalyst for the sell-off at the time</a>, but macro headwinds have blocked a full recovery.</p>
<p>And XRP’s fortunes could yet worsen, with the cryptocurrency having broken below a key long-term uptrend.</p>
<h2><strong>XRP Price Prediction – Here’s Where XRP Is Headed Next</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
XRP’s sharp drop earlier this month saw the cryptocurrency break below an uptrend that had been in play going all the way back to early 2023.</p>
<p>Since the break of this trendline, the XRP bears have already hit three major price targets. Those were at $0.4850, $0.46 and $0.43, with bears likely to eye $0.40 next.</p>
<p>That target could well get hit is Bitcoin succumbs to a post-halving sell-the-fact reaction, and macro headwinds keep building.</p>

<h2><strong>XRP Alternative to Consider – 5thScape (5SCAPE)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
XRP’s near-term technical outlook is ugly. The token may well continue to keep pace with its better-performing rivals for the remainder of 2024.</p>
<p>After all, Bitcoin sits at the forefront of global adoption in wake of recent US spot ETF approvals. ETH, while still facing regulatory risk, is a much more dynamic chain and remains the major home of DeFi.</p>
<p>Investors looking to take their first steps into the crypto market would likely do better choosing either of these two.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for more risk-tolerant investors looking to secure higher gains, a good strategy to consider is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-a-crypto-presale/">presale</a> investing.</p>
<p>Up-and-coming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-web3/">web3</a> projects often conduct fundraising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token.</p>
<p>These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ico-news/">presale</a> investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket.</p>
<p>But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains.</p>
<p>One project that analysts at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-ethereum-icos/">Cryptonews</a> think has a good chance of delivering short-term gains is AR/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-vr-crypto.htm">VR</a> innovator <a href="https://5thscape.com/">5thScape</a> (5SCAPE).</p>
<h2><strong>5thScape (5SCAPE) – 2024’s Most Promising Presale?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
First-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR/AR project 5thScape (5SCAPE) has already raised over $5 million so far. 5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="5th Scape: A Data-Driven Journey through the VR Industry Landscape" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxiKYV3RzQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Priced at just $0.00327, a steep discount versus the token’s planned launch price of $0.1, investors who get involved now can lock in paper gains of 200%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is set to become one of the first nations to adopt the International Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) for taxation by 2026, as outlined in a supplement to the country&#8217;s 2024 annual budget, as reported by the National Post on April 16.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Tax Reporting In Canada</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to the framework in August 2022 and is scheduled to be implemented in 47 countries by 2027, <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/media-release/collective-engagement-implement-crypto-asset-reporting-framework">as pledged in November 2023</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Just as crypto-assets pose financial risks to middle-class Canadians, the rapid growth of crypto-asset markets poses significant risks of tax evasion,” the <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/full-text-canada-2024-federal-budget">2024 federal budget states</a>. &#8220;Regulation and the international exchange of tax information must keep pace with tax evasion threats to ensure a fair tax system.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Impact on Canada Crypto Service Providers</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The CARF places new reporting requirements on “crypto asset service providers” (CASPs) including crypto exchanges, brokers, and ATM operators. Stablecoins, derivatives issued as crypto tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are included as examples of “crypto assets.”</p>
<p>Crypto asset service providers (CASPs), such as exchanges and ATM operators, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-providers-in-canada-must-report-transfers-by-2027.htm">will be obligated to report various transactions to the CRA</a>. This includes crypto-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto transactions and any crypto transfers exceeding $50,000 USD, encompassing payment processing activities.</p>
<p>CASPs must also collect information on their customers, including “name, address, date of birth, jurisdiction(s) of residence, and taxpayer identification numbers for each jurisdiction of residence.”</p>
<p>Transactions of both Canadian residents and non-residents will require reporting.</p>
<p>“Budget 2024 proposes to provide $51.6 million over five years, starting in 2024-25, and $7.3 million per year ongoing to the Canada Revenue Agency for the implementation and administration of these initiatives,” the budget reads.</p>
<h2><strong>Canada’s Capital Gains Hike</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The budget plan also includes a proposal to raise the capital gains tax inclusion rate from 50% to 66% for annual incomes exceeding $250,000. This change, which applies to cryptocurrency sales, has sparked concerns within the Canadian crypto community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip below $63,000, an April 18 report by technical analyst Ali Martinez revealed a surge in BTC accumulation, signifying resilience among Bitcoin holders.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin braces for its Upcoming Halving Event; Volatility Continues to Mark its Trajectory</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1780884109763449039">Ali Martinez highlighted this trend on X</a>, showcasing a chart depicting the movement of over 27,700 BTC (approximately $1.72 billion) into accumulation addresses.</p>
<p>This influx amidst Bitcoin&#8217;s price dip represents a new all-time high, exceeding the previous record of 25,100 BTC on March 22, 2024, and signifying anticipation of future gains among investors.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Over 27,700 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a>, worth around $1.72 billion, have flown into accumulation addresses as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> dropped below $63,000! <a href="https://t.co/ksrk0qNp41">pic.twitter.com/ksrk0qNp41</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This trend is further supported by <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/661fd2b12bbda620d3f6123d-Bitcoin-inflows-to-the-Accumulation-Addresses-hit-a-new-all-time-high?">data from CryptoQuant</a>, which indicates a record-high inflow of Bitcoin into accumulation addresses. Surpassing previous highs, this data indicates a notable shift towards long-term holding strategies among investors.</p>
<p>Defined by specific criteria, including balances exceeding 10 BTC, no outgoing transactions, and exclusion of exchange or miner-associated accounts, these BTC accumulation addresses suggest a strategic pivot towards long-term holding despite market fluctuations.</p>
<p>The surge in accumulation signals enduring confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential, positioning it for a re-accumulation phase in the coming months after halving.</p>
<h2><strong>BTC Accumulation and Post-Halving Predictions</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, crypto analyst &#8216;Rekt Capital&#8217; proposes that Bitcoin&#8217;s current correction phase may soon give way to a re-accumulation period post-halving. Historical patterns suggest that a BTC accumulation phase often leads to a period of price consolidation following halving events. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a></p>
<p>3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving</p>
<p>1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace</p>
<p>Bitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a month</p>
<p>In mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% again</p>
<p>This… <a href="https://t.co/2BKBQXpPOV">pic.twitter.com/2BKBQXpPOV</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) <a href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1780664769692786834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price typically remains range-bound for approximately five months post-halving, similar to what we observed in previous cycles. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could trade within the high $50k range until around October, reflecting a consolidation phase before potential upward momentum.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis and Resistance Levels</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading slightly below $64,000, marking a marginal increase of 4.3% within the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Jason Pizzino, a renowned crypto analyst, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWfQ5GEIUeo">offered insights into Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements</a> as well, identifying key resistance levels at $67,000, $69,000, and $71,000. He emphasizes the importance of a BTC accumulation and consolidation above $67,000 for sustained bullish momentum.</p>
<p>However, Pizzino also warns of potential downside risks if Bitcoin fails to maintain support above the $59,000 to $60,000 range, potentially leading to a correction towards the low to mid $50,000 range or even lower.</p>
<p>Pizzino uses historical data to contextualize current market dynamics, drawing parallels to past halving events and aiding investor decision-making. His analysis echoes Rekt Capital&#8217;s observations regarding the potential BTC accumulation and price fluctuations following halvings.</p>
<p>Recent data also indicates substantial <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-spot-etfs-see-net-outflow-of-58m-gbtc-leads-outflows.htm">capital outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, notably Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</a>, contributing to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s decline.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/miners-could-offload-5-billion-bitcoin-following-halving.htm">Bitcoin miners&#8217; continuous selling</a> before and after the halving event exerts additional downward pressure on the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent prediction revealed on April 17, crypto analyst &#8220;Plan B&#8221; forecasted that the Bitcoin price would surpass $300,000 by 2025, with expectations of reaching $100,000 by December 2024.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Moonshot Prediction is Fueled by the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1780586891735101653">Plan B shared their forecast on X</a>, emphasizing the positive influence of Halvings on BTC&#8217;s price. They believe the upcoming Halving will be no different.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">IMO this bitcoin halving will NOT be different:<br />&#8211; All bitcoin price increase will again be around the halving<br />&#8211; Buying 6m before the halving and selling 18m after the halving (green line) will outperform buy&amp;hold<br />&#8211; BTC &gt; $100k in 2024<br />&#8211; BTC top &gt; $300k in 2025 <a href="https://t.co/lCZjnuoYMO">pic.twitter.com/lCZjnuoYMO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1780586891735101653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halvings occurs every four years</a>, reducing the rate at which new coins are created by half.</p>
<p>Plan B&#8217;s prediction is based on the <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/pro/i/S2F">Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model</a>, which evaluates Bitcoin&#8217;s scarcity by comparing the circulating supply (stock) to the new supply entering the market (flow).</p>
<p>According to the S2F model, as the supply of new Bitcoins decreases due to halving events, the scarcity of Bitcoin increases, potentially leading to higher prices.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price is expected to benefit from the increasing scarcity after the halving event and the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, such as via <a href="https://etp.coinshares.com/knowledge/market-activity/fund-flows-15-04-24">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> and because of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-suspends-bitcoin-ordinals-trading.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Plan B shared insight regarding the timing of buying and selling Bitcoin around the halving event. The idea is rooted in the concept that Bitcoin&#8217;s price typically rises leading up to and following a halving event due to the reduction in supply.</p>
<p>BTC traders tend to capitalize on the anticipated price increase by purchasing Bitcoin just before the halving, while the prediction to sell shortly after the halving, within a timeframe of around &#8220;18 minutes,&#8221; is based on the notion that the BTC price surges immediately after the halving event.</p>
<p>Plan B further explained that this strategy outperforms the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp#:~:text=Buy%20and%20hold%20is%20a%20long%2Dterm%20passive%20strategy%20where,typically%20defer%20capital%20gains%20taxes.">conventional &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; trade concept</a>, which involves holding onto Bitcoin for a long period regardless of short-term price fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agree, bitcoin must take out gold because it will have 2x scarcity/S2F. My &quot;BTC top &gt; $300k&quot; is the low end of the $250k-$1m range. Last cycle I took the high end and BTC decided to go low end, let&#39;s see how this will work out.</p>
<p>&mdash; PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1780591295326552075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Plan B also expressed sentiment that Bitcoin will perform better than gold, stating that Bitcoin’s scarcity will be twice that of gold after the halving, and the initial $300K price projection is conservative within its estimated range of $250,000 to $1 million.</p>

Plan B&#8217;s Bitcoin forecast aligns with other experts in the field. Ark Invest&#8217;s Cathie Wood, Standard Chartered Bank, and New York best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki are all optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory post-halving.</p>
<p>During the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22, Cathie Wood forecasted that BTC&#8217;s price could soar to $2.3 million per coin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Bank raised its year-end forecast to $150,000, projecting a peak of $250,000 in 2025 before it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-may-boost-bitcoin-to-200000-in-2025-standard-chartered-bank-predicts.htm">settles around $200,000</a>. Recall that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-to-hit-100k-by-june-predicts-robert-kiyosaki.htm">Kiyosaki predicted the Bitcoin price to rise to $100K by June 2024</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Notably, <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/finance-bridge-spot-btc-etf-impact/">Glassnode predicted that spot Bitcoin ETFs would be major catalysts to pump BTC&#8217;s price in 2024</a>, with around $70 billion of new capital projected to enter the market via these Bitcoin products.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price is currently trading around $63,400 <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">marking a 3.46% rise in the last 24 hours</a>. As the Bitcoin halving approaches, Bitcoin enthusiasts and global communities eagerly anticipate a potential bullish run.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates within its recent $60,000-70,000ish ranges ahead of its fourth quadrennial halving event this weekend, traders are looking for alternative investment opportunities that could deliver strong returns.</p>
<p>One opportunity that is garnering lots of hype is Bitcoin education platform 99Bitcoins exciting pivot into the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-learn-earn-can-change-way-of-learning.htm">learn-to-earn</a> (L2E) space.</p>
<p>99Bitcoins produces courses to help investors make their first steps into the crypto space. It currently has over 100,000 enrolled students.</p>

<p>99Bitcoins is launching with a new L2E token ($99BTC) that is designed to reward individuals for learning about cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The classic 99Bitcoins platform is integrating with BRC-20 to pioneer the L2E model on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/99BitcoinsHQ/status/1778062722652860797</p>
<p>$99BTC is currently available in an exciting presale that has already raked in close to $500,000 in one week.</p>

<h2><strong>How 99Bitcoins’ L2E Platform Works</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
99Bitcoins uses a blend of gamification and a leaderboard reward system to pay out rewards for engagement. The idea of “learn-to-earn” rests on the simple premise that users will be incentivized to learn more if learning bears tangible (spendable) benefits.</p>
<p>The gamification aspect comes about through various different learning resources, like interactive learning modules, quizzes, and tutorials. Successful completion of these challenges raises a users’ <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/99bitcoins">99Bitcoins</a> rankings. The higher the ranking, the greater the payout.</p>
<p>Users unlock more courses as they progress through the exercises, which means more rewards in a self-motivating and immersive experience that stays engaging and enjoyable for users of all levels of crypto knowledge.</p>
<p>For today’s highly switched-on and video game and smartphone palming generation, it’s more familiar than textbooks.</p>
<p>99Bitcoins platform will offer comprehensive curricula on various topics at all levels, from wallet basics and how-to guides all the way through to trading signals, strategies, trends, and technical knowledge.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Prelaunch 99Bitcoins Learn 2 Earn On BRC-20 - Early Buyers Become Millionaires (HUGE POTENTIAL)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqz4Dt085rQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Exciting L2E Bitcoin Project $99BTC – 2024’s Best Crypto Presale</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
99Bitcoins is making 10.5% of the supply of its $99BTC token available to early investors in the presale.</p>
<p>Tokens are currently up for grabs for $0.00101, giving the token a current market cap of under $100 million.</p>
<p>Given 99Bitcoins’ huge community and potential to become a leader in the fast-growing L2E space, that could be a bargain.</p>
<p>14% of the token supply is being reserved for staking rewards. That means that early $99BTC investors not only have the opportunity to benefit from price appreciation, but also passive income.</p>
<p>APYs for presale investors are currently sat at an insane 4,000%, according to 99Bitcoins’ official X account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has established a commanding market presence, edging closer to the dominance of Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to data released on April 17.</p>
<h2>IBIT&#8217;s Impressive Growth in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3430945/5762640">Dune data</a> shows that IBIT boasts $19 billion worth of Bitcoin with a current market share of 32.6%, inching closer to GBTC&#8217;s 36.8% market share. This report comes amid IBIT&#8217;s second-lowest daily inflows of $24.9 million since its launch.</p>
<p>IBIT was approved on January 10, and its current market share highlights an impressive growth sequence. Since then, BlackRock ETF Bitcoin holdings have grown by over 10,200%, amassing 272,550 BTC valued at $16.8 billion. The fund needs about $2.2 billion to close in on Grayscale’s holdings.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blackrock&#39;s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, now holds 272,844 BTC, up 296 from the last trading day</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Grayscale&#8217;s market share has plummeted substantially following the conversion of its GBTC into an ETF. Before the conversion, Grayscale held about 620,000 BTC, but its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscales-bitcoin-holdings-drop-by-33.htm">holdings have dropped by over 45% since then</a>. Grayscale&#8217;s holdings stand at 308,105 BTC as of writing.</p>
<p>IBIT&#8217;s impressive attainment has sparked M&amp;A discussions, with some analysts suggesting that an <a href="https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/status/1780854274072989704">IBIT takeover could be around the corner</a>.</p>
<p>While both ETFs have had a slowdown in accumulation and selling patterns in recent weeks, IBIT&#8217;s $866 million net inflows on March 13 and GBTC&#8217;s $607 million outflows on March 19 (its fourth-largest since inception) suggest that the broader market sentiment might be shifting in favor of BlackRock.</p>

<p>Additionally, GBTC&#8217;s high trading fee of 1.5% – the highest among all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers could impact patronage. In contrast, BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT charges a modest 0.25% fee, while Franklin Templeton&#8217;s ETF offers an even lower fee of 0.19%.</p>
<p>Despite IBIT&#8217;s notable growth, the spot Bitcoin ETFs market has experienced dwindling net inflows recently.</p>
<h2>Volatility Amid the Battle for Spot Bitcoin ETF Dominance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://farside.co.uk/?p=997">According to data from Farside Investors</a>, IBIT recorded net inflows of $73.4 million on April 15, lower than the previous day&#8217;s inflow of $111.1 million.</p>
<p>However, aside from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, the other eight ETFs reported no inflows during that period, which contributed to BlackRock&#8217;s growing market share in the Bitcoin ETF segment.</p>
<p>The ten-spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $91.8 million between April 12 and April 15. These outflows coincided with a volatile week for Bitcoin, which saw a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">9.54% price drop to about $63,000</a> as of writing.</p>
<p>Globally, Bitcoin investment products experienced $110 million in outflow between April 12 and 17, indicating investor &#8220;hesitancy,&#8221; <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-178-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-02e978e7d82e">according to CoinShares&#8217; James Butterfill</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>1. TodayTrader – Overall Best Crypto Patreon Group</strong></h3>
<p>For those seeking to master crypto trading strategies, look no further than the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TodayTrader">TodayTrader</a> Patreon group. Helmed by Mark Kelly, a stock trader turned crypto investor, this community offers all members a comprehensive suite of benefits.</p>

<p>Additionally, TodayTrader’s Patreon grants early access to exclusive content, including video posts and trade alerts, ensuring members are the first to know about potential market-moving events.

<p>But TodayTrader goes beyond just sharing knowledge: there’s also a strong focus on community. Through interactive features like patron-only voting and live trading rooms, members can engage with their peers, exchange ideas, and learn from a collective pool of expertise.</p>
<p>Multiple pricing tiers exist, from the $1/month &#8220;Crypto Enthusiast&#8221; level for those seeking basic access to the all-encompassing $97/month &#8220;Crypto Partner&#8221; tier. This latter tier unlocks exclusive benefits, including personal setup calls, weekly mastermind sessions, and much more.</p>
<p>So, whether you&#8217;re looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending cryptocurrencies</a> or are interested in meeting like-minded people, the TodayTrader Patreon group promises to be an invaluable resource.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Jacob’s Crypto Clan</strong> – <strong>Popular Crypto Patreon Group for Real-Time Trading Signals</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/jacobcryptobury/">Jacob&#8217;s Crypto Clan</a> is another of the top crypto Patreon groups to consider. Led by Jacob Bury, who happens to have one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-youtube-channels.htm">best crypto YouTube channels</a> with over 37,000 subscribers, this group offers trading insights, educational resources, and a network of investors all looking to improve their skills.</p>
<p>This group promises regular trading signals for both spot and leverage trading. These signals are crafted by Jacob and allow members to take advantage of market opportunities as soon as they arise. With up to 500 signals per month (for the Crypto Legend tier), members get a steady flow of potential opportunities.</p>
<p>Beyond signals, Jacob’s Crypto Clan is a group that supports traders of all levels. Newcomers can benefit from the educational resources, including video tutorials, live classrooms, and an e-book created by Jacob himself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199034" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093754/1713260274-jacobs-crypto-clan.png" alt="Jacob's Crypto Clan Patreon group" width="1212" height="680" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093754/1713260274-jacobs-crypto-clan.png 1212w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093754/1713260274-jacobs-crypto-clan-300x168.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093754/1713260274-jacobs-crypto-clan-1024x575.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093754/1713260274-jacobs-crypto-clan-768x431.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093754/1713260274-jacobs-crypto-clan-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px" /></p>
<p>Higher membership tiers unlock additional benefits for those seeking exclusivity and early access. From presale whitelisting to insider info on ultra-low-cap projects, members can get in on the ground floor of promising ventures before the masses do.</p>
<p>However, what truly sets Jacob’s Crypto Clan apart is the sense of community it offers. This Patreon has one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-discord-groups.htm">best crypto Discord groups</a> on our list, where members can engage in lively discussions and build connections with fellow crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Finally, Jacob&#8217;s Crypto Clan caters to diverse needs and budgets with multiple price tiers ranging from $10.50 to $103.50 per month. For that reason, it&#8217;s undoubtedly one of the best crypto Patreon groups to subscribe to this year.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong>3. Crypto Gains</strong> – <strong>Huge Crypto Patreon Group with Tiers for Every Budget</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Cryptogains">Crypto Gains</a> Patreon group is another option for new and experienced investors. Led by a charismatic and passionate YouTuber, this group offers real-time alerts, in-depth analysis, and a network of retail investors.</p>
<p>Like the two groups discussed above, Crypto Gains offers buy, sell, and take-profit alerts. These alerts provide a glimpse into the creator&#8217;s trading activities, allowing members to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>But Crypto Gains goes further than trading signals. The community offers educational resources like crypto guides, tutorials, and spreadsheets. From understanding technical analysis to mastering trading strategies, these resources help traders of all experience levels navigate the crypto market effectively.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199028" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093727/1713260247-crypto-gains.png" alt="Crypto Gains Patreon group" width="863" height="647" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093727/1713260247-crypto-gains.png 863w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093727/1713260247-crypto-gains-300x225.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093727/1713260247-crypto-gains-768x576.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093727/1713260247-crypto-gains-150x112.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p>However, what truly sets Crypto Gains apart is the sense of exclusivity it provides. Through the &#8220;VIP Lounge&#8221; and &#8220;Stealth Buy Alerts&#8221; sections, higher-tier members gain early access to content before it reaches the broader public. This exclusivity offers a potential advantage in a market where timing is everything.</p>
<p>Crypto Gains&#8217; pricing tiers range from $1.50/month to $551.50/month, ensuring an option for every budget alongside his free <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-youtube-channels.htm">crypto YouTube</a> videos.</p>

<p>Although Krypto Cove posts less regularly than the three Patreon groups mentioned above, it is still an excellent resource for those seeking to unlock the potential of the DeFi space. For that reason, Krypto Cove is suitable for all investors, regardless of their experience level.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Crypto Seth</strong> – <strong>Well-Known YouTuber Offering Crypto Patreon Group</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto Seth’s Patreon community is all about gaining an edge in the crypto market. This isn’t just another place to get generic content – it’s an inner circle where members receive real-time alerts on buying, selling, accumulating, and staking opportunities directly from Seth himself.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Find the Best Crypto Patreon Groups</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finding the best crypto Patreon group to join can be a challenging task, since there are hundreds of options to choose from. Here are some strategies to help identify groups that align with your goals and preferences:</p>
<h3><strong>Leverage the Crypto Network</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto community is tight-knit, and word-of-mouth can be a powerful tool. Reach out to fellow enthusiasts, traders, or investors on social media and ask for recommendations. A good resource would be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-twitter-accounts.htm">best crypto Twitter accounts</a>, which tend to have a grasp on popular educational resources in the space.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199031" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093740/1713260260-use-twitter.png" alt="TodayTrader Twitter" width="653" height="498" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093740/1713260260-use-twitter.png 653w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093740/1713260260-use-twitter-300x229.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093740/1713260260-use-twitter-150x114.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Scour Reddit &amp; Discord</strong></h3>
<p>Following on from the recommendations on Twitter, dive into crypto-focused Reddit threads and Discord servers to find mentions of top-rated Patreon groups. Communities on these platforms tend to openly discuss (and criticize) influential traders and analysts. Look for recurring mentions of specific creators – this is usually a good sign.</p>
<h3><strong>Evaluate the Creator’s Reputation</strong></h3>
<p>Before committing to a Patreon group, research the creator or team behind it. Look for factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry experience and expertise</li>
<li>Consistent track record of delivering value</li>
<li>Transparency and commitment to ethical practices</li>
<li>Engagement with the community</li>
<li>Responsiveness to feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Reputable creators often have a strong online presence, whether on Twitter or Instagram, making it easier to assess their value.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider Your Specific Needs &amp; Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, different Patreon groups cater to various needs and investment styles. Some may focus on technical analysis, while others prioritize uncovering the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coins/">best meme coins to buy</a>.</p>
<p>This is why it’s crucial to identify your goals ahead of time. Are you a seasoned trader seeking an edge, a newcomer looking to learn the basics, or an investor interested solely in low-cap tokens?</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of content and resources offered (analysis, signals, tutorials, etc.)</li>
<li>Level of access and exclusivity (tiers, early releases, private Discord servers)</li>
<li>Community engagement and networking opportunities</li>
<li>Pricing and value proposition</li>
</ul>
<p>By considering these factors, you’ll be better equipped to sift through the best crypto Patreon groups and find ones that truly resonate with your needs.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Join Cryptocurrency Patreon Groups?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As highlighted in this guide, joining a Patreon crypto group can provide access to top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-trading-strategies/">crypto trading strategies</a>, real-time signals, and a wealth of educational materials. But these are just some of the benefits.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at why you may wish to use a crypto Patreon teacher in 2024:</p>
<h3><strong>Gain an Informational Edge</strong></h3>
<p>Access to timely and accurate information can be the difference in the crypto market. Crypto Patreon groups offer a direct line to insiders, analysts, and experienced traders who can provide insights that may not be readily available elsewhere.</p>
<p>Just like having a knowledgeable guide on a hike through unfamiliar terrain, these groups can help you navigate the crypto market with confidence.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199036" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093803/1713260283-informational-edge.png" alt="jacob bury Patreon" width="732" height="687" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093803/1713260283-informational-edge.png 732w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093803/1713260283-informational-edge-300x282.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093803/1713260283-informational-edge-150x141.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Stay Ahead of the Curve</strong></h3>
<p>As most traders will know, the crypto market moves fast, with new projects and technologies emerging all the time. Patreon groups can act as an early “warning system,” keeping you informed about the latest developments, risks, and opportunities before they hit the mainstream.</p>
<p>For example, the rise of <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-are-real-world-assets-rwa/#:~:text=Real%20World%20Assets%20(RWAs)%20are,properties%2C%20commodities%2C%20and%20machinery.">Real World Assets (RWAs)</a> was likely discussed on Patreon long before gaining widespread attention. Considering RWAs have become one of the biggest crypto narratives of the year so far, this highlights the value of being part of a well-established Patreon group.</p>
<h3><strong>Access Exclusive Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>Many top-tier Patreon groups offer their members exclusive access to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a>, airdrops, and other lucrative opportunities that may be unavailable to the general public. For example, members of the “Crypto Champion” tier on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jacobcryptobury">Jacob’s Crypto Clan</a> received early access to projects that soared over 1,900% from their presale price.</p>
<p>This level of exclusivity can be thought of as having a backstage pass to a concert. You get to experience something truly unique and potentially valuable, while the masses do not.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199030" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093736/1713260255-community-and-networking.png" alt="crypto Patreon group" width="1015" height="437" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093736/1713260255-community-and-networking.png 1015w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093736/1713260255-community-and-networking-300x129.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093736/1713260255-community-and-networking-768x331.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16093736/1713260255-community-and-networking-150x65.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Community &amp; Networking</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the informational benefits, crypto Patreon groups serve as communities where like-minded individuals can connect, share ideas, and learn from one another. This peer-to-peer interaction can be invaluable – especially for those new to the crypto world.</p>
<p>Additionally, joining a Patreon group can open up opportunities for direct engagement with industry experts. A great example is the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TodayTrader">TodayTrader Patreon group</a>, where members of the &#8220;Crypto Partner&#8221; tier receive weekly mastermind sessions with Mark Kelly.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto Patreon Groups &#8211; Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To conclude, navigating the crypto market can be daunting, especially for beginners. That&#8217;s why joining a reputable and well-established Patreon group is often a wise move.</p>
<p>We recommend checking out the TodayTrader Patreon group, which offers many benefits for novice and experienced traders. From regular trading signals to direct engagement with industry experts, this community provides the tools necessary to succeed in crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) faces dimming enthusiasm as the price of the popular payments-focused Bitcoin fork dipped 20% over the last seven days to trade at <span>$484 as of this writing. </span></p>
<p>Like the rest of the market, BCH appears to be tracking market leader <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, which fell 9% over the last week to trade for around <span>$63,650, at the time of writing.</span></p>
<p><span>Growing turmoil in the Middle East after an Iranian <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-13/bitcoin-btc-steadies-after-sinking-most-since-2023-on-iran-attack?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">attack</a> on Israel last weekend prompted the sell-off, which has now slowed down. </span></p>
<p>The two Bitcoins are now in the green again after the last 24 hours added 5% and 7% to BTC and BCH respectively.</p>
<p>Investors are stocking up ahead of Bitcoin&#8217;s quadrennial halving on Saturday. That&#8217;s the day when a software update will halve BTC mining rewards.</p>
<p>History suggests we&#8217;re on the cusp of a bull run. The previous three halvings have all increased the price of the original cryptocurrency as the halved supply struggled to meet consistent demand. There are some fears, however, that this year the halving may have already been priced in.</p>
<p>However, BCH&#8217;s price chart for the last three months tells a very different story to its namesake.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies began a rally that peaked by the middle.</p>
<p>BCH initially rallied in step with them, but the momentum fell by March 3.</p>

<p>On the other end of the chart, BCH rallied from late March to early April, independent of Bitcoin, which remained stagnant over the same period.</p>
<h2>How Bitcoin Cash Differs to Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span></span>Back in 2017, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called<span> </span><span>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. </span></p>
<p>The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which allow the network to process more transactions per second.</p>
<p>However, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business. This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations.</p>
<p>The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments. The original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value.</p>
<h2>Betting on Bitcoin? Why Not Gamble With Megadice?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The uncertainty around Bitcoin&#8217;s halving underscores the volatility of crypto in general. It is still very much a bet, although early projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are a safer bet than others.</p>
<p>Still, the crypto world abounds with plenty of useful applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future. One such application is the world of GambleFi.</p>
<p>A new ICO for Solana GameFi token Mega Dice (DICE) started this week and it has already raised <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-solana-gamblefi-token-mega-dice-raises-300000-in-crypto-presale.htm">over $300,000</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MEGA DICE CASINO IS A NEW GAMEFI GEM!! $DICE CAN 100X NEW PRESALE GEM!!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUOcsi8YYtE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>DICE is the native token for Mega Dice’s Telegram-based crypto casino, with certain games requiring the token to play. It can also be used for staking <span>casino cashback, airdrop prizes, and special NFT benefits.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) posted seven-day depreciation of as much as 50% in 24 hours by the morning of Thursday, April 18, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">data</a> by CoinGecko, although its intraweek losses have since slowed to about 31% as of this writing.</p>
<p>Among meme coins, WIF took some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide downturn that has shaved double digit percentages off virtually every leading cryptocurrency in the last week.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DOGWIFHAT RECOVERY?! ARE DOG COINS DYING?? DOGWIFHAT PRICE PREDICTION!!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULCOOo96L68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Leading meme coins fell by comparable amounts this week: sector leader <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> (DOGE) lost 25%, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/shib-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB) dropped 19.5%, PEPE shed 28%, FLOKI crashed 30% and BONK is down hardest (35%) among the 10 largest funny tokens by market cap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) led the losses with a 12% drop over the week and trades at just under $62k. The original cryptocurrency was buffeted by a stormy news cycle that began last weekend when Iran <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-13/bitcoin-btc-steadies-after-sinking-most-since-2023-on-iran-attack?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">attacked</a> Israel in retaliation for a strike in Syria that killed Iranian soldiers.</p>
<p>Additionally, volatility has increased a little ahead of Saturday&#8217;s Bitcoin halving event, a software update that will halve BTC mining rewards.</p>
<p>The halving effectively chokes the new supply of Bitcoin and has many analysts suggesting an imminent bull run as the supply struggles to keep up with fresh institutional demand from the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January.</p>
<p>Substantial Bitcoin price drops typically signal a market-wide dip. Today virtually every leading cryptocurrency is posting double-digit losses over the week.</p>
<h2>Move Over DogWifHat, Solana&#8217;s New Star is a Sloth</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meme coins have an edge on every other crypto category on Saturday, because Bitcoin&#8217;s halving coincidentally falls on April 20, international Doge Day.<br />
<span></span></p>
<p>The Dogecoin community selected Doge Day to commemorate their favorite coin, but given the competition in crypto, many expect canine-related meme coins to get a look-in that day.</p>
<p>April 20 is also the day stoners commemorate their favorite hobby, and a new novelty coin on Solana hopes to challenge canine dominance that day.</p>
<p><span>Enter Slothana (SLOTH). From the clock on the wall to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is one of 4/20’s biggest fans. </span></p>

<p>Pepe Birthday is a celebratory meme coin, aiming to make it big in the wake of 2023&#8217;s biggest meme coin launch: Pepe coin &#8211; which was created on April 19.</p>
<h2><strong>PEPEBDAY Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin Celebrates PEPE&#8217;s First Birthday &#8211; How High Will Pump Go?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action retreats, Pepe Birthday token is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/Cprpuy7xpgJMKa2ErMxZao1GgU2v9pYSqRuHbVdnQw7b?t=1713437930330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.000032</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -90%).</p>
<p>This comes after PEPEBDAY launched at just 9 AM UTC on April 17, in a listing that garnered immediate attention from eagle-eyed DEX traders.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-200321 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18113911/1713440351-pepebday_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-04-18_12-39-05.png" alt="PEPEBDAY Price Analysis: As markets brace for Bitcoin Halving, PEPE Birthday token has exploded 200x in Solana meme coin vertical - read here" width="1473" height="592" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18113911/1713440351-pepebday_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-04-18_12-39-05.png 1473w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18113911/1713440351-pepebday_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-04-18_12-39-05-300x121.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18113911/1713440351-pepebday_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-04-18_12-39-05-1024x412.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18113911/1713440351-pepebday_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-04-18_12-39-05-768x309.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18113911/1713440351-pepebday_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-04-18_12-39-05-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1473px) 100vw, 1473px" /></p>
<p>Quickfire traction saw PEPEBDAY accelerate +14,000% to hit an all-time high at $0.0076 just 5-hours later &#8211; yet, the sudden gains appear to have been short-lived, with early-bird investors moving quick for a sell-off that has since bled-out most of Yesterday&#8217;s big gains.</p>
<p>Pepe Birthday token is now left trading at last-stand support above $0.00003 &#8211; with 1,220 holders risking a complete capitulation.</p>
<p>And despite the timely launch, and alluringly low $32k market cap &#8211; with buy pressure representing just 35% of transactions over the past hour &#8211; all might be over for this fresh-faced moonshot.</p>
<p>For this reason, many astute traders are shifting their attention to a viral meme coin presale.</p>

<p>DOGEVERSE will operate on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, a multichain feature that supporters will drive prices in 2024.</p>
<p>Moreover, holders cite DOGEVERSE’s capped supply of 200 million combined with staking as attractive attributes. These features will likely create a supply squeeze, progressively lifting prices over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As cryptocurrency prices bounce on Thursday in wake of the bulls putting up a strong defense of the $60,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and $3,000 Ether (ETH) levels a day earlier, investors are hunting for smaller, lesser-known altcoins that could be the best crypto to buy now to deliver quick gains.</p>
<p>The world’s two largest cryptocurrencies <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> were both threatening breakouts below key psychologically important levels earlier this week.</p>
<p>Many traders have become more pessimistic about the near-term outlook given rising macro and geopolitical headwinds ahead of the halving. But Bitcoin has since rebounded to near $64,000 and Ether to near $3,100.</p>

<h2><strong>Crypto Defies Bearish Sentiment as Market Frothiness Declines</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But crypto prices have a habit of moving in the opposite direction that the crowd expects.</p>
<p>As per research firm Santiment, &#8220;the #bullmarket has essentially come to an end after #Bitcoin&#8217;s -16% market value drop since the #AllTimeHigh of $73,600 hit back on March 14<sup>th</sup>”.</p>
<p>“At the same time, #bearmarket mentions are increasing,” <a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/bull-market-calls-have-evaporated-while-bear-market-calls-grow-a-positive-sign-7749">Santiment</a> continued in a research note.</p>
<p>Mentions of the “buy the dip” have also declined, which Santiment notes often market the end of downtrends.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4c8.png" alt="📈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Crypto</a> markets have seen a boost today, as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>  has jumped back to $63.8K with just over 36 hours until its <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/halving?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#halving</a> event. The crowd has maintained a consistently <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bearish?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bearish</a> sentiment toward top caps, which strengthens the argument for more rising. <a href="https://t.co/fPmv7gAQli">https://t.co/fPmv7gAQli</a> <a href="https://t.co/mAIZa8c5jJ">pic.twitter.com/mAIZa8c5jJ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Frothy sentiment in amongst retail trades has clearly subsided. That’s also evident when looking at futures market.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate">coinglass.com</a>, the funding rate paid by traders taking out leveraged Bitcoin long positions recently dipped to multi-month lows.<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest"> Open interest</a> (i.e. the USD value of outstanding leveraged futures positions) has also declined substantially from recent highs.</p>
<p>A less frothy market suggests a more stable foundation from which the Bitcoin price can stage a rebound. That could explain the strength of Thursday’s rally, which has likely caught some off guard.</p>
<p>With many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-altcoins/">altcoins</a> well down from recent highs but the market now rebounding, the potential is there for quick gains.</p>
<p>Here are some strong-performing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-are-altcoins/">altcoins</a> on Thursday that could be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Injective (INJ)</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized trading protocol Injective (INJ) is gaining momentum as the market rebounds and is eyeing a retest of $30 resistance.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/injective/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the token was last up around 14% in 24 hours, with a $2.7 billion market cap.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stake <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24INJ&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$INJ</a> and Chill <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1fae1.png" alt="🫡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Uu8gAEkueD">https://t.co/Uu8gAEkueD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Injective <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f977.png" alt="🥷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@injective) <a href="https://twitter.com/injective/status/1780746666812887338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>No specific catalyst appears behind the cryptos outperformance. However, news that the number of staked INJ tokens continues to rise is a good sign for the protocol.</p>
<p>Its modest valuation suggests there remains plenty of room for the crypto to 5 or 10x from here. It could easily be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h3><strong>Gala (GALA)</strong></h3>
<p>Play-to-earn blockchain gaming platform Gala (GALA) is attempting to continue a rebound from its recent dip.</p>
<p>Last at $0.04380, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gala/">GALA</a> is up 12% in 24 hours and 30% from last week’s sub-$0.033 lows.</p>
<p>The GALA price got crushed last week amid the broader market sell-off and after bearish pennant breakout.</p>
<figure id="attachment_200498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-200498" style="width: 817px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-200498" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18161615/1713456975-screenshot-2024-04-18-110231.png" alt="GALA could be the best crypto to buy now if it can break above this key level.

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>But if GALA can overcome resistance at $0.050, a swift recovery back to early yearly highs near $0.088 is possible. GALA could well be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h3><strong>Akash Network (AKT)</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized computing resource network Akash Network (AKT) is attempting to break out of its recent downtrend.</p>
<p>AKT was last trading near $4.0, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/akash-network/">up 11% in the past 24 hours</a>. The token is still down around 40% from its yearly highs at $6.50, having been battered since late March.</p>
<p>But AKT is looking to break out of its recent downtrend. A break above the 21DMA at $4.20 could open the door to a pop higher to resistance-turned-support at $5.0.</p>
<figure id="attachment_200499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-200499" style="width: 819px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-200499" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18161729/1713457048-screenshot-2024-04-18-111719.png" alt="As AKT eyes a retest of this key level, it could be the best crypto to buy now.

<p>The prospect of quick potential gains means AKT could be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternate Investment Strategy to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer investors a great chance of making near-term gains. Indeed, altcoin investing can be very profitable if investors can reliably find undervalued projects and time the market well.</p>
<p>However, attempting to time the market comes with a lot of risks, given the high level of volatility in the altcoin market.</p>
<p>An alternative strategy that carries less risks relating to market volatility is investing in crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-a-crypto-presale/">presales</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ico-news/">ICOs</a>.</p>
<p>Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fund raising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token.</p>
<p>These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors.</p>
<p>Of course, presale investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket.</p>
<p>But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top presales being watched by analysts at Cryptonews.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Venture capital funding for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects has experienced its first quarterly rise since 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crunchbase </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/web3/venture-funding-bounces-back-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data published</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> today reveals that Web3 startups managed to secure just under $1.9 billion in funding across 346 deals in the first quarter of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This marks a significant 58% increase from the previous quarter, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the lingering downward trajectory of overall crypto VC interest.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto VC Funding Rises Amid Growing Optimism</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest surge in funding can be attributed to investors with a more long-term perspective on Web3, in contrast to the hype-driven &#8220;tourist investors&#8221; who were prevalent in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Chris Metinko, the author of the report, these investors are currently focusing their attention on the AI sector, indicating a shift in investment strategy. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Metinko explains that there is a growing interest in supporting the underlying infrastructure of the decentralized internet, rather than solely focusing on crypto wallets and lenders, which garnered substantial investments during the peak period of 2021 to 2022.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although big funding rounds were relatively rare in Q1, a few notable investments stood out. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exohood Labs, a company merging AI, quantum computing, and blockchain, secured a $112 million seed round at a valuation of $1.4 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EigenLabs, an Ether token &#8220;restaking&#8221; platform, raised $100 million in a Series B led by a16z crypto. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, Freechat, a decentralized social network built on blockchain technology, secured $80 million in a Series A round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These investments, along with others, contributed to the rise in valuations and the emergence of four new Web3 unicorns in Q1.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Next Few Quarters Will Be Crucial </span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the recent progress, the future of Web3 remains uncertain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Metinko suggests that the next few quarters will be crucial for determining the industry&#8217;s direction. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While investors anticipate a bounce-back in investment as the decentralized internet continues to develop, it may take another year for venture capital activity to stabilize after the exuberance of 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Factors such as the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the upcoming Bitcoin halving could also impact the market, as the prices of Bitcoin and Ether have been on the rise.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A recent example of significant funding in the Web3 space is Monad Labs&#8217; successful round, which secured $225 million led by Paradigm. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Monad Labs is a layer-1 blockchain compatible with Ethereum that offers faster transaction processing. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This funding round evokes memories of the golden era of crypto funding in 2021-2022 when L1 solutions attracted substantial investments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> revealed that it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/canadian-crypto-custody-firm-balance-sees-assets-reach-2-billion-amid-market-recovery.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has once again achieved $2 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-koreas-koda-sees-248-growth-in-crypto-assets-under-custody-in-second-half-of-2023.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">expanded by nearly 248%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the second half of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to analysts at Bernstein Research, crypto funds </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-asset-management-industry-could-reach-650b-five-years-up-from-50b-today-report.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">could reach a staggering $500 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to $650 billion within the next five years, a significant leap from the current valuation of approximately $50 billion.</span></p>
